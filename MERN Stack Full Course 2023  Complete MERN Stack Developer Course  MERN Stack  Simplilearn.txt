do you know according to indeed.com the
average salary of a month stack
developer in the US is 120 000 US dollar
per annum and it can go up to 200 000
per annum today's video will be a full
course on one stack for 2023. starting
from the basics to the advanced topics
we will start this full course with
react which is a front-end development
tool for creating web applications we
will cover from basic topics like
components props States and advanced
topics like methods in react and finish
it off by creating a beautiful portfolio
project using react.js next we will
cover node.js which is a JavaScript
runtime that allows developer to write
server-side code in JavaScript in
node.js we will cover topics like npm
which is a node package manager then we
will see rest API node.js authentication
with JWT and many more topics once we
are done with node our next step would
be to learn express.js so express.js is
a lightweight framework that allows
developer to create server-side web
applications quickly and easily in
Express we will learn about methods like
error handling in express.js how to
connect server side to the client side
and many more once we are done with all
three the next logical step would be to
understand mongodb where we will cover
mongodb from basic to Advanced we will
discuss data modeling operators
projection indexing aggregation in
mongodb and many more towards the end of
this full course we will cover interview
questions on each of these four
Technologies to make you interview ready
and you can land a great job in the
domain of man stack so without further
Ado let's get into this full course on
moon stack but before that if you want
to become a software developer consider
the course on full stack web developer
mean stack by simply learn and master
load necessary skills you can also
consider a postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development
check out the links in the description
box for more details you can also call
us on the numbers that are given below
and know more about the program hey
everyone I'm sure you're all aware that
every application that we use today has
something called the front end which is
the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data
now these three together form something
called as the full stack so hi guys
welcome to this video on what is full
stack by simply learn but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
never miss an update so here's what's in
store for you first we'll have a look at
what front-end development is
then we'll see some of the front-end
languages
then we'll move on to some front-end
libraries and Frameworks
then we'll see what back-end development
is understand some of the popularly used
back-end languages and Frameworks and
finally we'll have a look at the
database
so now what exactly is front end every
time you open a website it has several
UI components and once you click on a
particular icon say sign in in this case
you get navigated to the sign in or the
login page right so what happens is that
all of these items facilitate navigation
and utility
these are collectively called as the
front end so the front end is the
visible part of the website or the web
application which is responsible for
user experience the user directly
interacts with the front-end portion of
the website or the web application
thank you so now let's have a look at
some of the front-end languages so I'm
sure you've heard of HTML CSS in
JavaScript so these are collectively
called the front-end languages when it
comes to HTML it defines the structure
of websites and formats the web pages
it also defines text documentation so
let's look at a simple example
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
and I've displayed the message hello
welcome
so correspondingly my website displays
the same message
so HTML is responsible or defines what
is being shown on the website next up is
CSS now CSS is a style sheet that allows
you to alter and style different web
components beat size font spacing Etc it
makes the content on the website look
more decorative correct so now if you
have a look at the code here I've added
some styling I've changed the font style
to italic I've made the text bold and
I've changed the color to red and again
correspondingly all the changes are seen
on the website
moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful
client-side scripting language and it is
mainly used for enhancing the
interaction of a user with the web page
so again if you have a look at the code
here I've created a form wherein the
user can enter their name and I've also
displayed the message please enter your
name as a result an input box is made
available where the user can type in
their name now this is facilitated by
JavaScript so as I mentioned earlier it
is used to make web pages interactive
and bring the web applications to life
so next let's have a look at some
front-end Frameworks and libraries now
most of these are JavaScript Frameworks
and libraries first we have react then
there's angular there's view there's
jQuery and then there's bootstrap now
all of these help develop the front end
of the application however when it comes
to react angular in view it's not
necessary that you must know everything
to create a website one of them will be
sufficient however the usage of react is
on the rise and most of the developers
prefer using react jQuery and bootstrap
are also powerful Frameworks that can be
used used to create interactive web
pages now that you know what front-end
development is you must be wondering how
the data is being fetched and how this
data is being presented in front of you
on your screen correct now this is all
facilitated by the back end of the
application so let's understand what
back-end development is
now backend basically refers to the
server-side development of the
application
it is responsible for managing all the
database with the help of queries and
apis so every time the user makes a
request it queries the database and
retrieves the data from the database and
presents it to the user
and lastly it ensures data consistency
so now let's have a look at some
back-end languages and Frameworks
firstly we have node node and express.js
are packages provided by JavaScript
then there's python which is a very
popularly used language python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
popularly used to create the backend of
applications
then there's Java and Java provides
spring and Java server faces which are
also used for backend development then
there's c-sharp which provides
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC and other popularly used back-end
languages are PHP this Pearl and Ruby
database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps an
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL this postgresql
there's Microsoft SQL Server this Oracle
database and then there's mongodb but
how can we at simply learn help you if
you wish to make a career as a full
stack developer then a certification
will come in handy for that you could
head to our official website and look
for full stack development courses now
we offer the full step Java developer
Masters program
we also provide the postgraduate program
in full stacked web development and we
also provide the full stack web
developer mean stack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course hey everyone
welcome to another video by simply learn
in today's video we're going to be
comparing two commonly used technology
Stacks that is mean stack and non-stack
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure you hit the Subscribe button and
the bell icon to never miss an update
so first let's begin by understanding
what exactly is a technology stack
now a technology stack is a combination
of programming languages Frameworks and
tools that developers use to build a web
or a mobile application
now the two main components of any app
are the client side and then the server
side
and each layer of the application is
built atop of the other
thus creating a stack
now the server side is not visible to
the user but is programming languages
power the user side and create the logic
of websites and applications
when it comes to client-side now this is
everything that users can see on their
screens and where the interaction is
happening the three main technologies
that fall under client-side are HTML CSS
and JavaScript
so now that you know what a technology
stack is let's go ahead and understand
what exactly is mean stack
now mean stack is defined as the
collection of JavaScript technologies
that assist in building complex websites
right now mean is basically an
abbreviation that stands for mongodb
express.js angularjs and node.js
now this framework provides quick and
easy development of web and mobile
applications
it also provides popular plugins and
reduces time on system administration so
if you want to speed up the process of
web and mobile application mean stack is
an appropriate choice
now while talking about the components
mongodb here is used to store the data
of backend applications like Json files
express.js is a back-end application
that runs on top of node.js you have
angular which is the front-end framework
that runs the code on the browser
and then you have node.js which provides
a runtime system for JavaScript on the
backend web application
so this was all about mean stack
so let's go ahead and understand what
man stack is
now monstack like mean stack is also an
abbreviation so it stands for mongodb
express.js react.js and node.js now this
framework also provides quick and easy
development of web applications using
Java as its main component now it is
used for development of websites and it
makes use of libraries databases and
Frameworks now monstack ensures a smooth
development process and is becoming
increasingly popular in the development
Market
then again mongodb here it is a document
oriented nosql database that is used to
store back-end data then you have
express.js which is a layered framework
built on top of node.js and it takes
care of all the websites back-end
functionality and structure you have
react.js which is a JavaScript library
that creates user interface components
for web applications and then you have
node.js which is a runtime environment
capable of running JavaScript on a
machine right so this was monstag now
you must be wondering what exactly are
the differences between monstack and
mean stack so let's go ahead and look at
them
first up is the obvious difference that
in means tag we use angular while in
monstack we use react.js now angular is
obviously a JavaScript framework used to
build single page applications while
react is an open source JavaScript
library used to render components for a
smooth user experience
next up mean stack uses typescript
language while monstack uses JavaScript
and jsx now jsx is a combination of
JavaScript and HTML now since mean stack
uses angular the flow of data is
bi-directional that means any changes
made to the view part of the application
is reflected in the model part as well
and vice versa
but in the case of monstack which uses
react it uses unidirectional flow of
data meaning first the model state is
updated and then all the changes are
rendered to the view part of the
application
next up is that mean stack has a better
learning curve you need to know all the
concepts of angular like data binding
services routing bootstrap Etc
and in case of non-stack it offers
excellent documentation making
development extremely smooth
so now you must be wondering which one
to choose now you know what mean stack
is you know what monstack is you know
how they function what the stack
comprises of what are the different
types of Concepts that can be used Etc
but if you're wondering what to choose
then this section will help you clarify
the doubt so there are many companies
that readily use different types of
stacks for web development so companies
like Accenture raindrop Bungalow among
others use mean stack while companies
like the ubereats Instagram Walmart use
monstack
also both the stacks provide an
incredible user experience and stability
and scalability are the objectives of
both these Stacks now Enterprise level
projects require mean over Mon and mon
makes rendering the user interface
simpler and both of these are quick for
front-end development
however mean stack is good for large
scale applications and monstack is used
for faster development of smaller
applications so in conclusion one isn't
necessarily better than the other but
choosing the right stack for your
software process depends on the
front-end framework or related tools
that you would like to use right so if a
developer or team prefers using angular
they may choose to work with mean stack
meanwhile a developer or a team that
enjoys using react will gravitate
towards month stack so it's basically
just your choice and your requirements
in today's video we'll be learning all
about react.js so let's jump in and see
what's in store for us so we'll be
covering topics on what is react why
react features of react react
prerequisites and its industry Trends
let's go ahead and begin with what is
react react is a JavaScript library used
to build fast and interactive user
interfaces for both web and mobile
applications now one thing that makes
react extremely powerful is the the fact
that it's open source any user can
access its source code modify it and
enhance it in a typical model view
controller architecture react defines
the view part of the application it is
also responsible for how the app looks
and feels fun fact react was built by
Jordan walkie an engineer at Facebook
now let's go ahead and see how react
Works in real time consider a typical
web application say Instagram the entire
UI of the web page is divided into
several components we have the search
component a profile description
component stories component and a
postless component these components make
the code easier to debug and always
remain discrete components also make
development and maintenance of web
applications faster as multiple
developers can work simultaneously on
different components of the same web
application now let's see why react is
so popular these days the ACT helps in
creation of dynamic web applications it
also provides performance enhancements
now there are several performance
enhancements like virtual Dom and
one-way data binding we'll learn about
these topics a little later in the video
react uses reusable components now this
helps decrease the development time
react involves unidirectional flow of
data react also has a small learning
curve compared to other Frameworks like
angular react is much easier to learn
react can also be used for mobile
applications react recently release an
extension called react native that is
used for developing mobile applications
that are cross-compatible it also has
dedicated tools for easy debugging now
let's dive in to the features of react
first let's understand jsx jsx is a
syntax extension to JavaScript using jsx
we can add HTML to the Javascript file
all coding in react is done using jsx it
also helps in making the code easier to
understand and debug ultimately jsx is a
combination of JavaScript and HTML now
let's consider a small example cons
simple here is a JavaScript notation H1
tags indicate HTML again the semicolon
indicates JavaScript note that the
semicolon is not mandatory however it's
a good practice to include it moving on
the next feature is virtual dom dom dom
which is an acronym for data object
model actually defines how documents are
accessed and manipulated in a web page
it represents the entire structure of
the web page in the form of a tree
now let's see how this actually works
react creates a virtual Dom that is the
exact copy of the real Dom traditionally
whenever something changes in the web
application all objects in the real Dom
are updated this makes it extremely slow
let's see how react counters this now
consider two objects whose states have
been changed react now compares the
virtual Dom with the virtual Dom
snapshot that was taken right before the
update by comparing the new virtual Dom
with the pre-update version react
figures out exactly which virtual Dom
objects have changed now react only
updates those objects on the virtual Dom
this makes a big difference when it
comes to speed coming to the next
feature performance react uses virtual
Dom as discussed earlier virtual Dom
impacts the speed of the web
applications we also took an example of
Instagram and learned how multiple
components can affect the development
time they help improve performance
drastically the next feature is one-way
data binding this means information
Flows In Only One Direction One Way data
binding is specifically used when
information is displayed and not updated
remember that the components of react
are functional in nature that is they
receive information through arguments
and pass information via their return
values the next important feature is
extensions react has many extensions
that we can use to create full-fledged
front-end applications it provides
server-side rendering which means that
the application is rendered on the
server rather than in the browser react
native which is a react extension is
used for developing mobile applications
there are many other extensions that
react provides for every scenario in web
development now let's look at a few of
them react native lets you build mobile
applications using only JavaScript a
react native app is a real mobile
application and not just a web
application running on your mobile
devices thousands of applications like
Facebook Instagram Pinterest Skype use
react native the next popular react
extension as flux flux is the
application architecture that Facebook
uses flux implements a unidirectional
flow which makes it easier to understand
what actually is going on now let's see
how it works when we trigger an action
the dispatcher will get notified the
dispatcher receives actions and
dispatches them to the stores a store is
what holds the data of an application
stores will register with the
applications dispatcher so that they can
receive actions data from stores is
displayed in views actions define the
internal API of your application they
capture how anything might interact with
your application the last feature of
react is debugging react applications
are easy to debug thanks to the large
and active developer Community you can
practically debug react calls within
your browser now notice the small react
extension icon at the top right corner
this developer tool allows the user to
inspect the code and also easily debug
it moving on let's learn about the
building blocks of react components
state weight and props are the essential
Concepts that one should know before
implementing react they are the
foundation on which react is built now
what exactly are react components
components are the building blocks of
any react application react divides the
user interface into multiple components
wherein each component defines how a
particular element is viewed in the
application react components remain
discrete and are processed independently
another feature is reusability
components can be reused multiple times
across the application this reduces the
development time consider the following
code snippet a component is implemented
as a JavaScript class having some State
and a render method state is the data
which we want the component to render
the render method is responsible for how
the UI looks and feels to the user the
next concept is state state of a
component is an object that holds some
data this data influences the output of
a component every time the state of an
object changes the component is
re-rendered onto the screen now let's
see what props are props are short for
properties allow us to pass arguments or
data to components properties help make
confidence more Dynamic it is important
to Define all the properties their types
and their default value props are passed
to components in a way similar to that
of HTML tag attributes now consider the
following code Snippets this shows
exactly how properties are passed to
components also detailed illustrations
on components props and state will be
shown in the upcoming videos so stay
tuned for that moving on let's go
through some of the things that you
should know before you can actually
start working on react you should be
familiar with programming Concepts like
functions objects arrays and classes one
should also have a basic knowledge of
JavaScript and a familiarity with HTML
don't worry if you feel like you're not
good at them once you start working on
them you'll get a good hang of it
finally let's go through the impact of
react on the I.T industry and get
insights into the salaries of react
developers statistics show that react
developers earn way more than other web
developers according to pay scale the
average salary for a react developer in
the United States is a whopping 91 000
US Dollars the average salary for a
react developer in India is 7.25 lakhs
per annum over the recent years react
has gained immense popularity and is
being adopted by many companies
according to the data by Google Trends
Riyadh has had a better growth scale
compared to other Frameworks like
angular and view statistics show that
front-end developers have wholeheartedly
adopted this lightweight framework
foregoing other available options if you
are scared and have a knack for
front-end development react can help you
gain fantastic career opportunities
lastly talking about a few companies
that use react emotionally we have
Facebook Instagram Netflix Dropbox
WhatsApp among others in today's video
we'll be learning all about react
installation on windows so without
further Ado let's get started to set up
the react development environment we
need two things installed node and a
text editor of your choice so let's
begin by installing node.js we can head
to the official node.js website say
download
node.js so here you can see the windows
installer depending on your system you
can either download the 32-bit version
or the 64-bit version so I'm going to go
ahead and click on the 64-bit version
since it's already installed on my
system I'm not again installing node you
can follow the installation guidelines
and download it once you're done with
node installation you can go ahead and
download a text editor of your choice so
I'd suggest vs code so let's head to the
vs code page say download vs code click
on the first link and download the
64-bit version for Windows once you're
done with the installation of both node
and your text editor you can start
creating your first react application so
for that let's create a folder I am
creating it on my desktop while you can
create it in any of your drives let's
call it first react now open your
command prompt now you can type in the
path for the folder that you just
created so say CD
[Music]
first react now go ahead and type in the
command npm install
hyphen G create react app okay so this
command installs all the necessary
react.js modules now to check if the
version is correctly installed you can
type in create
react app version so you can see the
version here now let's continue and
develop your react application type in
the command create react app and you can
give a name to your application so I say
my app now this should take a couple of
minutes okay once you've successfully
created our application they say to
begin by typing the following commands
so let's do that save CD my app and npm
start this should typically start your
application and here we go all right you
can also open your application in the
text editor that you've downloaded so
let's go ahead and open vs code vs code
file open folder go to your desktop or
the drive that you've saved your folder
in first react my app and I say select
folder so as you can see all your
modules have been imported you can click
on app.js and start editing in today's
video we'll be learning all about the
most basic infrastructure of react.js or
components without delay let's begin and
look at what's in store for us so we'll
be touching on topics like what are
components types of components nesting
components higher order and pure
components and a brief description about
component life cycle all right to begin
with what exactly are components
components are the building blocks of a
react application wherein each component
represents a part of the user interface
now to make it more understandable
consider the Facebook home page the
entire UI can be broken down into
several elements say we have the
credentials component the sign up
component the image component and the
logo component notice that each
component adds something to how the home
page looks alright reusability is one of
the saline features of react components
one component can be reused several
times across the application and this
improves the development speed
components can also be nested one
component can internally consist of
several other components in its minimal
form a component must Define a render
method that specifies how exactly the
application looks and feels a component
can also receive properties from its
parent components also you'll get a
better understanding of all of these
when we start working Hands-On so don't
worry so moving on let's look at the
different types of components first we
have the stateless functional components
and then we have the stateful class
components now functional components are
typical JavaScript functions that return
HTML now they can be contained in a DOT
JS or a DOT jsx file coming to class
components these are regular ESX classes
however it's mandatory that they contain
a render method that in turn returns
HTML they can also be contained in dot
JX or a DOT jsx file okay then let's go
ahead and build our first react
application using components all right
so I've opened my text editor that is vs
code to build my application Also I
suggest you watch the react installation
on Windows video to help you get started
the video briefly explains how to
install node and how to start building
your first react application in my case
I've opened a folder called react
component tutorial and here in my source
folder I have app.js now app.js is the
main component that gets rendered to the
term let me show you that here in
index.js you pass app.js which is a
component that gets rendered to the
reactor so app.js consists of several
other components that can be nested so
as you can see app.js is a functional
component and before moving on let me
get rid of all the unnecessary code so
let me delete all of this
and return an H1 tag that says hello
welcome to Simply let me save it and if
you look at the browser you'll have
hello welcome to Centrelink now let's go
ahead and display another message say
this
is about components right
save it and let me check the browser it
gives you an error so jsx uses a
conventional rule which states that all
HTML tags have to be enclosed within a
div tag so for example I say div and I
enclose it so let me save and check my
browser again here you go so multiple
HTML tags have to be enclosed within the
div tag moving on let's create a first
functional component to do that I'll
first create a folder in my source
folder say components within that I'll
create a file say functional component
dot JS all right so the first thing we
have to do is import react so I say
import react from yeah the general
Syntax for a functional component
involves the keyword function and say
functional component now you say return
an H1 tag or I've already used H1 tags
so I'll say pair it off nice here this
is a functional component all right
before explaining to you how these
components are exported and imported let
me show you the general Syntax for a
class component so I create another file
say class component dot JS I again
import react from react the general
notation is using the class keyword
followed by the name of the class
extending from the base class
react.component so going ahead I say
class class component extends react dot
component now the key feature of a class
component is the usage of a render
method so I say render within braces I
say return a paragraph tag saying this
is the class component
so moving on let's see how these
components can be nested into the main
component that is app.js components can
be nested into the main component using
Import and Export keywords so as the
name suggests export feature is used to
export a particular file or a module and
import is used to import a particular
file or a module into the current
existing module so we have two different
types of exports you have default export
and just export or named export so a
default export is used to export just
one object be it a function a class a
variable from the file and there can
only be one default export per file and
when you're importing it you can specify
the address and use the word import
before it so let me show you how it
works let's go back to our editor and
then functional component and here I say
export default and the name of the
functional component that is functional
com so let me save this and going back
to my app.js I say import name of the
functional component that is functional
com from and I pass the path this
components slash functional component
also let me get rid of these unnecessary
files here now let's define functional
component in our app.js component so
here I say functional comp let's compile
it and check our browser here it says
this is a functional component moving on
to my class component it's the same
syntax here as well let's say export
default name of my component and in my
app.js I import it import class comp
From the Path and again I'll have to
Define it in my return method I save so
let me compile it and check my browser
it says this is the class component one
unique feature of default export is that
I can rename the file while I'm
importing it so for example I can rename
it as say FC and while I'm defining it
I'll have to make sure I use the same
naming conventions so I say FC again and
when I check it it says this is the
functional component there is literally
no difference the next type of export is
the named export or just export so a
named export can be used to export
multiple objects be it functions class
Etc from a file now there can be several
named exports from a single file one
hack is that while you're importing it
cannot be renamed so let me show you how
this works okay so let's create another
class in our class component so I'll
just copy paste this let me give it
another name say class comp 1 and then
message that I want to display is hey
I'm another class all right so when I'm
exporting it I don't want default so let
me take it off and say export here all
right in my app.js while importing it I
want to import both the classes so I'll
include them within curly braces here I
say class com comma class comp one and
then again I Define it here class comp
one let's compile it and run it and here
we go here you can see hey I'm another
class so we've successfully exported
both the classes from the class
component and imported it back in our
app.js component one advantage of using
named export is the fact that I can
choose to import the classes that I want
to now say for example I do not want to
import class component here so let me
take it off and here let me comment this
now let's compile and see hey I'm
another class the second class got
imported while the first class I was
defined earlier is not imported here
alright so next up we have higher order
and pure confidence now I won't get into
the nitty gritties of it because they're
Advanced topics but to give you a brief
Insight higher order components are
basically functions that take in a
component and return a new component the
whole ideology behind higher order
components is to facilitate the
reusability of component logic okay so
let's see how this works let's go back
to our code editor let's create a
component in our components folder let's
call the component
click dot JS all right so here we define
a class I use this snippet rce here we
go we get the entire format using the
small snippet rce and here I'm going to
make use of a button now see I use the
tab button and I'll say clicked one time
every time the user clicks on the button
the value gets incremented so for this
I'm going to use a variable say count
and I'm going to use the concept of
States so let's go ahead and Define our
variable count and initialize it to zero
so for that I'm going to use another
snippet called R const and here this dot
State equals my variable count
initializing it to 0. so let's define
the count variable in a render method so
I say const count equals this dot state
so every time we click on the button the
count value has to get incremented right
so we make use of an event called on
click equal is this dot update click Now
update click is going to be another
method that we have to Define now so
every time the button gets clicked this
method is called so let's go ahead and
Define the function so it is update
click equals is going to be an arrow
function and I say this dot set state is
nothing but count this Dot state DOT
count plus one okay and here we say
count times all right so once this is
done let's import our component in
app.js so here again I say import click
from components okay and let's define it
here so let's check our browser every
time we click on the button the value
gets incremented all right so let's go
ahead and create another component say
counter.js wherein every time the user
hovers the mouse on the button the count
value increases so let's go ahead and do
that I say
counter dot JS I'm again going to use
the snippet rce to create a class
component and here in my div tag I
Define a button and say incremented two
for now I say x so now let's go ahead
and add the event save button on Mouse
enter I'm gonna call the method this dot
increment count okay so once you're done
with that let's go ahead and Define the
increment count method I'm going to copy
the same code that I've mentioned in my
click.js so I say copy this all right so
one changes that I've changed the name
of the method and call it increment
count again let's define the count in
our render method so I say const count
equals this Dot and here I change X to
now let's go ahead and import it in our
app.js so I say import counter from
components and counter and let's define
it here all right let's save it and
let's run the code okay so as you can
see you see another button here
incremented to 0 and every time I move
my cursor on the button it increments
mind you I'm not clicking I'm just
hovering my mouse okay to learn how
higher order components work we'll have
to pass counter.js and click.js as
parameters to give birth to an entire
new component so for that let's go ahead
and create another component for our SOC
let's call it higher order dot JS okay
so I say import react from yeah after
that I say const updated component
equals original component that's going
to be an arrow function again and within
curly braces I Define my class that is
class say new component extends react
dot component inside let's define a
render method that Returns the original
component with a modification that is I
want to type the user I want to append
the user before the actual message is
displayed all right so let's go ahead
and close the tag and return new
component and let's export this say
export default updated component now we
import higher order.js in our counter.js
and click.js and pass these components
as parameters so let's do that let's go
to counter.js and here I say import
updated component from dot slash higher
order component and here while exporting
I say updated com and pass this as my
parameter let's do the same to click.js
here I import data.com from higher order
component and here I pass this as a
parameter now here in a higher order
component we've defined a property name
and initialized it to the user so we'll
have to include this in our other
components that's counter and click so
let's do that and here right before
incremented 2 I say this dot props dot
knee let me save it let me do the same
thing here and say this dot props dot
name so if you go back to our browser
here you can see it says the user
clicked zero times and the user
incremented to zero okay so this
basically shows how react Implements
reusability of components moving on our
next topic is pure components now
another way to create class component is
by extending pure component from react
to pure component avoid unnecessary
re-renders now how does it do it it does
not implement the should component
update method now you'll learn about
this method a little later in the video
now this method enables re-rendering of
components to the Dom but a pure
component on the other hand ensures a
shallow comparison of states and props
and checks if a re-render is actually
necessary only then does it render to
the Dom a react component can be
considered pure if it renders the same
output for the same state and props so
let's take an example to explain pure
components so let's go back to our vs
code and create two component classes
one for a regular component and the
other for a pure component I'm using
this example I'll show you exactly how
pure component is more helpful okay so
let's create a pure component.js file I
say pure com dot JS so here I'm going to
use a snippet rpce that is going to
create a pure component class let me get
rid of this export and here in my div
tag I'll display the text say I'm
the pure component all right now let's
go ahead and create a regular component
I may call it regular component.js and
here I'm going to use the snippet rce
and the message that I want to display
is I'm the regular component so to draw
a comparison between the regular
component and the pure component let's
create a parent component for the two so
let me create one here I'll call it
parent component.js and this is again
going to be a regular class component
and here I display the message I am the
parent component to change the state of
the component we're going to make use of
a Constructor so let's use the snippet
or const and here let me create
name you can give anything and I say
simply learn now we make use of the
component did Mount lifecycle method to
set a time interval now don't worry
about this we're going to learn about it
a little later in the video so moving
ahead I'm going to make use of the
method and say component did Mount and
here I say set interval the first
argument is going to be an arrow
function and the second will be the time
interval and I'm going to be setting it
to 3 seconds now within the arrow
function I'll make use of the set State
function to set the state of my property
however I do not change the name I keep
it simply on itself moving on let's
import your component and the regular
component into our parent component and
then pass name as a property so to do
that first import your com from Pure
component and then I say import regular
com from regular com.js and here let's
say regular com name equals this dot
state DOT name and I say pure component
name equals this dot state DOT me now
let's include the property name in both
our regular and pure confidence so to do
that let's just save this Dot drop dot
name and here I again say this dot prop
dot name and finally let's import parent
component into our app.js component so
here I say import parent come from okay
and here let me Define parent.com
so now if you look at the browser we
have and the parent I am regular
component simply learn and I'm the pure
component simply one we've got the
result as expected now to check if the
pure content is actually re-rendering or
not let's include simple console.log
statements so here I say CLG snippet and
here I say
pure component render and in my regular
component I do the same thing I say
console.log regular component render now
let's do the same in our parent
component as well here
say parent
component render all right so let's go
back to our browser and inspect it in
our console first the parent component
gets rendered then the regular component
and then the pure component after that
for every three seconds only the pairing
component and the regular component is
rendered for the same state and prop the
pure component is not re-rendered so in
conclusion pure components optimize
react codes and also improves
performance so coming to the last topic
component life cycle so basically
combine life cycle explains the stages
the component goes through the entire
life cycle of a component can be divided
into three parts we have mounting
uptation and unmounting so the first
thing that gets invoked in the life
cycle is component will mount it is
invoked right before the initial
rendering occurs then we have the
rendering method now once a component is
inserted into the Dom component did
Mount gets involved coming to the next
phase we have updation when a complaint
receives props component will receive
props gets invoked set state is called
when the state of the property changes
so every time there is a change react
decides whether the next component State
Should trigger a re-render or not to do
that should component update method is
called component will update is invoked
right before re-rendering after
re-rendering component did update is
called that makes updates to the Dom and
the last phase is unmounted component
will unmount method does all the
necessary cleanup and erases all the
allocated memory and Cycles
in our previous video we learned about
react.js components in detail and now
moving ahead let's learn about another
striking feature of react.js called
props props short for properties allow
the user to pass arguments or data to
components a pairing component can pass
additional information to its children
using props properties help make
components more Dynamic props are passed
to competence in the ways similar to
that of HTML track attributes now we'll
look at this a little later in the video
props in a component are read only and
cannot be changed one thing to remember
is that props are sent by the parent to
the children components hence the
children components cannot make any
changes to these props now that we've
learned about props in brief let's go
ahead and create our application using
props if you're new to this tutorial I
suggest you go to the react installation
and react competence video on our
channel so back in my code editor that
is vs code I've opened a folder called
react props and now I'm going to create
a component a class component and I'll
call it class
props.js so let's create the class
component I give rce the snippet and
here I display a message saying an H1
tag basically
all right
now let me get rid of export here and
import it in my app.js main component
here I say import
class props
all right now we Define the class
component in our render method
[Music]
all right
now if we go back to the browser you see
Hello Learners welcome to Simply
learning now let's say we want to
individually welcome every student
instead of retyping the message for
everybody we can pass their names as
props now let's see how to do that now
we pass the name as a property from the
main component that is app.js to the
child component and render this onto the
browser so let's do that so here while
I'm defining my child component I say
name
I save it and here in my child component
instead of learners
I say I use a keyword this
dot crops dot name
let me save it and if you look at the
browser we'll have hello learner1
welcome to Simply learn now let's go
ahead and welcome learner 2 and learner
3 so I again say class props name equals
learner 2.
all right so if we save and look at the
browser we'll have all the three
Learners displayed on the browser we can
also pass multiple props to the child
component now say for example we want to
welcome the student from a particular
place so we say welcome learner1 from
Place X so I can hear Define another
property say place
[Music]
say please
similarly I can do it for the rest too
Place y
now let's go back to our class props.js
component and here say hello
learner1 from this dot props dot place
let me save it and if you look at the
browser now we have hello Lana one from
Place X Place Y and play Z we can also
display whatever we want between the
opening and closing tags when invoking a
component now this is facilitated using
props.children reserved keyword now let
me explain to you how it's done with an
example here let's split the self and
closing tag into
an opening and a closing tag and in
between them let me display a message
within the paragraph tag let me say
and in my child component
after my H1 tag
let me use a paragraph tag and here
let's use the reserved keyword this dot
props top children
so let's save it
and now if you look at the browser you
can here see the message displayed child
component so prop stop children can be
used when components to not know about
their children ahead of time this is
commonly seen in components like sidebar
and dialog that represent generic boxes
so let's go ahead and create a button
tag and check again
so here I'll split it and add a button
tag
and say click
and let's check our browser
here we go we get the output as expected
all right we saw the usage of props for
class components similarly we can use it
for functional components so let's go
ahead and create a functional component
let me call it
I say import react from react
and then I say function
function props
and here I return an H3 tag
say this is functional component
and I'll return another H3 tag saying
hello learner
so let me save this
and let's export it export default
function props
and import it in our app.js again import
function problem
[Music]
function problem
and here in our render method let's
define it
let me call function prop
name
let me give learner 4.
and
place
Place say a
let me close it and back in our
functional component instead of learner
I save
props dot name
let me save it
now if you look at our browser it gives
us an error it says props is not defined
so let's go back to our code editor and
pass props here
to a functional component also let me
Define hello props.name
from
props dot place
let me enclose it within the div tag
here
[Music]
let me save it and now if you look at a
browser here we go we get the output as
expected
so let's begin and learn what exactly is
a state in react typically a state is an
object that stores the values of
properties belonging to a component now
these values can change over a period of
time either via user interactions or
network changes and the state helps
facilitate this functionality every time
the state changes react re-renders the
component to the browser the state is
initialized in the Constructor a state
can also store multiple properties a
method called set state is used to
update the value of the state object now
this function performs a shallow merge
on the new and the previous state
conventionally a shallow merge ensures
that the previous state values are
overwritten by the new state values
moving on in our previous video we
learned about props and although props
and state dictate and control the
behavior of a component they have
significant differences so let's go
ahead and draw a comparison between the
two firstly props in a component are
used to pass data and event handlers to
its children while State on the other
hand is used to store the data that has
to be rendered on the web page props are
immutable once said by the parent they
cannot be changed State holds volatile
data and can be changed over time props
can be used in functional and class
components while state is restricted to
class components props are set by the
parent component while a state is
generally updated by event handlers now
that we've learned all about State let's
go ahead and build an application to see
the working of State all right so in my
code editor that is vs code I've created
my application say State and here in my
source folder I have my app.js file now
here I'm gonna get rid of all the
unnecessary code that I'm not going to
be using Also I suggest you go through
the react installation on Windows video
to help you get started with creating
your first application so let's create
our class component say class app
extends react dot component inside I
have a random method that returns an
HTML tag let's display a message welcome
let's follow the jsx conventions and
enclose all the HTML tags within the div
tag so I say div
class name equals app we also have to
import the app.css file import
app.css and so we save it and if you
look at the browser we have welcome now
let's beautify our code to do that let's
add some styling so here in my app.js
class component I say Styles equals
and I say font style and I set it to say
bold and I say color say teal and here
in my H1 tag I say style equals this dot
Styles so let me save it and if we look
at the browser now we have welcome in
teal and it's bold now let's go ahead
and create a class component to
understand state so first I create a
folder and I call it components and
inside this folder I create a class
component and I call it newcomp dot JS
and I use the snippet rce to create the
class component to give you an insight
into what we are doing today we'll
display a message asking the user to
subscribe to Simply learn once the user
clicks on the Subscribe button we
instruct them to click on the Bell icon
and finally we display a thank you
message now to do all of this we're
going to make use of state and as
mentioned earlier we initialize the
state of object in a Constructor so
let's use the snippet R const to create
a Constructor now in the state object we
initialize a property let's call it
message and we display a message saying
subscribe to Simply learn now let's save
it and here in our render method let's
say class name equals app and let's
create an H3 tag and within the tag I
displayed the message so I say this dot
state DOT message let's save it and now
let's import it in our app.js component
so I'll get rid of export here and here
I say
import new com from components and new
com and let's define it here and say new
so we save it and look at the browser it
says subscribe to some Clan all right
again to make our code look more
presentable let's add in Styles so I'll
just copy the same styles that I've
added here and I'll paste them here and
instead of bold I make it italic I and I
change the color to say purple and again
in my H3 tag I Define style and
initialize it to the store Styles so let
me save it and now if you look at the
browser it's in italic and it's in
purple
okay so moving ahead let's create a
button that reads subscribe and once the
user clicks on it the button should read
subscribed and the message displayed
above should instruct the user to click
on the Bell icon to do that let's first
create a button the message that I want
the button to read is subscribe however
this message gets changed once the user
clicks on the button so instead of
explicitly mentioning subscribe here I
create a prop I say sub and I say
subscribe here and back in my render
method I'll say this dot state DOT sub
so let's save it and if you look at the
browser now you have a button which
displays a message subscribe now once
the user clicks on the button the
message displayed should change to click
on the Bell icon to never miss an update
so let's create an event handler for
that so here button on click I call
another method and let's call the method
button change okay so this method should
update the state and change the message
and sub values to do that we make use of
a set State method now our state can be
updated in response to event handlers
server responses or prop changes now all
the updation can be done using the set
State method now this is the general
syntax used by the method we'll however
look at this further in the demo now the
set State method conventionally enques
all the updates made to the component
State and instructs react to re-render
the component and its children with the
updated State now let's go back to our
code editor and look at the working of
this method now here I Define the arrow
function button change if you are not
familiar with arrow functions I suggest
you read up on them and this is the
general syntax and here I say this dot
set State and inside I change my message
to hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update and myself value changes to
subscribed let's save this and now if
you look at the browser when we click on
the Subscribe button the message changes
to hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update so moving ahead let's use a Bell
icon so that the user can click on it
once he clicks on the image the image
changes and a thank you message appears
on the screen so for that I have two
images I have Bell a and Bell B so I
drag and drop both the images in my
components folder alright now let's
import these images into our newcom.js
file here I say import Bell a from Bell
a DOT PNG and again I say import Bell B
from Bell B dot PNG all right let me
save it to display the image on the
screen we make use of the image tag now
this tag has two attributes one is the
source attribute that specifies the URL
and the other is the alt attribute that
specifies an alternate text for the
image so here in my component I say I
make use of a paragraph tag that will
help display the image in the next line
and then I use the image tag now since
my image changes once it's clicked I
have to define a property and pass the
event handler click that will update the
image so here before specifying The
Source let's go back to our state and
Define another
property that is image URL and let's set
it to Bell a since that is the image
that I want to display first let me save
it and here in my image tag I say Source
equals this dot state DOT image URL and
then we have the all tag and I do not
want to display any message so I leave
it as it is now let's save it and if we
look at the browser we have a bell
displayed however now let's change the
dimensions of the bell I do not want
such a huge bell so back in my vs code I
Define style with width say 30 pixels
and a height with again 30 pixels let me
save this and now if you look at the
browser we have a smaller icon so once
the user clicks on this image the image
changes and the message displayed here
gets updated to do that we'll have to
Define an event so let's go back to our
vs code and here in my image tag let's
say on click and Define a method say
this dot image change and now we Define
this method here as the image change I
make use of a narrow function again and
again I use the set State method I
update the image so I say image URL is
now set to Bell B and the message is
updated to thank you happy learning
so let's save this now and if we look at
the browser we see the image and once
clicked on it the image gets updated and
the message changes so finally Let me
refresh the browser once and show the
full execution Let me refresh following
the instructions let's click on the
Subscribe button and now it says hit the
Bell icon and once I do that the image
updates and the message changes so let's
jump to the coding part and see what's
we are going to create so before we jump
let's open our terminal to install some
commands here I've already created my
react project you can also create a
react project it is very simple just
type a command npx
npx
create
react app and then the folder name in my
case it's
and just enter it it will create a
portfolio app for you so I have already
created so I'm not gonna enter this so
let's cut this
after that let's begin with our
code
what you have to do is write a command
npm
react
install first install react
router
Dom
and then press enter it will install
react router Dom in your system
but before install this command you must
have installed npm in your system
so let's move forward
and enter
I have already installed this command
but just to tell you guys I'm entering
okay meanwhile it'll take couple of
seconds meanwhile I'm going to create a
folder inside this source
and let's name this folder
and
let's clear this terminal
now what we'll install is material UI
icons so for that the command is npm
install
add material
slash
icon
you'll press enter and it will take a
couple of seconds again mode to install
this command
I have already installed these commands
in my system
press just to clear you guys I'm
installing them again
so
let's
start our development process
inside this
okay
now let's open this app.js inside this
I am going to import here
after that
I am going to import the CSS file of
this I'm dot CSS
forward
third
Dot
SC
issors
okay
now let's close this after that let's
create a function
app
say this
let's return
if
class name
app
after that let's close this
yeah
fine
the main part is to export this file
so we are going to write export default
app
let's save it
now let's again open the terminal
by just pressing Ctrl Place back type or
you can just go here and just type new
terminal
here we'll write in view start

let me check that everything
if I had a functions

let's see now it's saying
okay we're close we have an important
this
let's import this
foreign

and let's see everything looks like
okay
it's taking time to install that's
just move forward
after this inside this ordered list will
created
live opponent inside this we'll write
link
let's save it now again
let's import this one also thought
[Music]
link
and report somebody I shot it down that
we have installed
yeah throughout the town let's just save
it
okay it's working fine now simply not X
okay
it's starting to look good
you have to add things here now
inside this link part let's
link here
two
so
and insert that let's write
first part okay
it's fine
let's copy this component and you leave
this
three four five
hair will write
a home
out
about portfolio
portfolio
right
right vlogs
and then
contact page
let's just save it
it is successfully compiled so these are
the things that we have added
now the next step is
let's add boom
to do is
on today's news
creative Dev
inside the place
let's leave it uh change
let's add the
and and the DVD where icon here
of many outside
yeah inside this let's give it a class
name
I mean you know
okay
let's close this
okay let's save it
and exploring is done
yeah yeah it's already been added now
you can see the feature of react
this is we use the material UI icon
a new book outline and automatically
it's been called inside this
let's now just run this and see this is
the icon that we needed okay fine
isn't it looking cool right now only
okay
let's work on the
header.css
or scss
you can use whatever
position that you like now
the first thing you even know
save this header
[Music]
version
just play let's make the display Flex
only
well it should come and horizontally
so the main item Center
you can change the position
that's right position
absolute
red index one
okay
that's now I did
the second thing is
okay
header
inside this header logo will give you a
much enough
I guess
it's fine for that
words
okay
[Music]
about portfolio blog and contact here
so let's move forward with the code
[Music]
to
zero and Auto
we are making this profile nice
sponsor so that's why we have used which
I have also used URL
audit list
and let's
set this really
also and I
skip into Einstein
[Music]
margin
[Music]
one room
after that it's looks good
yeah
we have used
okay
let's look at that
check
so let's ride
next
one thing I forgot to tell you that if
you're using like CSS here I'm using
scss if you're using CSS you can just
write after this UL tag audit list then
you can use like this
URL Li and inside that you can write or
you can just write Li and inside that
these commands we don't need to write
this inside the alert list only
okay
now let's add
let me give you
in production
from a couple of minutes to add it
yeah
let's see
if you find
let's write text declaration one
for that
text translation
let's write down this one
uppercase
color this those
I don't need
this
of that what does it
not
good
let's add it to partly
that's I don't
Ginger
after this
to your
let's make this big
clicks after that let's give it the
margin of
right
I think
1.5 would be enough
dot let's read
inside this I guess yeah
so in CSS if this was the case
like this
we have created hairline another
class of menu
in that we have written
you have to write all the
elements okay
RPI using this is CSS so inside this
this is the syntax that they follow okay
let's write cursor
pointer
margin of right
yeah one is enough
you'll also get the source code of this
in the description box
you can check it out
okay
it'll be helpful for you just follow me
throughout this video and in the end you
will see an amazing portfolio for you
guys okay
right close
okay
close
portfolios are really amazing or like
freshers too
get a job
because in these kind of projects you
learn so many new things
okay
so let's just save it
okay
the pointers yeah everything's look good
without looking like more space here
let's start with this then
let's write
okay
that things look good
let's see
it looks fine
let's add the hardware effects
but the whole effects will be created in
this
let me just get it
for you guys so
will be more
clearer
let me just add
for the everywhere
let me just copy the stack
okay
I mean you will see it be very bold
now let's save it it's working fine now
okay
inside this anchor tag only
that should
be effect by and
use the keyword name power
at this let's give it the Border
button
three pixels would be fine solid in
color and the red is my color
let's save it and see what's the effect
okay as you can see it's looking
beautiful right
just be with me throughout this tutorial
and you will love the results okay
so
let's just need this clean
code should always look clean
okay
it can be read properly you can read it
properly
so
uh to this close we're gonna go with
our code
I don't know why this cross is still
looking
let's close I have written the
functioning but
let's see it's not fetching it right I
guess
no it shows I'll do that
you guys okay let's see
what's the issue here
let's go to another fight
close close okay
[Music]
good
let's see
[Music]
right
let's find out
foreign
let's open the road
let's make this
like this
now let's save it
okay fine the crosses
clean
and have fuel
and support
here
so if it will be like this
tablet mode
find your things
if it's not hard right
let's make this
okay
to work on this part so
let's see validations coming
up
okay fine we have to still work on
it's right here
let's write this code again let's save
this file
if you know
that
going after the return let's write it
against
active
and make over
um
[Music]
but
State books function false
let's try to function now
constant
show
a new
inside this let's give a better function
and inside this
step
always
this will do a strictly active this is
the meaning of this
save it and see the changes it's showing
actually it's not defined okay
to find really
suits
one error is still coming okay fine
yeah two
we end up stage okay find everything
will look good
let's see what's the issue here
close to me
oh my God
oh yeah
now it's fine
we're going in North Station now
let's see because
finding errors and resolving them is
very important for a developer
increase your knowledge into the
specific language you are working on
so whenever you get any difficulties in
your code just take help from someone
Google it and you'll find the answer I'm
sure
okay let's find out
show me images
[Music]
close
once like
inside this
show
many
okay fine
save it let's see the output
no let's inspected
fine hair
this is okay
the bones failed to the list load Source
man Cloud not load contain okay it's
expressed
let's meet with a center
it's not insane toilets
and only
the logo okay
don't listen yeah
thanks much and then said between them
is the one who is fine
the margin is let's make it 1.2 here
in between them
it's not about three persons hold it
okay
so let's team this bud
right on click click
on this
Village
[Music]
okay
let me save it it's compiling
successfully
the space in between them
that's
working for you
let's here write a function
and it's right
let's just complete this uses file now
because
it should be located by now let's write
media
and set this max aid
okay
my type would be fine
it will increase it
okay
[Music]
just if I contend piece
between
display flicks
through here it should come inside that
function okay
on this one
Foundation
[Music]
is
[Music]
okay
and with a church
this one with some actions
so very high display next
time
and X direction should be
there will be
mobile option on what should be
these are the little things that you
should
understand while implementing any
project or something
but it's very tricky also there's so
many things that you have to
stand
set okay
find background color is very important
through me
said this looks right
now
okay
[Music]
now let's find
it's this
we will
[Music]
as you
I think CSS is very lengthy process but
it's cool also we'll learn so many new
things by implementing
okay
[Music]
[Music]
much
honestly
do around
the god let's
just build it

cool and responsive
coming back to our code

with the class name
contact let's save contact
you'll love the result in the end I'm
sure link
to just to link the app
I'm going to add the empty file
path
so I will get Linked In The Arrow
pack
class name
of
Arrow
let's just close this
okay
I mean things looks fine okay yeah
that's the reason here
yeah
still we have to
import this link
from react router down
link from
via router down let's save it
now
okay yeah we have to import the arrow
back from
material UI
I'll go back
from
all right
I can select save it okay fine
everything's look good now
okay yeah just create another div
class name input
where the user will input their detail
or if anyone wants to send a message or
something
inputs
after that I'm going to create one H1
which will be the header
contact
me okay
after that I am going to create
and put types which is input
type which is text
and the placeholder would will come
inside that with name
let's close this
and let's copy this few times copy
paste okay
the second thing that a user wants is
email
and the third thing that I want is the
message that they want to send or
something
and class name is
SN checks because this box gonna be the
big one no the name one is like the row
type email one is also the same but the
message box should be big that's why I
have written here the class name
so I'll go and edit it inside my
CSS file
inside this let's create a button
of send
let's save it
now I'm going to open my contact CSS
file
to add some CSS
on that
let's give it a width of like
100 percent
height of 100 percent
then the background color should be
White
I might repeat
after that
Fried data inside that the color
B
text decoration we don't need let's go
and write none
dot input that we just taken
that will inputs right
and
so let's write here
width of 60 percent
eight of
18
percent
margin of 0 and Auto
and then
they should be
X
Flex direction
of calling
and Alignment item should be Center
and then justify content
Center yeah
now what we will
work on the edge
which one inside this
the color
I have noted down the color this let's
write it RGB
[Music]
82
comma 76
76.
okay
let's click on the input type now
let's give it a width
times Center
right then
should be 20 pixels
outline
and and
the Border should be also
let's work on the last few steps of this
application
that Ding bottom
then
after that let's click on the button
part
ing will give up 10 pixels and
40 pixels
background color or just background only
because always pointer
chin
well uh
border of one of one pixel solid
we have to declare the color also so
we're gonna give it a
color blue
yeah
okay
now color is defined
no it's not defined so let's get link
but let's
give it a little darker
yeah this is fine
text
let's
a wood at media
Max height
Max width will start with
550
pixels
inputs
inside this input I'm gonna take
very tough
and when the input size would be
pending
and then 15 pixels let's save it
and okay fine fine inside the app.jss
Let's see we have declared the contact
page here
let's save everything now it's
successfully compiled
so this is the final step of our
application
so these are the header part mean part
that we have created here
so you can see the hover effect
isn't it looking nice no you can just
write a mail
email ID message and just send it
isn't it looking amazing
you can always improvise the projects we
have created so you can also improvise
this so with this we have reached the
end of this video
onto your screen you can like a picture
add new ones search your profiles and do
much more
although it provides a seamless user
experience there's a lot that goes in
the back end as well
so every application typically consists
of the front end the back end and the
database
together they form the full stack
so what exactly is front-end development
then now front-end development is the
part of web development that develops
and creates the website's front-end
elements or features
now a front-end developer in a sense is
responsible for everything that you see
it could be text alignment navigation
colors Etc
now the main objectives of front-end
development is responsiveness and
performance
so now that you know what front-end
development is let's look at the skills
that will help you land a job
first up is the foundation
so first things first to become a
front-end developer you need to start
with HTML move on to CSS and JavaScript
now these are the actual fundamental
languages for front-end development HTML
is used to structure our web pages CSS
is used to make them beautiful and
JavaScript is used to make the program
run and add interactivity
however knowing just these will not help
you you will have to learn the second
important skill that is Frameworks
now there are several front-end
Frameworks that make development way
easy now to name a few or the most
important ones we have react there's
angular
View
jQuery and Amber
now I'm sure you must have heard of
these Frameworks react is a UI
development Library written in
JavaScript
all the react is just the library and
not a framework its usage is rampant
nowadays react goes beyond simple UI and
has many extensions like flux and react
native for complete application
architecture support
talking about angular again this is an
open script JavaScript framework based
on typescript
so as a framework anchor offers
advantages and it also provides a
standard structure for developers in a
team to work with
you know it allows users to create huge
applications that are easy to manage
talking about view it is also an open
source JavaScript framework and is again
used to build user interfaces for single
page applications
now I'm sure you must have heard of
jQuery which is again a trendy
JavaScript framework and application
development platform it is leaner it is
fast loading and comes with features
that make life of a JavaScript
application developer more accessible
it is used more and more to be the
foundation and the primary driving force
of web development today
and lastly we have Ember which is again
an open source JavaScript client-side
framework it comes with built-in
environment with fast rebuilds Auto
reload and a test Runner
so these are some of the Frameworks that
you're expected to be proficient at now
the third skill that is crucial is
Version Control System
now we use Version Control Systems to
track our code history and work more
collaboratively with others that's why
you'll find that in every job
description now there are multiple
Version Control Systems available in the
market today there's git there's sub
version
Etc so just focus and git which is the
most popular one and don't worry about
other Version Control Systems knowing
these Version Control Systems will
definitely add more credibility to your
resume the fourth skill that is crucial
is the CSS preprocessor
now to give you an insight into why we
need preprocessors CSS is an old
language and it has its own limitations
if you write CSS for medium or large
size applications your code starts
looking messy so every time you want to
change something you end up breaking
something else
instead we can make use of a CSS
preprocessor now a preprocessor is a
program or a tool that lets you generate
CSS from a different language that is
better and more compatible than CSS
so instead of using plain CSS you can
use another language that looks pretty
similar with CSS we give our code to a
CSS preprocessor that converts it into
plain CSS which every browser
understands that's the purpose of CSS
preprocessors there are many of these
available today there's SAS less and
stylus to name a few
and lastly the most important skill
required is testing and debugging now a
very important aspect of web development
is to make sure that the end result is
error free
of bugs and seamless experience for the
user
therefore the ability to test and debug
a website is another essential skill
that a front-end developer needs to have
there are various methodologies that can
enable front-end developer to make sure
that the websites or the product not
only looks good but also functions
smoothly so although these are the top
five skills that a front-end developer
must possess they must also have good
communication and interpersonal skills a
good understanding of apis and how the
app needs to behave is crucial to make a
good developer
so you must be wondering how can simply
learn help you with this
well you could get started by acquiring
a simply learned certificate all you
need to do is head to our simply learned
page and type in full stack developer
you'll get a brief overview of the
course and what it offers if it suits
your requirements you can go ahead and
enroll for it having this course
certification will definitely boost your
resume so what exactly is node.js now
consider a scenario where a user
interacts with a web application the
user only interacts with the front end
of the application but there's a lot of
work that goes behind the scenes now in
a web application there's a front end a
server and a database the front end is
developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consists of
MySQL or mongodb so node.js is an open
source cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment for running server-side
applications it is used to develop i o
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startup node.js was developed by Ryan
Dal in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.3.0
now that we know what node.js is let's
go ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution node package manager has
around 50 000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of node.js Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an API to return data node.js
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justify the
popularity of node.js platform and why
it is being adopted by large number of
organizations and businesses today so so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of node.js
node.js consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
JavaScript libraries which are used in a
node.js application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application
node.js application has many modules to
provide basic functionality needed for a
web application some of them could be
HTTP util FS URL query string stream and
zlip next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and SCD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now node.js is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of node.js runs in a
single thread to take take advantage of
multi-core systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
node.js processes to handle the load a
cluster can be added to an application
in this way here's a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in node.js are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some node.js Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
node.js applications experience four
types of Errors we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in node.js are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
an error that would occur when we divide
a number by zero now this error would
crash the node.js application and so we
should handle this error here's a small
code for you next up we have streaming a
stream is an abstract interface for
working with streaming data in node.js
streams are objects that let you read
data or write data continuously there
are four types of streams first one is a
readable these are the types of streams
from which data can be read writeable
these are the types of streams to which
data can be written duplex these are
both readable and writable streams
lastly we have transformed these streams
can manipulate the data while it is
being read or written moving on to the
next component buffer the JavaScript
language has no mechanism for reading or
manipulating streams of binary data
buffer is a module that allows handling
streams that contain only binary data an
empty buffer of length 10 can be created
by this method next up we have domain
domains provide a way to handle
different i o operations as a single
group domain module intercepts errors
that remain unhandled there are two
types of methods that are used for
intercepting these errors firstly we
have internal binding in this case the
error emitter executes its code inside
the arrow method next up is the external
binding now here the error emitter is
explicitly added to a domain via its add
method the next component is the DNS the
DNS module enables name resolution for
example it is used to look up the IP
addresses of host names DNS module is
used to connect to a DNS server and
perform neem resolution by using the
method dns.resolve the DNS module is
also used for performing name resolution
without a network communication by using
the method dns.lookup the next component
is a debugger node.js includes an out of
process debugging utility accessible via
a V8 inspector and built-in debugging
client this node.js debugger is not
feature packed but supports simple
inspection of code it can be used in the
terminal by using the inspect keyword
before the name of the Javascript file
in order to inspect a file say
myscript.js you can use the following
method now that we are familiar with all
the major parts of node.js let's go
ahead and learn about the node.js
Express framework Express is a flexible
node.js web application framework that
provides a wide set of features to
develop both web and mobile applications
you can assume Express as a layer built
on top of the node.js that helps manage
the server and the routes now let's have
a quick look at some of the core
features of Express framework it is used
to design single page multi-page and
hybrid web applications it allows the
setting up of middleware to respond to
http requests it defines a routing table
that is used to perform different
actions based on the HTTP method and URL
it also allows Dynamic rendering of HTML
Pages based on passing arguments to
templates now moving on let's take a
quick example of a simple hello world
program now this is developed using
Express framework to gain a better
understanding alright first up we have
the WHERE Express now this is used to
import Express framework into our
node.js application now the app.get
method is a callback function with
parameters request and response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the HTTP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the node.js
use cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate node.js first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their server services to node.js
the reasons why the company chose to use
node.js were application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is with basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around 514 billion US
Dollars according to the fortune Global
500 list in 2019. again the reasons why
the company chose node.js were
asynchronous IO and efficient handling
of concurrent requests now asynchronous
IO which is a form of input output
processing allows other processing to
continue before the transmission has
finished node.js is able to efficiently
handle concurrent requests with the use
of thread pool and event cues Uber Uber
is an American multinational ride
hailing company offering services that
include peer-to-peer ride sharing right
service healing and food delivery the
reasons why the company chose node.js
were asynchronous i o quick iterations
and active open source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now node.js is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
as an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose
node.js were reduced access times
handling of data intensive tasks and the
fact that the servers are active 24 7.
now NASA has lots and lots of data and
using node.js has really helped them in
reducing the access times it is also
continuously handling and working with
large streams of data node.js is highly
stable which helps in keeping the server
active 24 7. next up we have PayPal now
PayPal is an American company operating
a worldwide online payment system that
supports online money transfers as
opposed to traditional methods like
checks and money orders the reasons why
the company chose to use node.js were
the fact that node.js has extremely fast
build times it allows tasks to be
carried out with fewer lines of code
when compared to other server
Technologies like Java and PHP and
node.js being data intensive efficiently
handles a large amount of data next up
is medium medium is a popular online
publishing platform developed by Evan
Williams and launched in August 2012.
the main reasons why the company chose
to use node.js were a data driven
applications now these applications are
ideal for being interfaced with node.js
servers B to run a b tests now A B
testing is essentially an experiment
where two or more variants of a page are
shown to users at random and statistical
analysis is used to determine which
variation performs better lastly node.js
server maintenance is simpler than its
counterparts moving on to the last topic
of this session industry Trends now
node.js developers are in demand across
the globe since many companies are
adopting JavaScript libraries according
to Forbes it is one of the top 10 most
in-demand jobs according to note Source
the total number of node.js downloads
increase by 40 in the last one year the
use of node.js in production has
increased dramatically since its release
in 2010. with early adopters such as
LinkedIn PayPal and Netflix among others
node.js has seen an exponential increase
in its use in web development the
popularity of node.js is also accounted
to JavaScript now since JavaScript is
the most popular language as evidence
from a survey conducted by stack
Overflow in 2019 many developers can
start working on node.js library with
not much of a learning curve node.js
developers are being offered better
salary options than another web
technology developers according to pay
scale the average salary of a node.js
developer in India is around 6 lakhs 13
000 rupees per year the average salary
of a node.js developer across the United
States is around 105 000 US dollars per
year in this video we'll help you
install node.js on your Windows system
so without further Ado let's begin the
first thing you need to do is download
node.js from their official website so
go ahead and type download node.js
navigate to their official website and
here
you can see the 64-bit version so go
ahead and download that once the
download is done go ahead and run the
downloaded node.js installer
accept the license agreement keep the
default settings as it is
and then say install
so with that we finish the installation
process
once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed to
do so we first open the command prompt
and then type in a few commands to
verify the successful installation we
type in this command
node hyphen V now this command Returns
the version and if it Returns the
version it means it has been
successfully installed
so here we go it Returns the latest
version
now the final step is to update the node
package manager now this npm is bundled
with node.js which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes so to do that type
in the command npm
install npm
hyphen hyphen Global now that we're done
with the installation of node let's go
ahead and Implement a small program for
that we make use of a text editor in our
case we've installed vs code so go ahead
and download vs code once you're done
with the installation this is what vs
code looks like so go ahead and click on
file and create a new file it's going to
be a simple program where you're going
to print a hello world message on the
web browser to do that we make use of
HTTP modules so node comes with built-in
HTTP modules to transfer data across it
so for that we make use of a require
method we create a variable first say
where
HTTP equals required and just say HTTP
within single quotes
now the HTTP module can create an HTTP
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method so let's go ahead and type
the code
say http
dot create
server and internally it consists of a
function
now the parameters to this function are
request and response now the response is
basically used to write to the client so
we say response dot write and here we
type in the message say hello world
welcome
to this tutorial
once you're done with that you end the
response
so the server listens to a port number
to display the message by default it
listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file
say demo.js maybe demo1.js and they save
now to run the program you have to open
the command prompt so open your command
prompt
and mention the path to your file so in
our case it's our desk saved on the
desktop so CD
desktop and now to run it say node
demo one dot JS now we navigate to your
browser
and say localhost 8080 and here we go
our message is successfully displayed so
let's talk about the node.js
architecture and understand why it's so
good
so to begin with uh node.js has what's
called a single threaded event Loop
architecture and this allows you to be
able to handle many many concurrent
clients at the same time it's just a
very flexible way of being able to scale
up your support for many clients
and then in addition to that we have the
JavaScript event based model along with
the JavaScript callback mechanism that
allows you to have this standard
approach to being able to connect with
and talk and discuss interactions
between the client and the server it's
good to have these kind of Standards
where you're not using something that's
unique to a specific framework or a
specific technology and this just makes
it so it's a more accessible for
everybody
so if we look at the actual node.js
server itself everything centers around
the the concept of the event Loop and
the event Loop has a a an event queue an
operation completed um fire request
threaded pull and then it'll actually do
the actual computation or the file
system interaction
all of this interconnects in a nice
seamless Loop the great thing again with
node.js is that it's not new technology
it's been around for almost a decade
it's very very well tried out many of
the largest websites out there are runny
node.js
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the node.js architecture so let's
talk about requests
so the way that the request works is
that you have your framework such as
angular on the client and that will then
send a request to the web server there's
many ways that those requests can happen
through web workers through forms and
through other interactions but at some
point a request is sent to the server
and so these requests can be for data
they can be for deleting data they can
be for updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the queuing
and threading process that centers
around the event Loop and this is where
node.js really excels because it's able
to use that single threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of requests
so it receives the actual request and
starts the event queue and this is where
a single threading process starts is by
queuing everything up appropriately
and then it then maintains the thread
within a pool so you have the queuing
process as one action and then you have
a threaded pull which manages those
threads as well
and then we have an event Loop which you
know goes through as you receives and
processes those requests
and they're funny what we're doing is
we're actually then going to be
interacting with a system and that could
be a database it could be a cloud system
it could be an API file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
node.js server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment
and so this talk a little bit about that
workflow so requests come in they go
into the event queue and they get
spiraled through the event Loop and then
we have a non-blocking operators which
are going to be doing the input output
polling such as KQ e-poll and other
services and from there we're also going
to be then interacting with a threaded
pool and we're using the blocking
operations to manage that threaded pull
and that threaded pool is going to now
then go outside of the server and
interact with something beyond the
server so whether that is a database or
file system or API or microservice these
are things that can be interacted with
so let's go through what npm is so npm
itself stands for the node package
manager
no great shakes there as the name says
it's responsible for all the packages
and modules that are bundled Within
node.js
so the notepad manager itself really has
two key functionalities now the first is
that a reply it is a central repository
for all packages and modules which you
can then search through um online you
can go to
search.nodejs.org and you can find all
of the packages of modules that are out
there the second is that it's also a
command line or terminal uh line utility
that allows you to install those
packages so you can actually go through
and you can see the version management
and dependencies within those packages
and you actually can control the
packages themselves
so why would you use npm
so npm is really useful for being able
to extend the project you're working on
so when you're building out a project
one of the concepts I like to use is the
concept of Lego bricks
um big fan of Lego and uh what's great
about Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality but if you
actually get a whole collection of Lego
bricks together you can build like crazy
cool things so think of when you're
working with the node package manager
itself is that each of those individual
pieces that you're working with each of
those individual packages are their own
Lego bricks and by themselves you can
then edit and update and maintain that
piece separately from the whole
environment as long as your inputs and
outputs you know really the piece where
you snap the logo in or when you connect
the Lego to something else are
interacted and open and well documented
then you can actually then use those
modules effectively throughout your
project
um so you can actually then be able to
do that you can do Version Control on
your codes and dependencies you can do
testing very easily
and then once you actually get to the
point where you go yes I want to release
um a new module you can do that
effectively using npm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for you
so let's go through the npm installation
so the actual package manager itself is
included with the installation of
node.js so if you've installed and
you're running node.js locally then
you've already installed the package
manager but you can also access it
through command line or terminal window
on your data server or in your server or
via the cloud
if you haven't now downloaded node.js
here's the website where you can go down
to install it and there's Windows and
Mac versions of that code as well with
the installers which allow you to get up
and going very quickly
you want to be able to run the installer
and accept all the default settings just
you know to begin with you want to kind
of have the standard set up so that you
are most familiar with the normal
settings before you start getting to the
point where you're a master and you're
tweaking things
there is a way that you can open up the
command window or The Terminal window
and once you've actually installed
node.js to verify that it's actually
installed you can write the command node
dash dash version and they'll actually
then pull out the version of node.js
that you have installed and then you'll
be able to see that you've got it
actually up and running
and then you can also do the same thing
for npm where you can do npm dash dash
version and actually will then show you
which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take it full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now so we're actually going
to go ahead and actually run a demo of
using npm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window where I'll be doing all
of my instructions then I also have a
folder which shows where I'll be putting
all of the files and then finally I'll
actually have a text editor in this case
I'm using vs code because it's free but
you can use any text edit you like to be
able to go in and show what the code
that's been created by npm in the Json
file so you can actually see what it
looks like and then we'll modify it a
little bit so first thing we want to do
is we want to go ahead and create a new
project file so I'm going to go in I'm
just going to move into let's do change
directory I'm going to the project
folder and we'll see down here that we
have an empty project folder but for
this one I'm actually going to go ahead
and I'm going to create a new directory
in this one and I'm going to call this
one simply learn
and there we are we've created a new
simply lamp folder
and we are going to move into the
symphony land folder
and so we're now in the simply land
folder uh there's nothing in there right
now um so the first thing we want to do
is we want to take go ahead and
initialize this folder as a project
folder for working with npm now to do
this you will have to have already
installed npm if you have node.js npm
comes with it and if you want to see
whether or not you have npm installed so
you can just do npm
version
and that will actually tell you what the
version of npm you have installed is it
also verifies that npm is installed so
I've gone ahead and I've been able to
validate that I have npm installed so
what I'm now going to go ahead and do is
I'm going to initialize this folder so
to do that just do npm in it and you'll
see that the path is that we're already
in the simply learn folder and then when
you do that
it's going to ask you some questions so
what is the package name we're going to
go with the defaults for right now and
then I can show you how we can edit
those in a little bit uh we're going to
go with just say yes to all of these
just by hitting return
and you'll see here that we're going to
create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do you want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our
folder here that we actually have
package.json so if we go ahead and open
this up with
vs code here we are we can actually see
what all the information is we can go
ahead and we can actually go and update
this metadata if we want to I'm going to
leave it as is for right now because I
want to show you a couple of other
things so a lot of times when you're
actually working with npm and the reason
why you're using npm is that you want to
take advantage of packages that are
freely available in the open source
community that are supported by node.js
and one of those is a package called
Express and express is a lightweight
framework for building out web
applications similar concept to angular
or react.js I like using it and it's
also a great way to be able to show how
we can install this using npm so to
install this and you just start with the
command npm and then you type in store
and then we type the name of the package
and we hit
enter and it goes ahead and what you'll
actually see
is a couple of things one is we have a
dependency in our package above we also
have so this is in our Json package that
it's now dependency it's written in
there we can also go in and under our
node modules we actually see that we
have let me scroll down we should see
Express
there it is Express
now if we decide that we don't want to
use um Express we can actually just come
in and we can write command npm
uninstall
type
Express
oops did a typo there so let's try that
again npm
uninstall
Express
and couple things can happen one is in
our Json file the dependency for the
express file has now been removed
and we can also see that underarm node
modules there are no extensions there
so this is kind of cool this allows us
to be able to see
um that we can easily add and remove
packages so let's just go ahead and I'm
going to install Express again so
installed
Enterprise
npm install Express
all right so it's gone ahead and it's
installed Express
now one of the things that often happen
is that when you're working with a
package the actual Json package so
you'll receive this file and you want to
be able to go ahead and install of the
sub modules that come with it so and you
can go through and you can manually
install them like this or you can
actually run and install command so you
can actually install all of them at once
I could just show you what that looks
like
because we're going to actually go ahead
and simulate as if we're going to
install bootstrap
which is another
popular framework
straight
and we're actually going to go with
and then we'll save that
and what we'll see is under the packages
that bootstrap isn't listed in there we
do have Express there it is right there
so we now come over to our new command
so we can actually write the command
npm install
and now
site typo let's try that again
let's do npm
install
okay it does help to save your file so
let's go ahead and let's run npm install
and when you do that what we'll now
actually have is not just
Express but we'll also see that
bootstrap has also been added
now I don't recommend that you use the
star symbol which will install the
latest version of bootstrap because you
obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of of what's happened here
now if we want to we can actually go in
here and we can see on in
install
bootstrap
and it will actually remove that from
your Json package so there we are that's
how you work with using npm from getting
started with a setup for a base
initialization of your package going
through to creating the first package
being able to set up and control the
naming convention for each of the items
within the metadata that provides the
instructions for the package how you
then put in dependencies such as Express
and bootstrap how you can install them
and remove them and actually use do all
of this through command line if you have
any questions please let us know
so let's kind of jump into the
express.js framework
so express.js is a really flexible
node.js and web application framework it
is just something you can spin up very
quickly and build both web and mobile
applications just a really great tool um
you know I use it all the time for
building up my own applications
the thing that's so great about it is
it's really simple and so it's not going
to be as have all the the functionality
that you'd have in maybe a larger scale
HTTP service but with that said it does
come with a lot of functionality that
allows you to not only create websites
but you can also do apis and other
routing calls very very nice
so let's go through some of the features
that expressjs have
so as I mentioned before it allows you
to build simple web applications and
that can be either a single page
application or a multi-page application
it also allows you to do middleware
requests and responses so for instance
if you want to do an API and have that
be part of your middleware you can
actually set that up real quickly in
fact in the demo that we'll do later on
we'll actually be building out four
different API calls that you'll be able
to do and you'll be able to see how you
can use express.js for that and that in
then turns allows you to be able to see
how express.js can help manage some of
the routing of the different HTTP
methods and that you'd be using via URL
and then finally it's just a great way
of being able to dynamically test the
work that you are developing so you can
actually build out a solution and test
it right away and express.js have it in
a single packet and then once you get to
a certain point you can then check in
the whole packet and even have it as
part of your container and then check
that into your main project and then if
somebody else wants to then take on the
work they can then just pull that in so
let's kind of go step through a you know
a basic example so here we actually have
a full script for creating a simple
hello world and this includes installing
express.js defining the ports it's going
to run on as well as a basic piece of
code so the first thing you want to do
is actually go ahead and Define how you
want to install express.js and this is
called the very first variable which is
requiring that Express be installed as
part of node packet manager npm will
then pull in the latest version of
Express if you needed to find a specific
version of course you can do that in
this example we're just going to pull
the latest one and then we'll go ahead
and with the second line which will then
install Express and when you do it once
you'll see how quickly it stores onto
your local development machine
the next parameters are actually a
callback function so if something
actually happens when you go to the
website where we're going to run our web
application you want something to pop up
and in this instance we'll say hello
world will pop up
the third block is all about where you
would actually go ahead and host your
code and so in this one you'll see that
the server is going to listen and listen
to Port 8081 so that's what that
functionality there defines
and then you can either put in the
specific host address in the demo you'll
actually see how we Define that for
localhost but you can actually then
point this to a production host
environment if you want
and then the final line here is a
command that actually sent a script to
your terminal window telling you that
which port and which host that you are
listening to so let's see what that
would look like so here we're going to
see how our terminal window and we're
actually able to then run the hello
world JS script that we just wrote and
then once we do that it'll actually then
post that we have an example app
listening ads and here we don't have a
web domain address and we do have the
port 8081
and in our browse window it says hello
world
so that's a quick breakdown of
express.js now let's jump over and do a
demo
so the first thing we want to do to get
Express up and running on our system is
we have to have node.json sword so we're
just going to do a Google search to let
you know where you can find node.js it's
actually at
nodejs.org so we select that link that
will take us to nodejs.org and there are
two types of downloads one is the
current download which has the latest
features and then there's a more stable
version that if you are new to node.js
I'd recommend you to download next we
want to find a text editor and we're
going to go with Visual Studio code or
vs code is known it's an open source
solution from Microsoft that runs across
all the leading platforms so this will
default to our Windows platform but you
can run it on Mac OS and Linux as well I
really like it it's a great code it
comes a lot of extensions and it's open
source
and next thing you want to do is because
we're going to be developing apis we
want a way to be able to visualize those
apis quickly and a great tool is a
product called Postman again open source
and so you can go out and go to
postman.com top right hand corner you'll
see a bright orange download button
where you can actually go and head and
download and install Postman and that
will allow you to be able to access all
of your apis that we're going to be
creating in Express
you can actually use other tools such as
apigee as well for visualizing your apis
but this one's just great to get you
started so let's go ahead and open up vs
code and we want to go ahead and open a
new folder where we're going to have our
project we're going to just for our
demonstration here we're going to put
this on the desktop you wouldn't
normally do this but it will work fine
here and we're going to create a folder
we're going to title the file the node
Express and we'll select that folder
that now becomes the root folder for our
project in Visual Studio we don't really
need the the welcome screen anymore so
we're going to get rid of that
and one of the things that is great
about working with vs code is you can
actually have the terminal window up and
running as well so let's go ahead and
open that so it's running at the bottom
of our screen and this gives us a little
bit of space
and the first thing we want to do is
actually turn convert the folder we're
in actually into a project running
node.js so we're going to use npm init
and they'll actually initialize the
project we have another video that
explains how to use npm or node package
manager and you can go ahead and find
that um in our library here but as we go
ahead and we do that you'll actually see
that it will create the default package
Json file which has the name of the
folder is the default name of the
package but you can actually go in and
edit any of these documents
we want to create a default file as
called index.js
this is where we're going to write most
of our scripts that allow us to work
with node.js
and the first is writing a script that
allows us to install Express and we'll
use the node packet manager to actually
pull and install Express and you can
fault to specific versions of Express if
you want and we're just going to go with
the latest one so we're just going to
put in Express and then we'll go down
into terminal window and say npm install
Dash save Express and this will install
Express so we can actually test out the
code we're working on
and this will be just a moment to
install
great thing we're working with node
package manager is that once we've
finished with our package here we can
actually wrap it all up and send it over
to any other developer that we're
working with and then you can actually
run the the package and actually have
exactly the same code installed
and there we are we have everything
installed and ready to go
we can see we actually have all of the
modules installed you'll see that we
actually have Express installed as well
and we also want to then make this an
app
and then we'll do app listen
to Ports 3000 so this is by default
we're going to be running from our Local
Host which is uh HTV server running on
this test machine and we're going to
have Express for this project run on
Port 3000.
and in the once we actually run the
script we'll actually post into the
console window a piece of text saying
service started on Port 3000
so we're going to go ahead and save this
file a little control s to save these
files
so let's go into localhost in our web
browser so localhost colon sorry again
localhost column 3000 and you'll see
nothing has been reached that's because
we actually haven't done anything to
initialize the script so we want to come
in and we're going to go node index.js
and hit return and as you can see now we
have a message in our console window
that means that yep there we go we
actually have everything up and running
so we can actually see that the service
is running not a very pleasant message
so let's go ahead and change that
so let's change that to
app get
and
acquire res
and so if you use the get message that's
change what will print and we'll type
hello there
exclamation mark
and we save that
and we refresh the screen
oh nothing happened again because we
didn't run the script so let's go back
in and we'll run the script node
index.js and now what you'll see is if
we refresh there we are we have our new
hello there message
all right well let's actually start
building some apis in this environment
so to be able to build the apis we want
to be able to pull content so we can
actually create a new file called
users.js and we're going to create
I'm going to go ahead and create a a
user's Json packet an adjacent packet is
essentially
a an array
um consider it like a small database and
in this array we're going to have four
objects each object is going to have
three pieces of metadata we have an ID
name and email and there'll be ID 1 2
and 3 and then you'll see that the names
will be John Smith and we'll make up a
couple of others I'm just kind of giving
them arbitrary email addresses
it's just for our demo here
let me grab this copy it and kind of
speed up
the script writing time
there we go
and let's just change what we need and
one of the things that's nice with
working with the visual studio code vs
code is there's lots of plugins and so
one of the default features is that if
you select a variable it'll actually
look for the same variable in the script
so you can if you need to you can
actually change them all in once
but we don't need to worry about that
right now we're just creating a Json
packet so we have four items
ID one two three and four for John Smith
and Jack and Chris
all right so that's our
erased string and we're going to then
make sure that we can export that as
users so we can actually now whenever we
select the term users in our scripts
you'll actually pull in this packet
all right looking good
now let's go over to our main index.js
file and we're actually going to go
ahead and we want to
like Store where the the API is going to
be so we're going to create a photocore
route and then a subfolder called API
and then we'll call a file in there
called users.js so as we're updating our
scripts we know where to
pull the data from
it's just a standard way of being able
to pull out the values so in here we're
going to say
um in this instance Express is required
for our Scripts
and we're going to also say that from
router
with an Express router
correct naming convention
and the script is case sensitive we'll
also want to create a value later on
that will have a unique ID so we're
actually going to pull in a uuid
package that will actually then allow us
to install unique identifiers so we use
node package manager to install uuid
again this is a great example of how you
can go from nothing to something very
quickly with Express
node.js because we've installed Express
we installed uuid and We're Off to the
Races
so let's have users require the path for
where our API is going to be located
all right so let's do a basic get which
will be to pull the record so we're
going to have it pull all the records so
router.get and we're going to require it
to pull all of the records in the Json
Packer that we created
so there should be four items to come
back
save that
looks good
make sure that users is consistent
there's our Json packet
and yep everything's looking pretty good
all right let's go back to index
and we're going to switch out this
function here from just a generic get
with a generic statement to actually
being able to pull in the users so
we have to go app
use express.json
no dot use
URL encoded
extended
false
amp dot use
API uses so
you're going to be pulling them off in
the same location
require
D and whether we have our API
Scripts
okay
and then let's go ahead and open up
Postman because we can actually use
Postman to actually show us what the
results look like because right now the
results won't show up appropriately
um in our browser window
so placement again is just a API
management tool if you used apogee or
other similar tools that are on the
market mulesoft
um you'll see it's very consistent again
this is open source and what you want to
be able to do is you can actually go and
actually go to the path where the API is
stored and then you can use all the
different types of commands within your
environment to be able to you know test
out the scripts so let's go ahead and
create a new project a new request and
we're going to go with the default get
but there's actually quite a lot of
different commands we can use
and these are just HTTP commands
and we're going to type in the request
and in this instance
it's going to be
let's run our script first
script
let's make sure we're exporting the data
correctly
okay so we want to run our script so
let's do a node.index.js and that will
run the changes that we just created so
we can now come over to get we select
API um localhost colon 3000
API uses when we do that brings back the
Json package with that for entry points
yeah there's all four of them
so that's your
first action
now let's kind of get this a little bit
tinier let's actually go in and see if
we can filter by ID
so we're going to go in and we're going
to modify our scripts it's going to be
around and then we're going to put in
the filter and in this instance it's
going to be ID
which would allow us to be able to just
put a backslash against the end of the
URL stream we just had and put in a
number or a unique identifier and then
that will actually then allow us to pull
in that unique record
foreign
[Music]
okay so it found
to
take the Json and
print it
so we're going to filter here against
user ID
and then publish the results
else if it doesn't work I might just
have a generic error message
we shouldn't see this though in the
demos we're creating this is just good
practice
to save that
and let's go ahead and rerun our node
index file against that folder
and now we can actually come in here and
we do backslash one and that will give
us just one record and we could change
that to 2 or 100 in this instance and if
it's 100
we'll just get a bad request error
message
there's two
all right
so that's get so we'll be able to pull
all the records we've been able to
filter against one specific record
against a specific parameter in this
instance it was ID so let's go ahead and
create a new user so that what we're
going to do for this is we're going to
use the post command from HTTP to
actually push and post data into the
data source the data sources our Json
packet which means that we'll have to
then push a new record into the Json
package using our array statements
because Jason's just essentially in an
array
and so we're gonna
post and when we do this we have to
create a unique ID so this is where we
have to reference the uid
I'm going to do a V4 unique ID
which will be
four groups of four so these 16
characters
and then
we'll have
name
and email will post
okay looks good
Okay so
if
new user
and then put dot name
and
new user dot email
and I'm going to return
the results
okay
and so he uses Dot
push so we posted which is a HTTP
statement and then pushing into the
the Json packet array
okay
okay that's looking good
all right so I think we're good
let's go ahead and rerun our script
node index.js
now allows us to do that so let's go
over to postman so we can actually
connect to the URL and we're going to
change the HTTP statement to post
and get rid of that we'll go back to
users now if we just do this nothing's
gonna happen so we actually have to go
in and we have to update the body
um this would be the content that would
be passed through and we're going to go
through with a raw
statement here
and we're gonna do Json is B
that's the packet we're sending so let's
go ahead and the records we wanted to
update we only have to update two which
is one is name and the second is email
we don't have to do an ID because we're
using uuid to generate an automatic one
for us
and we're going to create records for
Steph and her email address is Steph
gmail.com
yep looking good
okay so let's go ahead and send that
we sent it
and if we look at the bottom we actually
now see that we have five records so a
new one's been added we have our unique
ID at the top and then we have name and
email which are the ones that we just
created for Steph and staff at gmail.com
all right
so that's posting now the next thing you
want to do is to update a record so that
means we need to select an ID and then
be able to update the content and for
that we're going to use the HTTP put
command
so we'll use ID as our way to be able to
filter
and then we'll be able to update against
that filter
so construct found
equals users
and then
we'll have it going against
user's ID so we know how to get the
correct record and then pass the record
Bank
onto the screen so we know what we're
editing
so if
so I found
I want to update the user
and we're going to go ahead and pull
information from the body for what will
be updated
and for each
diffuser ID
and pass integer
okay
so this is our values to punch against
the ID
and in this instance we'll make sure
that we're obtaining the values of
username
so if we are updating user
and we're just updating the username we
want to
make sure that that's the value that
gets updated
and then we also want to do user email
we don't want to update the ID because
it's going to remain unique and
consistent
okay then we're going to make sure that
everything is pushed to the Json package
and then we'll also have a message
saying that
the field has been updated in the Json
package
okay
all right so we'll run that script again
and looks good so let's go to our folder
let's change the HTTP post let's put it
as get just so we can see that we have
all of their values in the array from
the Json packet
and now we want to say put which allows
us to update just one record
so let's go ahead and select one record
we'll save it1 so we have one record we
can go ahead and for name we can change
this
so let's go ahead and change these
so now you see that the email has
changed so we have staff
as the new account
all right our final API that we're going
to create is to delete an account and in
many ways it's actually a very basic API
because what we're doing is we're
grabbing the ID and then we're saying
that all the associated records with
that ID
within that row as it were in the table
just to delete the whole row
and so we want to use again our ID as
the unique value that we
pulling against
so we're going to if users are found and
we're going to
filter those users
I'm going to do that filter against user
ID
pass that
and
let go and
post a message to our Json packet saying
user deleted
and uh the generic message of things
fail
okay save that and we'll
so we'll go ahead and we're using we're
just deleting the record now
and we're going to do it by filtering
against the unique ID
and then you will then just eliminate
that record
and we'll pass the message that has been
the your account has been deleted
okay let's save that let's go run our
script
node index.js
good okay let's come over here and we're
going to
show that we can put any of the accounts
so let's just take one of them
one that's good
so let's go ahead and we're going to
change
the HTTP command to delete
and we actually have to
select an account so just do one when we
do that it'll actually delete that
record and here we are um it says that
the user has been deleted and we now
only have three records in the Json
packet
and we can pull all the records
and you'll see that there's only three
so being able to pull all the records
from a Json package we've been able to
create a record update a record and
delete a record
and we can just step through so here's
our Json package that we created
originally again this is just an array
it's just a different way of setting up
the array and then we have our index
files which um identifies what are the
apps that need to be installed and where
the API is going to be serviced out of
and that we're going to be doing this on
the ports 3000
again these are additional tools that we
need to make sure that we have up and
running in our script and so the first
script was to get all the the records
the second to filter against a user ID
for just a specific record and then for
creating a record we actually went in
and we used the uid tool to create a
unique identifier and then we posted in
the data for the new records we did
something similar with updating the
record we didn't have to update the user
ID we just had to update the values in
the two fields that we needed to be
updated
in this case name and email
and the final step was to go ahead and
delete a record so these are all apis
that you can now pull into your own
application so you can use them in web
applications or you can actually go
ahead and use them in other applications
such as mobile applications
local applications and other scripts and
this really allows your application to
become more scalable and more useful
hello and we're going to go through and
do a demo of building a restful API with
node.js so the first thing we want to do
is go ahead and install all the correct
pieces of software we're going to start
with node.js so let's do a Google search
on node.js and you'll find that node.js
is at
nodejs.org so we select that link
and that's going to take us to the
node.js website and there are two
versions of node.js you can download
There's the stable version and then
there's the latest version I'd go with
the stable version you'll find it
available in Windows Mac OS and Linux as
well
and if we go to the next piece of
software we want to go ahead and install
the text editor of your choice I'm going
to use Visual Studio code vs code it's
an open source solution it works on all
leading platforms uh works really well I
like the larger Microsoft did a good job
with this I also really like it that
it's open source but there's lots of
extensions you can get for vs code so
it's a great text editor and we'll also
need Postman Postman is a tool that
allows us to be able to view the apis
that we're going to create so let's go
ahead to postman.com and again it's
another solution you can download for
free and so we're going to go ahead and
select the download button and it will
automatically detect which OS you're on
so in this case this can be windows but
you can also get Mac and Linux as well
so we'll go ahead and download those
and once we have everything installed
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a project in vs code and that's
actually really easy to do all you have
to do is create a folder
and we'll do this right off our desktop
and we're going to call the folder node
rest API and we'll select that folder
and you'll see on the left hand column
that we have the new folder that we
created we still have the vs code
welcome screen we can get rid of that we
don't need that anymore
so let's go ahead and one of the things
I like with vs code is you can actually
toggle the terminal window so let's go
ahead and open up the terminal window so
we can actually run that at the same
time and so we're going to move our
cursor to the folder we just created and
there we are you can see that
and what we can do now is we're going to
initialize this with node package
manager to make this a package
and it's going to go ahead I'm going to
ask for a name we're just going to go
with the default so we're just going to
say yes yes to a couple of these yep
enter enter
[Music]
and is this okay
yep enter
all right so now we have a new file and
this is our Json package it has all the
defaults in it we can go in and modify
these if we want to no need to for this
exercise but you may want to for the
solution that you're putting together
and we're going to create a new file
called index.js and this is going to be
the reference file though it's in the
Json package for npm
and here we're going to put in our
solutions that we absolutely have to
have for this to run so we're going to
install Express and express is a web
service application but it's very
flexible and one of the things that
we're going to use it for today is build
apis
so in our terminal window we're going to
type npm install dash dash save Express
this will install Express locally on our
machine
and takes a few minutes but it's going
to go and download all the latest
features this is going to be the latest
version of Express you can if you want
to specify a specific version of
software for these examples there's no
need to do that
so you'll see that everything has been
installed and we expanded the node
module we can scroll down and indeed yep
there we are we see Express has been
installed along with some other pieces
that are used for
all right so that's our first piece and
the next
is we're going to Define our amp and our
app is going to use Express
and we want Express as a local host on
our local machine on Port 3000 so we've
identified Port 3000 as the default port
for our application
and
we are going to now create
a an array
for some movies
I'm going to have ID title director and
release date
exception great movie
and director Christopher Nolan
and I was released
in 2010 yes 10 years ago
okay so we're going to do an a couple of
items here and just so that we have some
more than one entry in our array and
array is a JavaScript uh you can think
of it as a very simple uh table now it
allows us to have structured data you
can also do a Json file you can also
connect to a database mongodb or
something like that
2019
okay so we have two movies in our little
array
would be more than enough right now
uh key part is that we have a consistent
structure for the array of IDE title
director and release date
and so we're going to create two apis
one's going to be a get API we'll get
the list of the items in our API and the
second will be a post where we'll be
actually pushing in a new item so let's
go ahead and start with the get and what
we want to do is we're going to select
get slash movie and
we are going to
have this run as an API and so what
we'll do is we will test this in a
moment so we'll be running from our web
browser and actually we'll probably open
up Postman and run it through Postman so
okay
that pulls all the movies
and we'll do a another
um get in a moment we'll filter by movie
ID but let's just get them all for right
now
and we are going to listen
on a server port in this instance it's
going to be important
and we already had to find the port as a
variable earlier and which so we're just
referencing the variable and the port
number is listed at the top in line four
it's just a text stream it's going to
get put to the terminal window
and it is going to dynamically
grab the port the value from the
variable from 3000
and place it in our text string easy
and we want to save the file
and now we're going to go ahead and run
it so we're going to do node index touch
Js
that runs the script
and it tells us that we're listing on
Port 3000 that's great
that means now that we should be able to
go into Postman
and
grab the data from an API
so here's Postman if you've not used it
before it's a great tool for being able
to manage apis strongly encourage you to
have a go with this so we're going to
get the get command and we've done any
applications web applications you've
probably used get and post for the data
and that your uh pulling and pushing
from forms online same principle so we
want to go ahead and we're going to go
and we'll grab get I'm going to type in
localhost
and it's going to be colon 3000 slash
movies because that's the the name of
the file and we're going to hit send and
what we get as a response
is the
data in our query
sorry in our array here we go so there's
our array and the data values have been
pulled back by Postman
that's great
so now we want to go ahead and add a
movie
to our array
and we're going to do that we're going
to use the post
command and it gets imposed our HTTP
commands
and so we're going to use movies
and in this instance we're going to push
the value
into
our list
so construction movie requires we're
going to need a structure here and that
structure is going to be
the information that's in the the body
and then we're going to push to the log
our terminal window
and I'm going to push so here we're
using push and that's a term in for
arrays within JavaScript where we push
the data into the actual array itself
there are lots of ways of being able to
control data within an array if you're
new to arrays with JavaScript I strongly
encourage you to learn more about them
there's just an awful lot you can do
with them
and then we want to have a validation
message come up on the screen saying yes
movie has been added to the list so
we'll save what we've just created
and video save it won't show up and then
we're going to re-run
the node index.js file
you can see this is what we've created
here already
a an API that allows us to pull and push
data
in and out of a variable
okay so let's go back and we're going to
change the header from being get to
being push
so we're going to use sorry not push our
post so I'm going to say post and then
what we want to do is the value inside
of the body and so let's go pose huh
and we want to select a body
and we're going to put in text
and select Json so it's going to be
structured and so here we will
essentially copy the structure we have
here so let's go ahead and just
copy these elements
and we have to give it an ID because we
don't have an auto generated ID so we're
going to make this ID
3.
and then
and it's going to be a number three
and then we want to put in
title
a new movie and we'll put in director
and we'll have this as
I don't know new director
not very creative here today
and then
we need to put in a date
so release underscore dates
and let's just put in
a date
today
um just so you know that we're not
formatting the date con it's
so let's go ahead and we'll select send
and this will actually go and we can see
below boom movies being added to our
list
and we can go back and let's go ahead
and validate that so we're going to
change from post to get
use the same
and now we go to the low
oh looks like we put an arrow in
our formatting
so let's go
to
pass the Json
and we'll pass it using Express
and this will
clear up any formatting issues
so
app.use Express Json
Express
URL encoded
extended false
and that should help us pass
value
and then we'll rerun that script make
sure you save the previous file
otherwise it won't run the new script
all right okay so let's go back
and
let's go back to our
localhost 3000 slash movies
and there's only two values here so what
we need to do now is change from get to
post we'll go to body
and what we're going to do is we want to
have
raw Json and
what we want to do is capture the values
that we have below
and insert
this
file into this new
Json packet
into our array
you can actually just copy that
it's a little bit cheating but it's the
main same so let's go ahead and
get everything consistent
and we'll change the number to three
and create a unique title patching sorry
new typo doesn't need to be unique just
the ID needs to be unique
so title new movie new director and
change it to New director
and we'll change the date
I'm not doing any formatting on the
dates you can hear me any date any
number really
hit save
movies being added to our list so it's
been added but now let's go back to get
and let's see if we can actually see the
third entry and scroll down and there we
are we've actually pushed that Json
package into our array
so we now have three items in and
they're hoping added fire our API
okay
so
now let's go ahead and search our Movie
Database I guess we only have three
entries but you know we want to be able
to so we can do that by using the get
command and what we'll be doing is we'll
be validating against
a specific ID number so we have three
and we're going to
validate against just the ID number
um in this instance
um the way to do it is through the URL
so beforehand we have localhost colon
3000 slash movie now we're adding in uh
Slash movie slash and then whatever
number of that will actually filter
against the ID and
that's essentially what we're doing here
right now
so we're going to go into f movies
dot ID again we're using the ID menu to
actually pull from our arraylist
with my variables and arrays mixed up
here today
and then once we actually have the value
we'll actually post back as a Json
packet
and if we have any errors then what
we'll do is we'll throw up a message
maybe not found so there we are we're
going to plug in some ID
and we should be able to then pull that
up through Postman into our terminal
window
again the reason why we're using Postman
is that this is actually just showing
the values going back and forth we're
not having to render a whole web page uh
it's extremely fast very efficient
all right
so we saved and rerun our script all
right let's go back and what we're going
to do is we're going to change the value
so we're going to hit send here we are
we see all of our movies using the get
command now what we're going to do is
we're going to use a look filtering just
id2 which is the Irishman so to slash
two and there we are we have just the
information on the Irishman so now you
can see how you can create a simple
search
all right
so the final action we want to do is to
delete a record
in our array and so we can go ahead and
do that
and we're going to use the uh Delete
commands to actually do that so we'll be
able to push
um in a record we've been able to view
records filtered guy against records now
we're going to go ahead and do delete
and so we can do app delete and then
we're going to filter by specific ID
number
and when we do this we'll actually then
we'll be put in the URL path which will
be localhost colon 3000 slash movie
slash and then the ID number so this is
inside that 102 probably use two that
will then
delete from our array
the record for the Irishman
files
I do the shortcut and the keyboard
shortcut of Control Plus s to save files
on Windows or command plus F and my Mac
and
once we've deleted a record we want to
send a message saying that B movie has
been deleted
all right so we want to go ahead
and let's just check our code looking
good save our file
and we want to rerun
the index.js file
yep
rerun okay let's go to postman
Instagram
the delete
so again we're filtering against the
movie ID and then we'll delete that ID
okay so we went against the Ashman and
we hit send
and there it is now we're going to
change
the command to delete
so we hit
one we'll actually delete conception the
movie has been deleted it's great and
now let's go ahead and grab uh use get
to pull in all the movies that are
listed and it's not going to find movie
number with the id1 it's not there
anymore
and if we get all the movies
we see we only have one movie and that's
the Irish one and so our delete function
has worked
there we are so we've installed Express
we're using Express to build all of our
applications we have our app running on
Port 3000 we are using Express to pass
the Json effectively back and forth we
have a simple array that array is then
being used to create an API to pull the
details then we're being able to add a
movie then search for a movie yeah it's
filtering against an ID
and then we can actually finally go
ahead and delete a movie
all this using express.js
today we're going to be covering node.js
authentication using JWT or Json web
tokens so let's get started so why are
we going to go down this path so let's
cover the key things that you need to be
asking yourself such as what is a Json
web token what is the value of using a
Json web token then what is the actual
structure of the GWT look like and then
let's go through some use cases of where
you'd actually use jwts both in the
Enterprise and in the real world
and then finally we're actually going to
go through a demo on how you can
actually install a JWT and using Express
and node.js
so let's dive into what actually is a
Json web token
so a Json web token is actually based on
an open standard it's one that you can
actually go ahead and research and it
allows a definition of a compact
self-contained way of being able to
securely transmit information between
parties using adjacent object an
adjacent object is a JavaScript array
and it's very compact it's a very a
tight way of being able to send data
back and forth
the thing that's great about using a
Json web token is that the information
itself is encrypted and it can only be
verified and trusted through a public
private key pair and we'll get into that
about how you can actually get to those
so you know why would you actually want
to go ahead and use a Json web token are
there other formats that you can use
well yes there are other formats you can
use but what's great about a JWT is that
it is a great way to be able to pass
data from a HTTP servers so if you're
building a web application and you have
a web vacation where you need to pass
authentication over using a jw2 is a
great way to be able to do that so for
instance you may have a number of
Enterprise applications that run across
your Cloud environment you may have some
Enterprise applications that run in your
data center and you want to have people
come in such as your employees or your
customers authenticate once and then be
able to have their ID transition from
one to the next and JWT is a great way
to do that the content is extremely
secure and we'll get more into that in a
moment but it is the highest level of
security you can have right now
and the final great thing about working
with JWT is that the actual tokens
themselves are very well documented and
so there's actually a lot of passes that
you can use so being able to add in JWT
into your application is very very easy
to do which makes it very easy for you
to actually Implement and a large scale
authentication and authorization and so
authorization is a key word there that's
something that you're probably coming
across um a lot instead of just being
able to identify who you are we want to
be able to authorize what you have
access to
so let's have a look at the structure of
a JWT there are several key armors and
the first is the header and that's
actually going to break down what I kind
of token It Is by default it's going to
be a GWT token and what is the signing
algorithm so sha512 is a very complex
and secure algorithm and certainly the
one that I would recommend that you use
and you can even go higher than that but
um sha512 is a great place to start
and then you have the payload and the
payload is the information that's been
actually encrypted within the web token
so in this instance we have a name the
admin time type sub name
um just really you can put whatever kind
of information you want in there as long
as it's applicable to the uh service
that you're passing the data into
and then you have your signature which
is
um encoded header um and payload with
the algorithm that you've sent so in
this instance it's sha512 algorithm
so let's look at some of the use cases
that you'd have for JWT
so a couple of use cases would be
authorization so say for instance you
have a application and you want to be
able to authorize somebody to have
access to different parts of that
application
um JWT is a great way to be able to
encrypt that data and be able to pass
that data back and forth examples would
be jumping from different parts Office
365 and be able to have access to
different features within the system
and then another area would be if you're
doing information exchange so
information is being securely exchanged
from one person to another so a
blockchain scenario a multi distributed
environment where you want to be able to
have a way to be able to securely
transmit data back and forth and know
that that data is being encrypted is
another good example
so with that let's take a pivot and
we'll go ahead and we'll look at
creating a demo using our standard stack
of node.js and we'll use express and
Postman and these are tools that you may
already be familiar with if you've seen
other videos that we've created in this
series and we'll go ahead and create a
JWT token
so let's go into our demo of how to
create a JWT Json web token there's
going to be some tools that we need to
get started with node.js is the first so
let's go ahead and find node.js at
nodejs.org and you can either download
Windows Mac or Linux code
obviously you'd install the one that
would be for your operating system and
the next tool that we want to install is
a text editor we're going to use Visual
Studio code or vs code and go to
code.visualstudio.com download this this
will run on Mac windows and Linux really
great text code editor
and then we're also going to use Postman
Postman is a tool that allows you to
access and view apis that will be
creating with Express and you go to
postman.com hit download and again
there's versions of Postman for all
leading operating systems
and have those installed and up and
running
so we're going to go ahead and let's
open up visual studio code
I'm going to start by creating our
project
so let's go full screen on this get rid
of the welcome screen
and that's going to open up a folder
where we'll actually have our project
I'm going to put this on our desktop for
right now let's go create a new folder
and we'll call this node JWT
[Music]
uh Json web token select that folder
and we're going to want to go ahead and
use npm to initialize this folder for
for node and so let's get rid of the
welcome screen again and let's go ahead
and one of the things I love about vs
code is you can actually run the
terminal window right from in here so
let's go ahead and select npm init
Arenas to pull from the folder that
we're in and we're just going to select
yes here in a second for
um
yep let's go ahead and create that and
you'll see that the packet has been
created and there is a Json packet with
just default information about the npm
package that we created for node and
we're going to go ahead and create an
index.js file that's what we'll be
pulling from the package and the
index.js files we're going to actually
write all of our code and what we want
to do right now is install Express
and express is going to be used to
create the apis that will be able to
test our JWT against and then we'll also
want to install
a JWT
file so let's call this Json web token
and from our terminal window we'll just
go ahead and install both of those and
do that by typing npm install
save and then we're going to put Express
and Json web token
Express and Json web token
and we'll just go ahead and let those
install
it only takes a moment for those to get
installed
all right we're up and running okay
so let's go ahead and start bringing in
some of our apps so we're going to
create an Express amp
and we're going to use the
get HTTP header to have everything go
from the we're going to actually have
everything running on our local host and
we're going to run everything off Port
3000 we'll do that in a moment here but
we'll have everything running off a sub
folder called apis where our web
applications can be running from
and we'll put in a message that hey
there to show that everything's up and
running
okay
and
save that
and say if you can do Control Plus s to
save your files and as you can with a
lot of Windows applications and I
encourage you to do that a lot so let's
go ahead and open up Postman we don't
even go to our web browser on this one
and open up Postman
takes a moment to run the first time
and it comes
and Postman again is a tool for being
able to manage API calls and
so you don't have to write a script
so here we go
and we can go in here and we can
that's where we're going to write our
script but we have to
do a couple things first let's let's get
everything running so we want to listen
on for Port 3000 that's we're going to
run everything off of
and in the console log we'll actually
throw in a message to confirm that we
are running on uh everything is up and
running we'll just say Okay server
started on Port 3000 again we're going
to be running everything off localhost
so you'll be able to see this
um and this is as you imagine just a
test environment so let's go down into
our console we'll run this script node
index.js to run the script runs really
fast not a whole lot going on there and
we're having everything running off the
API file so let's go and we'll type in
under our get localhost
colon 3000
API
and then we hit the there's lots of
different HTTP headers um we can use
we're going to use get for right now
send that
and
hey there welcome to the API service
so typically this is just an API we're
creating right now this is not JWT we'll
get into that right now
all right
so we want to be able to post data
and post is actually pushing data in so
we're going to go into I'm going to
create a login screen again again this
is all API so it's not real but uh
you're good you get the point
and then you can construct a user
and let's go ahead and what we're doing
here is we're creating a
an array of a random user and that they
can have a name of id1 that they have
users can have ID value which is one
um a username value which is going to be
John and then email value of John
gmail.com
and then we'll make this a
Json web token JWT signing and they'll
have to sign with their user
and this is going to use a secret key
which will be our hash
512 token
and
respond to the Json with the token
okay so let's see now okay we're going
to
amp Dot and this will be our post
API
posts
and what we're going to be able to do is
we're going to jump from one app to
another app and you'll be able to see
how we can move the token with it
this is
and the message will read
post
created
all right
so let's just run that script next.js
runs real quick okay
so if we come over here and we go to
posts
and hit send
and say message posts created
good
so let's go ahead and try that again
and we want to go to the
login
so we'll go from one app to another app
set post
and here is the login
we should be able to request the token
this will be our GWT token
when we hit send we should get our token
and here you can see the the whole token
is encrypted
and set huge long line
it's very unique
and
now we want to be able to go in and say
okay let's verify
the token so we've gone ahead and we
created the token but now we need to as
you go from app to app we need to
actually verify the token so we're going
to get an error message if we don't
verify the token correctly
so I'm going to put in a function to
verify the token
and
we're going to create a better header
value
which will be
the headers and the authorization for
that
and if type of error header
I'm gonna either have it if it's not
correct it'll be undefined
otherwise the spirit token
it will be split
and we're going to require the token
for our Bearer token
else
since status
403 okay so Bearer token is what we're
going to be calling against to verify
our token I'll show you how that works
in just a moment
and this will be to authorize
and to authorize we'll need to actually
go ahead and
use the token so we can actually
put in here
all right so I think
everything's looking pretty good
oh and
if things if we get the error message
means that it's we'll see the message
forbidden if we don't put in the code
correctly so it's
double check everything is looking good
we can verifying that we took is
required
okay
so if it is then JWT dot foreign
and this will
connect our token appropriately
and we'll be able to
put that in as a part of our secret key
and if it is successful
we'll put in
that message there
and we're also going to plan the
authorization data
yep looking good
as you can see a lot of the work is just
making sure that everything is aligned
up correctly
okay so let's run our code node index.js
there we go nice and fast
and
we go in and localhost
API posts and change this to post
so this one API which is the API posts
which is up here
I'm going to hit send
now you can see that we have the error
code submittent has come up which is
what we were expecting because we
haven't been able to put in a secret key
and put in the comment there forbidden
so it's as we're stepping through the
code
but now what we can actually do is we
can go back and we can grab the token
and here is our token below and we just
want the token so we don't need the
wrappers
and copy that
come over here
and we write again it's going to say
forbidden but if we go into author into
uh headers we can put in authorization
and then the value
we do Bearer and then the key
and once we do this
we now get all of the data that we were
asking for pull back
which is exactly what we wanted
so you can see here how we can actually
securely use a JWT to pass values back
and forth across the application
okay
and we hit authorization review select
that and prove it yep we keep
authorizing so if you don't authorized
and you don't get the data
okay so we have everything against the
API then we have one application which
equal to API post we have another
application called API plugin and we're
able to move the data back and forth
using our secret key in our JWT token
and we have everything running on for
3000 of our Local Host server
and that's our demo
so first of all let's cover why you'd
want to go through this tutorial so
we're going to cover what my sequel is
we're also going to tell you how we're
going to connect with node.js and why
you'd want to do that with my SQL and
then finally we're going to do a demo
taking you through all the steps on how
you can actually do that kind of
connection
so what is my SQL well basically my
sequel is probably the world's most
popular relational database so if you
think of relational databases that are
table driven MySQL is arguably the most
popular database out there for rdbs
systems it is by far the most popular
open source relational database
the entire database is written in C and
C plus plus it's been around for a
really long time and again it's open
source which is great which means that
there are no licenses or costs for
actually using MySQL and you'll find
that companies of all sizes from small
mom and pop shops all the way up to
massive Enterprise Global Enterprises
are all using MySQL so yeah why would
you want to then take that next step of
connecting node.js with my SQL what
fundamentally comes down to the basics
of the differences between the two
products MySQL is a database and node.js
is a architecture framework for building
out web applications again with mySQL
it's open source it's free to use you
don't have to pay anything there are no
licenses which if you compare it with
other Solutions out there is a big deal
my sequel even though it is open source
it's incredibly powerful it's one of the
more mature open source programs out
there I think Apache is probably
arguably more patchy uh web server is
probably more mature but uh my sequel is
very close behind it so it has had a
huge amount of investment this is not a
solution that's only a couple years old
we're talking about a solution that's
more than 15 years old very very
structured very powerful and you can do
a lot of really good things with it
um you can actually then build Solutions
with it and using PHP Java really any
kind of database even other systems and
other Frameworks will allow you to
interact with mySQL and it just allows
you to work with just huge amounts of
data very very quickly
so let's go through a demo of how you'd
actually use node.js and MySQL
so I'm going to go ahead and we're going
to get
environment together so let's start by
stepping node.js and downloading it so
we'll get to knowjs.org
and there you have your options for
Windows Mac or if you want to go for the
source code you can go ahead and
download and install that
the next is to install Zam and so we're
going to go to zap installers for a
quick search and that's on our Apache
friends.org site and here we have
example available for Windows Linux and
Mac OS 10.
and then finally we want to go ahead
and install visual studio so visual
studio is going to be our idea
integrated development environment in
this instance we're going to use Visual
Studio code if you're not used for your
student code it's a break free open
source solution for being able to build
applications I'm a big fan of it so I
encourage you to use it
and go ahead and download install that
and we have visual studio and code up
and running so go ahead and we're going
to open up a new folder and let's go
ahead and create a new folder and just
put it straight five desktop here and
it's Just for kicks and Giggles so we're
going to type in node MySQL or our
source code and open up that folder and
select that
and so we now have this folder selected
in uh Visual Studio code editor and what
we want to do is we want to get rid of
the welcome page and we don't really
need that anymore and we're going to
turn a window so we can actually see the
script that we're writing we're going to
be using terminal quite a bit
um in this so for instance we're just
going to test that we have npm installed
we do so that's great
and we're going to go to npm init and
that's actually going to set up our own
node package module and we can actually
see that the Json file for the package
has been created so we go in there we
can see that all the defaults selected
now you'll see that index.js is the
default file that will be created so
we're actually going to go ahead and
we're actually going to create our own
index.js file and we're going to add in
some instructions into that file to
actually install the correct software
from the npn package
and the first thing we want to do is
install Express
which is a package that's great for
building a lightweight web applications
not mobile applications I suppose if
you're doing a responsive design then I
guess
level but in this it's really it's a web
application environment so we're going
to put in the requirements for that and
then we're going to also go and require
that my SQL gets installed
and uh you'll see that for both of them
we're just going to use npms default
commands for creating it and we'll go
down to the channel window and we'll do
npm install and it's going to install
the express and my SQL environment
and asset in stores you actually see on
the left hand side under the folder you
actually see
the files starting to be installed so
for instance we have the node modules
and underneath that will be all the
subsequent files that we need
and there we are everything is installed
all right so let's go ahead and validate
some of these commands make sure
everything is installed so we're going
to open up xampp which allows us to go
in and
View and see everything installed so we
have my SQL Server we have a patch
installed we can start to stop and the
services
with zamp go ahead and do that you can
do this through tell the window as well
but
the UI interface is really nice so let's
go into
my SQL interface
and you'll see that we don't have any
databases
these are all just the the standard test
databases and so we have to go ahead and
create one
and so that's
get our
SQL database connection created
so I'm going to write const DB equals
MySQL
create connection
and we want to create connect to the
localhost in this instance
and users just going to be a root user
account
which is the standard user account that
comes from MySQL there is no password
for the root user when you're running it
locally or I encourage you to change
that as quickly as you can because you
don't really want to have a password
free environment
and now we want to be able to then
connect to the MySQL
environment
so do Royal write DB dot connect
uh parentheses error and we want to
throw it in error message if the
connection isn't good so if we do error
we will throw the
error message to the log window
and if we don't
they will write my super connected
and then we want to connect that to our
Express app
the next step we want to do after we
read our connection is to go ahead and
create a database so I'm going to do
both steps are the same one so we'll run
the script right now and then we'll run
the commands in the terminal window so
we can actually create the database
and so we're going to go ahead and we
want to create
a database
and let's
let's let SQL equals
create
database
I'm going to call the database node
MySQL you could call it whatever you
want
um this is just a node MySQL
script
put DP
query
SQL
error
through error message
rest.send
database created
so we'll throw a message saying that
database has been created I'm just going
to save that
to demonstrate that we've connected and
we've created database so let's go ahead
and the node index.js
let's run it and we connect it to my SQL
that's great
good first step and then we'll go to the
window
and we'll go to localhost
3000 which is
the default
connection but what you'll see is that
we've actually created the name of the
database system change to node by SQL so
we've got an error message which we
expected and so what we're going to do
is we're actually going to go ahead and
[Music]
we're going to say we want to listen
and if the error message it comes out to
three thousand
name
in the console window we want to
put a message of server started on
course 2000.
so let's try that again
load index.js
yep and server has signed in 43 000.
Let me refresh that
I'm still getting an error message
and what we want to see is let's go
ahead and see how database hasn't been
created
so let's go and connect to
database
database let's go ahead and click
create DB on Port 3000 all right so by
doing that we write that command and
that function and that goes and creates
our database and we'll let you see that
we have now node MySQL has been created
great first start
now we have to go in and create some
tables because we have no tables in
there
all right so let's go down let's go
ahead and create a table
so what you're seeing right now is that
we're using
the index.js environment within a
package on node.js to actually create
and control everything that we want to
see in our windows so all of the work
that we're doing for creating a table
for creating the database
for initializing the core files it's all
being done through Js and so here we are
going to create a new table we call it
created it's going to be called the
employee table and so once we run the
command create complete it's going to
create a table has the employee fields
which is going to have an ID which will
be an integer there or into a quarter
increment it'll have a name field
and we'll also put in a designation
field
and
I will have a primary key as well
keep it very simple for right now
and let's just
put our DB connection so that everything
connects effectively
okay so the information is correctly
then we'll have the message employee
table created
so let's test this out
and note total index.js
make sure that the data we have now
actually a database field that we can
connect to so we've got node my SQL so
we're connecting to the correct database
obviously we get an error
and then we'll try that again okay
thanks to database so database has the
name
and of course we've got load MySQL
there's no fields in there yet so let's
go ahead and
and putting trade employees or fields
and let's run the budget that you create
this new table
and then
voila we have a new table and so the
next action we want to do is actually
populate the table with a record
so this starts becoming familiar so
whenever to
put in a single record we'll call it
employee one for right now and
we'll write the
the function
uh employee one and when we run that
function
it'll actually go ahead and
create the it'll actually insert the
record into my SQL
and then the name will be Jake Smith
and the designation will be
a chief executive officer
certainly encourage you to put your own
self name your own name into this make
yourself your own CEO because why not
and we're going to make this as an
insert record
we're insert into the employee table
I'm just using some basic SQL script in
here
and what you'll see actually with Visual
Studio code is that it's actually
providing a lot of prompts to make it
easier to write your code
Microsoft is looking to actually add
some AI
to visual studio code to actually start
Auto completing scripts which will make
it even easier
to write your code
right so let's go run node index.js
we've seen guy from connected and we'll
grab the function employee one and let's
go over to our Express site
let's just go and we'll insert the
command employee E1
employee has been added and we will just
finally take this by going back to my
SQL and we'll refresh it and you'll see
if we click on the employee table which
we should now have an employee in there
yep there we did Jake Smith
hold on Jake first record
all right so you want to be able to now
is select the employee
so let's go ahead and do that
and we want to be able to easily get the
employee list
so let's use our SQL command and we'll
do slave star which is everything from
the employee table so we're actually
playing everything from the employee
table
I'm going to query the database
let's throw a message to confirm that
the query is successful
we'll put everything in the console log
results
you're ready let's give this a well
okay so let's go and run our Command
or localhost 3000
but get employee
and it says employee details fashion now
we go over to the console window in the
visual studio yep there we are we have
now all the packet information including
the ID about Jake Smith
okay so let's go ahead and see if we can
actually update the employee information
so as you can see now we're starting to
run into just our standard SQL commands
and so we want to be able to update the
employee from a browser
and as you can tell we're not using uh
any forms or any other types of Records
we're just simply interacting
um with between the the uh the browser
the server and the database
and the new name will be updated name
yeah appropriate record
and we'll show that we're matching
against 181
all right so that's wrong
[Music]
Jake Smith is there
now go and select
Ed me
colon same slash one
we've now gone ahead and updated
the object uh Jake Smith's information
so let's click on complete table and we
now see he says dated name I know not
very creative but it allows you to see a
change
and finally we can go ahead and delete
the record as well
so it's going to be similar to update
but I'm deleting instead
I'm going to delete
the record from the employee table
where the theme equals where I T equals
sorry
and
18.
and then we want to be able to
show that the record has been deleted
[Music]
[Music]
looks like deleted and we go to uh
database I mean that you see
from the employee table
but there are no entries
the 100 record that was there has been
deleted
and so this shows you how you can very
easily control everything
from using your connection into MySQL
right from node package manager
you can create table
you can select your records
you can then update any record that you
selected
and finally you can delete any record
books
you want to be able to delete
so what we're going to do is so what's
in it for you so in this presentation
we're going to go through three key
things you know what is mongodb how do
you connect to mongodb with node.js and
mongodb is part of the Moon stack so
we're going to cover what the merge
stack is and how it applies to node.js
so what is mongodb so mongodb is a it's
a probably the most popular nosql
database out there it's cross-platform
and very easy to scale it's available on
all Cloud systems you can also run it
locally which is what we'll be doing
later on in our demo but it's just a
very flexible database environment for
modern applications
it works on the concept of collection
and documents
um what you'll find is uh mongodb was
originally written in C plus plus and it
is what's referred to as a nosql
database so this is different to a
relational database which is built up of
tables with rows and columns this is a
nosql database as simply a lot faster
and more powerful for the work that
you're doing
and you're able to use mongodb very easy
you can actually go ahead and download
it we'll actually do that as part of our
demo so you know why connect node.js
with mongodb
well the reason why you want to do this
is that mongodb is a modern database
it's not restricted by the the the
challenges of scalability that order
relational databases have it's really
designed for building mobile
applications and websites that scale
into the millions and millions of users
so mongodb probably the most important
feature is scalability the performance
of the database is phenomenal
and it is extremely highly available for
the solutions that you'll be creating so
when you push it out your solution to
the cloud you almost guarantee it's
always going to be running
you also have the ability to be able to
scale to very large complex
multi-site Solutions we've had one of
the very first mongodb applications I
built was a multi-tenant environment and
it just worked really well
and you'll be able to easily deploy your
surgeons across Microsoft Azure AWS
Google Cloud
Etc so you know why do you want to keep
connecting to mongodb um I think
probably
um one of the other areas that probably
is often forgotten with manga it's just
the concept around Big Data you can I
mean when you talk about big data and
you're talking about absolutely massive
massive databases and mongodb is front
and center for all of that
you can do your effective content
management and delivery
um it has an effective mobile and social
infrastructure so by that it allows you
to be able to build out solutions that
can go to all modern day types of
applications and the data is actually
very easy to manage through your central
data hub
and then finally being able to connect
to mongodb is very easy
um particularly as there is a client
called Mongoose that makes the
connections extremely easy so you know
fun really um let's kind of look into
how DB is part of the Moon Stag
so Moon stack is a JavaScript stack and
it's of JavaScript solutions that are
built for modern single page
applications and there are four key
Solutions in the merge stack there's
mongodb which is your database Express
which is your server side HTTP
environment react which is the solution
for being able to create your Solutions
on the client and the node.js which
actually manages the whole environment
it's really an environment that's
designed to make it very easy to be able
to build out modern day Solutions so
mongodb is the am in Moon Express is the
E react is the r and node js is the n so
again as you start working with some of
our other videos that we have here
you'll be able to see how all of these
tools really complement each other so
we've done an introduction on DB
really the best thing now is to get you
out you know your hands dirty by
actually doing a demo so we're going to
go through a demo what I would strongly
encourage you however though is that
this demo really does build on a lot of
the other videos that we've done in this
series uh so you really do want to spend
some time on the node.js video the
node.js for Express video the node.js
for apis video really all of those
videos help complement the work that
you'll be doing with this video here
you'll see some real strong correlations
plus a lot of new content as well so
with that we're going to jump into the
demo
so let's do our demonstration on how to
use mongodb with node.js first thing we
want to do is go ahead and install
node.js so you're going to go and do
Google Search node.js and that should
bring up a result of going to nodejs.org
and here you can download node.js for
multiple platforms so Windows Linux Mac
OS they're all supported you can also
get the original source code and
recompile your version of node.js if you
want to
now we're just going to install the
windows version
and the next thing you want to do is
install your favorite text editor I'm
going to install Visual Studio code vs
code it runs on all leading platforms
Mac OS windows and Linux it is open
source you can edit it and I like it
because you can do an awful lot with it
just a lot of extensions it's just a
great tool all around
so that's the next thing you want to
install
and then we want to go ahead and we want
to go to
mongodb.com so we can install the
DB database
so you want to go to Software
Community server
and you want to then select
the
mongodb community server
which platform you want
and where it's going to connect with
and you want to select the download to
install that
and that'll take a moment or two for you
to download and get that up and running
once you've done that we want to go
ahead and we're going to open up vs code
so we can start editing and the code
that we need for our new solution
so let's go ahead and create a folder of
our desktop that we'll use for mongodb
so I already have a folder created
called demo I'm just going to select
that and then inside there I'm going to
put in node mongodb
and select that folder
and that's going to open up vs code it's
going to have our folder in here so
we're going to get rid of the welcome
screen we don't need that
um we do want to however open up our
terminal window so we're going to run
that this is one of the things that I
really like about vs code is you can
actually have your terminal window or
command line window actually inside the
development environment you're working
in so you don't have to be jumping from
one solution to another and then we're
going to initialize our package so npm
in it for the folder that we're in it's
going to create our uh no package
manager it's going to create our default
package and we're going to hit return
that's going to go ahead and start the
process
and we're just going to go with the
default settings
that npm is going to give so just hit
return return a few times and that will
get up and running for you
and our entry point for the application
is going to be index.js
oh yeah that's uh
JS package and there we have everything
this is just the uh the the Json package
that provides the instructions that npm
would use to pass the um the program now
you notice that we have index.js as our
leading file so we actually have to add
a new file here and we're just going to
Tool this one index.js so we actually
have a file that can be referenced
and now we're going to go ahead and
we're going to actually put in our
default application so Express is going
to be required so we're going to make
sure that that is included in our first
line of our instructions
and then we're also going to
have a path that's required
and
we're going to require handlebars
and these are all part of our Express
environment
and don't forget to save your file as
you're going along
and we're also going to have
Express pH BS
and this is going to be our Express
handlebars
and we're all going to
allow
insecure
prototype
you would normally do this but because
we're running everything locally it just
makes it easier for you to actually get
all the code in
thanks
and then we're also going to add in
body parsa
and these are all the required solutions
that we need to be installed when you're
running this package
and so let's save the file and then
let's go ahead and run it so we're going
to do npn install
and we do dash dash save and this will
install Express
and we also have install path
uh handlebars
Express handlebars
um
and this is where we'll install the
prototyping
and we'll also have the body parser
installed and we're just going to run
that
this will just take a moment or two to
install
all right there we go
so we have everything installed which
allows us to now start working with our
Scripts
so we're going to create an app in
Express
thank you
and we're going to listen on Port 3000
and we're gonna have a message then go
to our console log
and we have everything running off our
local port on localhost on Port 3000 so
let's go and we're going to select node
index.js and shows us everything's
running
which is good you can actually test this
in our web browser if we wanted to
okay so let's start working on our app
so our app is going to
use body parser
and we're going to encode
our request
and the goal here is we're going to
create a file that's going to go back
and forth
to mongos among two mongodb
so body parts is going to use Json to
encrypt
the content
and we're going to do a get command to
get our results
and if we worked if you've seen the API
video then we did that here in fact it's
probably a good idea to actually sit
down and look through some of the other
videos that we've created such as the
Json sorry the node.js node.js for
Express node.js for apis and node.js for
authentication before doing this video
we're going to create a default page and
it's going to say welcome to the
students database
the principles that we're putting down
here you'll be able to apply to any
solution that you're creating with
mongodb
and so we want to have a simple action
that we're going to
put on here which is going to be
click to gain access
okay we're gonna put in the path and
where to get the list from
okay
all right so here is our basic web page
that we're creating
nothing fancy
but it's going to take you to a place
where you can actually get all the
content now what we're going to do is
we're actually going to go and pull the
content from manga
so run this and we can open our web
browser you'll see what it looks like
let's go to localhost
close out these other tabs don't need
them localhost three pounds and
and there we see welcome to the student
database click on the database and you
click on if we click on it now nothing
will happen so yeah nothing there
so let's make something happen
okay
all right so
begin extending our app so what we're
going to do is we want to
set
the views
and I'm going to do a join
our directory name
and app
engine
so let's go for our views we don't have
engine yet but let's go ahead and create
a new folder
we can call that one views and let's
expand that
actually that should be okay
HPS
Express handlebars
and we're going to allow prototype
access for our Express sample pause
so with Express handlebars if this is
new to you it allows you to separate
your content from your layout
which if you have developed with swift
for a mobile application on the Mac
using xcode is the same principle there
but for a web application
so we're just putting out here
some of our
uh default environment settings
and we're going to set our view engine
for handlebars
and just checking through our code it's
looking good
okay so that provides
that so let's create a new folder under
our views and this one we're going to
call layouts so again this is where we
are splitting our layouts
and we're going to have
a photo called models at the root of our
application and under models we're going
to put in
db.js so the dbjs file is going to be
where we put our instructions for our
database and so here we're going to go
ahead and we're going to require to
import Mongoose and Mongoose is a tool
in node.js that allows you to connect to
mongodb
so we're going to require the use of
Mongoose and so we're going to do npm
install Dash say save mongoose
and that's going to run and install on
our local machine so we can actually
test this out
and once we've got this installed what
we're going to do is we're going to
start connecting to a database that
we're going to call student DB
okay we're already already installed so
let's go Mongoose dot connect
and
we're going to call it mongodb
and
we're going to run this off our Local
Host
so we installed the community version
that I was just trying to file logo host
and it's going to run from the port
27017 I'm going to call this one student
DB
so again with our application we're
splitting out all the functionality so
if you want to reuse elements you can
so we're going to have a new user URL
parser
then we'll make job capture
everything correctly
okay so if Arrow then we'll send a
message to the console log
and we have either connection is
successful or things go wrong
error in connection
and then if there is an error then what
we'll do is we'll have the error message
posted
okay
and then we'll do require
[Music]
student
dot model so this will actually call the
model we're going to create
and so what we're going to do now is
creating
under models we're going to create
student dot model
dot Js
and this is where we're going to do
our instructions for our student model
so first thing you want to do is we want
to import
Mongoose Express and the student model
so I've got to make sure we have
everything and capture that
so let's go up to
our student model
all right so let's make sure that we
have everything so we want to have
mongoose
and
we'll create a new variable called
student schema this will allow us to
structure what our model will look like
and this will be a
a new
new schema
in using mongoose
and our new schema is going to be full
name
and we're going to break down
our
Jason's package so we're going to put in
the instructions for what
schema would look like so
we have the type we have a required this
field is required
and
the second value is going to be email
string
this field is required
there's the message error message you
want to send if the field isn't filled
out
mobile phone number this will be just a
number
and we're going to have City
and subtype will be
let's just make this a string we're just
going to try and keep this simple for
right now
let's
acquired
all right so here's our schema
looking pretty good
all right Mongoose dot model
and connect this to our
student model
so we want to go ahead and save that
you can
create a new folder and this new folder
is going to be called controllers
and we have a new file under controllers
and that new file is going to be called
student controller
dot Js
let's go in
see what we're going to add here
so we want to import make sure and we're
running Express
so Express is required for our
controller
we also want to set up a variable for
router
so router Express dot router
and we want to make sure we're also
connecting with mongoose
so we have a connection to our mongodb
and we also want to make sure that we
have
a connection to our student model
so mongus Mongoose dot model
and a suit model
and this allows us to make sure that we
have
this student model
pulled over effectively for our
controller for our student controller
okay so let's go to router
get
I'm going to render this
and student slash add or edit
we'll come into that in just a moment
so we want to be able to
View Title and this will pull in
the insert
student
I'm going to use under our views
we're going to create a new folder
and this one's going to be called
student
and we're going to create a new file and
this one will be add or edit
dot JS oh HPS sorry for our handlebar
so you notice we don't have to put the
file extension
uh you know JS manages all that for us
so router dot post
so this will be
our we're going to get our content and
then we're also going to post content so
the post will go back and it's part of
our body and there'll be an ID
so we want to then insert insert the
record that we'll be creating
so again if you've been if you've worked
through the node.js API video then
you'll start seeing if there's some
commonalities here of being able to
insert or update a record
and we actually cover that using just a
sample Json package this really takes it
to that next level
okay
okay so we want to put in a new student
record and so be student
and we're going to have that full name
it's going to come from our body
and we're going to also capture the
email
essentially we're going to follow the
model that we created
foreign
City
[Music]
and then we want to save the record that
we create
okay
all right so we're going to manage our
error message
[Music]
similar messages that we've put in
before
so we want to redirect to our student
list
and we're going to go ahead and create
that in a moment
so
let's create a new file student list.hbs
so list.hbs
and here
so what we do is with student list
that's actually going to manage then the
controls for being able to display the
records in the database
and then we'll put
um message if there's an error then you
know we'll put an error message there
and ask you to report the error message
I'm going to try and not do that
all right so
now the next step we need to go through
is we want to call a function to update
the record
and let's go in ahead and we're going to
update our records and we do the
student.find1 and update command
okay
okay so we will redirect to our student
list as needed if not we'll throw an
error message to our console log
yeah looking good
and again this is just an example but
something that you'll be able to do
yourself
whether your own solution
and
then we want to like go back to our list
to then render
the records
and here we want to put student and then
how we're going to find the record
let's
we'll throw a error message to our
console log
so as you can see we always throw an
error message to the console log
error messages are really useful
okay all right looks good
save that
okay let's do another router and this is
two
we're gonna do the router against ID
so allow us to get the content
so be able to get information by ID of
the student
and what you can see is there's a lot of
the work we're doing here
is very repetitive
um and
you'll find as you create more modular
code that it makes it easier for you to
write your code and update and manage
your code
okay so we're going to
get out View Title we're going to put
into our document
okay
all right so our next router
is
we want to be able to delete our record
by ID
and so we're going to do is we're going
to find our records last stream record
and we just find it by ID
and then we'll just find by find ID and
remove
okay so we're gonna
to once we've removed your record we're
going to redirect to our list so we can
show our student list
will send an error message to our
console log
okay
so I think we have what we need
maybe this maybe there's one more thing
I think we need to do
I think this is good
okay so let's go to our
layouts add a new file there we're going
to call this one main layout
dot HBS
and here we're going to put the skeleton
of our web page together
let's
write this out so we've been a HTML
code
and
we're just going to keep this real
simple
I'm gonna hit a
we want to title
and this is going to be students
database
I'm gonna maybe we just put students
so
we now go to
[Music]
try and find out bootstrap four we're
going to just grab that
and we're going to use
bootstrap to get started and there are a
couple of components there's a CSS
component and then there's the
JavaScript component so let's just go
copy there CSS component
and then we're going to just link that
into the header section of us
web page
so and then
here's examples different components you
can create
if you're not used if you haven't used
bootstrap before it's an open source
framework they're originally developed
by Twitter great tool so in our header
we want to
put in the link to the CSS
as that
and
now all I need to also
in our own styles
so we've got here some styles that we
created earlier on for
you can just paste those in
so we have a box style that we want to
use that will extend the Box style that
you get
with bootstrap
all right so we're going to start
working on our body content
plus BG info so this is actually BG info
is
a CSS class file from bootstrap that you
can use
and you have the ID of box
and again we're going to do
another class
which allows us for our table structure
so a little bit of knowledge of
bootstrap is great here
so what we're going to do now is going
to put in
the content which we're going to call
Body missile show up on the screen
so again for pulling from records within
bootstrap dig through bootstraps lots of
content there for you to be able to take
advantage of
okay
so now we want to be able to add or edit
our record
View Title
and the
um
the the the French brackets allow you to
be able to pull records and content
directly from the code that we're
writing
so playing title from insert record on
this part of our router
command
and then we'll put in our form
which will be student post
I'm just going to do a basic form here
nothing fancy
we will put in the first
record will be a hidden field this will
be for ID
because we want to want to generate the
ID we don't have somebody to put that in
and then we will put in
ah
form elements
so we'll have first will be label
it'll be full name
will be
the input field
so be texting the input field
and
again we're using form Dash control
which is from
bootstrap CSS and then we'll have
full name
and placehold before name so if where we
have name there will actually match up
with
the value that we're putting in our
model
so here we have student for name
so we're matching everything up to the
model that we created
okay so let's do this for our remaining
form elements
and again as you see we can put this
together really quickly
foreign
[Music]
City
and here we keep going
to put in form group
and we'll be able to have the
type of
tool for putting in Mobile
so as you can see because we're using
just standard HTML here you can actually
reference external libraries such as
JavaScript libraries for formatting the
field that you're in regular Expressions
things like that
and let's put in our final value
which will be for City
and normally when I'd be writing this by
hand I would actually be copy and
pasting sections of code and just
changing the values as necessary
just to make it easier on myself but
here I'm just typing out everything for
you so you can see the
whole process
okay
all right so there are our values
of course remember save your files as
you're going along
everything looks good
and we're matching up our values
with our
records
and we want to have a button that allows
you to submit
we also want to have a button to select
view or if you want to be able to view
all the records okay
looking good
okay let's go back over to list now we
want to be able to pull our records so
this will display
the
list of students
in a table
and
let's go ahead and format that table
so we're going to put together our
format here but then we're also going to
add buttons at the bottom so we can
actually add a record to the database or
if we want to add or delete a particular
record from the database
I'm going to call this one
create a new student record or a student
list
I'm just going to type all this in for
you
thank you
and you'll see how we put placeholders
for the values as we put them in
these are our table headers
okay
from that body content
and what we're going to do here is we're
going to add in
an element that allows you to create a
row for each item listed
so if you have two or more items they'll
appear as an individual row
on here and again what we're doing is
we're pulling in the values to be able
to
pull from the model that we created
earlier on so this being the data that's
been submitted so we have it pull in the
value for the email full name
mobile and City
we're not going to show ID
so I was playing out all of this data
that we created earlier on
so we have everything posted into our
list
as documents
so let's go into a HPS file
and it's our list
let's put in our
file entry here
this will be for City
then
this is just a placeholder
at the end
of the list
oh yeah you know what we're going to do
is we can add in
reference for the ID
so if we want to edit the document we
can
and then we want to do the same thing if
we want to delete the document
so href equals
student
and then
just delete
now delete based on the ID
there we go
passing that instruction over
so click
to
simple
I'm gonna assume are you sure you want
to
delete that somebody clicks on the
record they hit cancel then it won't get
deleted if they hit okay then it will
get deleted
this is what you can actually write
jsonline
okay
and then we want to close out where the
row will end so have each opens and
closes the record
just tying up some of the HTML there
save that
okay looking good
back to our root index file
so let's see now
we want to also require
our model
and then
we'll have our student controller
will also be
a require
of where it's going to pull the student
controller from
okay
and this is just the instructions on
where we can actually find
content
okay it looks good so let's do node xjs
everything's saved we're going to rerun
everything
and we got an error
let's go check out where our error came
from
so let's go and to our files
this is one that we created
so
error is in
June controller see where's the arrow
oh we need to
have a much we need to export our module
to our router
all right let's go open up
database
and we can just start
seeing where the records are
installing release updates here
foreign
that's the port
let's just double check that make sure
we're
completely aligned so here's our
database connection
and
there's our report and student database
and we did this with mongod Mongoose for
connecting to manga
so I'm going to connect
and here are where our records have been
stored
so we're going to create a database and
we're going to call this database
it's going to be called student TB
student DB has to be case sensitive
and the picture name is students
let's go ahead and create a database so
there we are there's our database
and
let's go we run our index.js file
and everything was successful
this is good
all right
so everything should have passed
successfully good good
database connection is good
so let's go to localhost
and here we are so we can start
achieving navigating through our
application
so we see we have uh setup we have no
records
so let's go ahead and create one
and we go through you can actually start
stepping through the different layouts
that you've created so here's our layers
a separate to our code so there's some
spacing we probably need to add there so
let's go ahead and just add that
and let's rerun our code
this is the fun bits where you know
everything is
just tidying up okay so you know it puts
in one line in one space because we
didn't put in the actual HTML code for
Green multiple spaces
so we're going to go in and select
insert so let's put in
Smith and we'll do Smith at gmail.com
[Music]
and let's just put in I know random
phone number
there we go we don't have any formatting
so we could put anything in there and
the city uh
where am I
um this I'm in Delhi so split that
hit submit and it takes us to a list and
voila
we actually have a list with a record in
now if we go back to our database we can
actually refresh it and now we actually
start seeing our records being created
and we see the ID is automatically
created and there's our records
okay let's go back
and now we can select edit we can edit
the record
so let's change our city to
Bangalore hit submit
all right city is now Bangalore
and if we want to we can
edit again
and so this is pulling in
you know if we do a delete It's Gonna
ask us do we want to delete
okay
a little bit of formatting apply there
and the records are all good so we had
to make that Smith change
but because we need to hit submit to an
update record
so we hit submit I've cheats the record
we hit delete it's gonna say are you
sure we say yes we are
and ah
it has
couldn't grab that record okay so let's
go back look at my code
and
because we have everything separated and
actually now just go to our student
controller
and we'll find out Delete and you guys
delete and we had a
now we had a couple of minor errors
there this is where it's good to test
out your code
okay let's run that again
and refresh everything
go to our database we're gonna go create
a new entry
let's call this one with some John John
gmail.com
we will put in the phone number
you see the the formatting is just
playing from
um
are uh bootstrap so there we have
there's John do we want to delete this
say yes
easy there we go also
and we hit refresh the record should be
gone yep it is
and so we've created an application
where we can update applications
we can create an application we can list
all the items and we did all of this
using uh just open source Solutions
through node.js and I was with using
express some of the components come with
Express uh mongodb for our database and
then Mongoose to connect to our database
hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel I hope you guys
are doing well today we will be taking
you through the express.js full course
this express.js full course is designed
in such a way that it will help you
understand the most widely used concepts
of express.js in an exciting manner
you will see how to create a simple rest
API in this video by the end of this
tutorial you will be able to understand
and deploy the express.js
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on
programming videos so if you are a
programmer and want to learn something
new then consider getting subscribed to
our YouTube channel and press that Bell
icon to never miss any update from
Simply learn so let's go through the
agenda for this full course
first we'll see the introduction to this
course after that we'll see what is
express.js
moving ahead we will see how to install
express.js
after that we will see express.js get
post method in detail
moving ahead we will see what is a
middleware and its function then we will
create a middle variant express.js
moving ahead we will see express.js test
API and then we will see react with
express.js in this we will also see how
to connect the server side to the client
site after that
we will see what is typescript and how
to connect node and express.js
and in last we will be creating an user
registration form with Express so let's
begin
I hope you guys are ready to learn
something new now we will start our
first topic
node.js is a file JavaScript runtime
environment but it does not support
request handling functions HTTP methods
or serving files so express.js comes
into the picture Express makes the
node.js code easier as Express provides
a wide range of features to develop both
web and mobile applications it is used
to build single page multi-page and
hybrid page web applications as Express
is written in JavaScript it is very easy
to understand for the developers who
know JavaScript until now Express is the
most popular framework of node.js
you must have heard about mean stack in
web development right where e stands for
express.js
it is a back-end part of means tag it
manages routing HTTP methods sessions
error handling Etc
let's see what express.js is
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross platform mobile apps quickly and
easily it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated that is
there is no structural way to write a
code XPS does not force you to write a
code in a fixed manner
express.js is used as a server-side
scripting language
let's see the need for express.js but
before that let me give you an example
if you have to write a rest API using
the core modules of node.js and the same
using the framework express.js you will
realize that with the help of express it
will take 5 to 10 times less code and
time
that was the reason behind creating
express.js framework for node.js
Express JS is time efficient fast money
efficient very easy to learn and
asynchronous let's see the features of
expressjs
for server-side development with the
features of node.js XP saves a lot of
time middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
application's request response cycle
routing this refers to how an
application's endpoints URLs respond to
client requests
templating
it provides templating engines to build
Dynamic content on the web pages by
creating HTML templates on the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
let's see the advantages of express.js
Express is unopeniated and we can
customize it and use it as per our needs
as it is written in JavaScript a single
language is used for front-end back-end
development
Express is fast to link it with
databases like MySQL mongodb Etc
let's see the disadvantages the
disadvantage of express.js is that there
is no structural way to organize things
sometimes the code becomes
non-understandable
there are so many issues with callbacks
the error messages that will come are
very challenging to understand
now we'll see the companies that are
using express.js the major companies are
IBM Uber eBay PayPal essential Fox
Sports Netflix LinkedIn
as per the nlib.com there are more than
34 300 companies that are using
express.js
now I think you guys have a brief idea
about Express as it is a lightweight
framework that gives functionalities to
make node.js easy
express.js is trending so much because
it is helping so many developers to save
their time it is so awesome that most of
the companies are moving towards it
if you know JavaScript and node.js the
framework expresses what you should know
to strengthen your coding skills
now here
you'll find downloads
you can download node from here
and install it but if you find any
difficulties downloading node.js you can
click on the link in the right corner to
see how to download node.js
now let's see the version for node to
verify here I am using visual studio
code you can go and search it and simply
download vs code
after opening your Visual Studio code
will look like this
here
you will find a terminal click on it
the terminal window will open
here we will write node
hyphen B
this will show us the latest version of
node.js
now we need to update the npm which is
node packet manager this bundle consists
of all the repositories and packages
required for development purposes to do
that npm install npm globally
NVM install
VM hyphen
globally
this will download all the npm packages
globally now let's create Express for
that first we need to create a separate
folder where we will keep all the
modules and files of express.js
let's clean this PLS
you can open the terminal by clicking on
the shortcut also by pressing Ctrl and
back tag that will open the terminal for
you
let's make a folder mkdir
this is a command that is used to create
a folder on the terminal then we will
write our file name I will write Express
bye
simply learn
enter
here you can see the file name expressed
by simply learn has been created
you can also click here
and enter your file name
m.js
press enter
as you can see a new file has been
created
now we need to install a package manager
that is npm
we will write a npm command open your
terminal again
write a command
npm
in it
enter
version enter description and
description you can write Express
tutorial
by
simply an enter
key repository if you have your git
repository you can add yours enter
author
relearn
license enter
press yes
after this
you can see npm created a Json file
now we will finally install express.js
we will write npm
install
Express
enter
now as you can see our Express is
installed in our system
let's open the app.js that we have
created earlier
now we will create a express application
with the help of Express functions that
we can do by requiring the express
modules let's create a first program
first
constant
Express
require
Express
in this line we are requiring the
express module
const
a name equals to function
Express
dot get
to get the file
request response
to get the request and the response
of the user
in
we will need to pass callback function
here
let's write
response send
this message will be shown
in the server welcome
2
will come to Simply learn
now here
we will write our port number where the
message will be shown to us add dot
lesson
4000 you can write anything
here also we are passing the Callback
function
console
DOT log in control log we will see the
message in the console
listening to Port
number
four thousand
close this line
save this
let's run it open your terminal new
terminal
now to run this file
we need to go to the express
folder
CD
Express
by simply learn
we are now in a simply land folder
now the easiest way is to write the file
name write node
space
the file name app.js
enter
now you can see it is printing our
message listening to Port 4000 now we
will see a message on the server
open your Chrome
type localhost 4000
press enter
and here we go a message is successfully
displayed welcome to Simply learn
get in post method are the standard HTTP
request used to create rest apis
get in post methods are used to send and
receive significant amount of data
the client sends a request in the form
of Json file and with the help of HTTP
requests which are get post and other
methods it will go to the server and
then the server sends back the response
to the client in the form of a message
to tell what happened to the request
that was sent to the server
now
express.js get method
get is a method that is used to request
data from the server but mainly this
method is used to read data
to handle get request in Express is
pretty straightforward
get requests are to be cached and
remains in the browser history and
that's why the get method is not used
for sensitive data
to get the data we add parameters in the
URL and get data in response get method
is more efficient and popular than the
post method
now we'll see express.js post method
host method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data this method
is used to communicate with large amount
of data
the post method is secure because the
data is passed in a request body and not
visible in the URL and the user is not
able to bookmark it mostly we use get
method only but when we want to send a
sensitive data we use post method
now we will see how to get the post and
get methods work
now open your Visual Studio code
I have already installed node and
express if you haven't installed it then
you can click on the right corner of
this video to get the setup done
coming back to express get and post
methods
now what I have done here is I have
created a basic express.js app
const app require Express this will
install all our Express modules
now first we will write our gate method
so let's start
first we will write get method
then we will initialize how it will be
called well write get
this OS
we create inconvenient request
parameters request and response
and we'll write the fat Arrow function
in this
we will send a response
the server
hello
this it is
full
okay
let's I have not initialized the
brackets
let's see where I have not done oh
God to write this
now let's just save this file
we will run this file open your terminal
and write node
Dot
and
I think I have done something wrong
let's again open the terminal
right node
Dot so it is showing server is
successfully running on Port 4000.
now we'll open our Chrome and write
localhost
printer
as I have told you earlier this needs a
parameter so we'll initialize here
get request
hello this is successful get request
so a request method is working fine
now
we'll go back to the post method and see
how it goes
app dot post
request
foreign
just like this only
just
post
hello
this is
cool
post
he now will run save this first and then
run it in the terminal
yes no
dot server is running out four thousand
we have to write this so first copy from
here only
open your terminal and here we can write
post Quest enter
so what you can see here is it can't get
post request
for this to see we need to have the
postman I'm using Postman here
I will write post method
and here I will write the
localhost 4000 and the post request
method then we'll press send
here
in the body part we will see hello this
is successful post request
how this is working is because post
method is secure and data is passed in
the request body and it cannot be
fetched in the URL
what is middleware middleware is a
request Handler that has access to the
applications request response cycle it
is a function that contains the request
subjects response object and the next
middleware function
middleware can also send the response to
the server before the request
the next middleware function is commonly
donated by the variable named next
simply middleware is a function that can
only be applied using routers with the
help of middleware we can access and
modify request and response
now we will see what are the functions
of middleware middleware can execute any
code
it can make changes to the request
response objects
middleware can also end the request
response cycle
it can call the next middleware function
in the stack
we use these functions to modify our
middleware to perform many tasks like if
you want to block our site from some
country or if you want to check the
authentication of a user

description to know more
now we are going to create a simple
middleware
we can create a middleware in a router
file but the best way is to create a
middleware file separately and then use
it creating and using middleware is very
easy
now we first need to create a basic
express application but before that you
must have all the app packages to run
Express
you can take the help of our video what
is express.js the link will be in the
description
you need to install npm Express to run
this so coming back to our application
first we need
const
express application
so we'll write constant
Express
required
Express
now we'll write constant app equals to
express
function
now to get the data we'll write app Dot
get
request
response
response
foreign
welcome to
simpler
now all we'll copy paste this
to get the
home page the better ways to like
copy pasted
here
we'll write the extension of the next
page
home will say
and welcome to this villains
it's a very basic middleware application
we are going to create
list
homepage
now we'll make it listen to some Port so
we'll write
add Dot listen
Port will say report
four thousand
again that Arrow function
control
log
right listening
um
this message will be prompting to us on
the control determinant
so we'll close these brackets
now and save this file
open your terminal
first we need to go to this folder CD
Express
by
put on
enter
now is right
file name
called enter
so it's showing
listening to Port 4000 now we'll open
our Chrome
local server
type localhost 4000 enter
so it is successfully showing us welcome
to Simply learn now we'll go to the next
page we have written their home
enter
so it's successfully showing welcome to
Simply learns homepage
now
we'll create a middleware go back to
that file
we'll write
strength
require filter
request
you can write anything here request
object
spawn subject
and next
in the fat Arrow function
you will write console log
okay
we have written request
we'll use this
vibrating
app dot use
request
filter
and save this file
now
we haven't
called our next parameter in Express
framework next is a function
what we'll do is we'll call it in the
bottom of our middleware
will write
next
question
save this file
again we'll open our new terminal
and we'll go to the path folder Express
by simply run
well
like node the file name I have got here
enter
and I'll open our file go to the
home
right localhost 4000 enter
it is printing welcome to Simply learn
we'll go to the home page
slash
okay welcome to Simply learns homepage
with this we have successfully reached
the end of this video
npm which is called as node package
manager is node.js built in package
manager by default and express.js is a
framework of node.js which is fully
built in JavaScript
it was first made and available for use
in January 12 2010.
let's move on to what is npm
let's take async as an example npm is
incredibly easy to use and all you need
to do is to type npm install async to
install the desired module in the
current directory under node module
folder you may use neet function on them
as they use built-ins once installed in
your node modules folder
the biggest software registry in the
world is npm there are more than 80 lakh
code packages in the registry to share
software open source developers utilize
npm npm is often used by businesses to
control private growth
all of the node.js packages and modules
are managed through npm which also
includes the npm command line client
along with the installation of node.js
it is added to the system npm is used to
install the necessary modules and
packages in the node project
moving ahead let's see what is a package
in node.js the package includes every
file required for a module
you can add module in a JavaScript
libraries to your project
now let's see the functions of node
package manager which is npm
online node.js packages modules
repositories can be searched on
node.js.org
use a command line tool to manage
node.js packages dependencies Version
Control and installation
now let's see how to install npm
to install node package manager we have
to install node.js for that you have to
download node.js and install it in your
system
now we will see the version of node.js
go to terminal new terminal
and search here
foreign
V which is denoted as version enter and
this is my version of node
now we will verify the npm version to do
that we have to run a command
write npm hyphen hyphen version
and you can clearly see my npm version
is 8.5.3
now we will see how we can install node
modules using npm this is a very simple
Syntax for that we just have to write
npm install and that module name
now we will install the famous web
framework module of node.js we will
simply write a command
npm
install
Express
this is a very simple command you can
write in your console or terminal and
then press enter
foreign
you can clearly see
the express is installed in our system
what is error handling
array handling is a process in which
express catches and processes the error
that occurs synchronously and
asynchronously
Express comes with its own default error
handlers
simply in error handling the tasks are
to identify errors report them to the
users and then develop some recovery
strategies and Implement them to handle
the errors
this whole process should not slow the
overall processing time of the program
now
how does error handling Works in
express.js
xbox.js comes in with a built-in error
Handler this default error handling
middleware function is added at the end
of the middleware function stack
it automatically catches all errors in
router handlers and allow developers to
extend router handling functionalities
by middleware function
error handling in Express is done using
middleware this middleware is defined in
the same way as other middleware
functions the errored handling functions
have four arguments error request
response and next
we have next function method that
matches us to the next middleware
Handler in middleware
in error handling we have the next error
method this function skips all
middleware and matches us to the next
error Handler for the router now let's
set up our handling with Express
open your Visual Studio code choose from
over 300 in-demand skills and get access
to 1000 plus hours of video content for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more first we will create a new
directory
for that
open your terminal
new terminal
let's try it
make directory
now I will enter the directory name
I will write
simply learn
or you can also write
error
press enter
you can see the error and Link directory
has been created it's empty let's go
inside that CD
PD error handling
now we are in the link folder so
now let's create a new project here
we'll write npm
in it
hash
y
so as you can see
the Json file has been created in the
error handling folder
now
we will install couple of packages here
okay
first we will install Express write npm
install
Express
now we will also install Morgan
which locks the request
after that we'll also install HTTP
errors
errors this package makes it very easy
to check the status code
and then last
we will install node dot EnV
press enter
this will take couple of seconds
now in the dependencies
you can see dot EnV Express HTTP errors
and Morgan
now I will create a file in this error
handling folder
right app dot JS enter
now let's install node bond which helps
us not to reset our file again and again
for that we'll write in the
npm
install
is minus sign save
node mod
enter
this will also take couple of seconds
now
here you can see
the node one has been successfully
installed
now open your package.json files
here
in packet.json file
you can see here
this line
I will rewrite this
you can also remove it let's write
script
and in this
I will write
note
tab dot JS yes
save this file by pressing Ctrl s
yes
now open the file app.js
here we will be importing some packages
in node.js we use require function right
so we'll write const
Express
required
and
Express
here we need Express packages
now we will be needing Morgan
we will write const
ant
require
D then
now like this we will need HTTP packages
const
error
create
error
require
D http
errors
we also need dot EnV packages to import
our environment variables for that we
will simply write required
choir
tactic
Dot EnV
y Dot
config
for this command we need a EnV file we
will create a file
dot EMV
printer
and here we have our EnV file where we
can have our environment variables
first we want a port for this
application so we will write the port
3000
save this file
now again go back to the app.js file
foreign
first we will be initializing our app
we'll write cons
app
Express function
now we will start the application for
this we will write
const
ant port
to which it will be called process
dot EMB Dot
port
3000
now we'll make our application listen to
Port 3000 we will write
app dot lesson
port number
port
it will call the port number
and here
we will call the Callback function
better function
and here we will make our block
statement for this we'll write console
DOT log
tag
server
it is running
on
port
dollar sign
and
port
now let me start the application before
that we'll save this file
now to start the application we'll write
npm
start enter
here it is showing error let's find out
okay
here
I have wrote script
here we need to write start
save this file
and now clear this screen
enter npm
so as you can see it is successfully
running in the port 3000 rest API are
the standard way to send and receive
data for web services
client sends a request which goes to the
rest API then to the database
to get or put the data after that it
will come back to the rest API and then
to the client
using an API is just like using a
website in a browser but instead
clicking on the buttons we write code to
request data from the server
it is very flexible and can handle
multiple types of requests
restful API is very popular and very
commonly used to create apis for
web-based applications
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
and cross-platform mobile applications
it is used as a server-side scripting
language
express.js is high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated
we'll see what is rest API but before
that what is rest and what is API
rest means representational State
transfer rest is a popular architecture
which is used to create web services
Now API is a application programming
interface it is a code that allows two
software programs to communicate with
each other
rest API is a software that allows two
applications to communicate with each
other with the help of internet and
various devices now
we will see the HTTP request types first
one is get it is used to request data
from the server but mainly this method
is used to read data
next one is path it is used to update
the data or to change or replace it next
is
post
post method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data
after that it is delete
delete method is used to delete the data
completely from the server
now we will see the complete
architecture of HTTP request type in
this client sends a request in the form
of Json file
and with the help of HTTP request which
are get patch post and delete it will go
to the server
and then sends back the response to the
client in the form of message
to tell what happened to the request
and now we will create a simple restful
API from scratch
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1000 plus hours of
video content for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
first you need to open your editor for
this I am using vs code
for this
you need to open your folder
created one folder in the
C drive
express.js
for this
you need to have node.js installed
first open your terminal by clicking on
Terminal New terminal
first we'll write npm
in it
hyphen y
press enter
this will create a Json file
Plus
now let's install express.js
for that
we'll write in PM install
Express
enter
installing express.js
this will add
all the dependencies
for now we have only one Express
installed
we need a file here
to write our code
so we'll create a file called index
dot Js
enter
in this file we will write all our code
when index.js Js
first we'll write const app
where
Express
in this line we have imported the
Express package
which itself is a function
so we'll write parentheses here
to initialize it
now
we will write
accounts
support
we'll write the port number I'm writing
4000 here
this will call a variable which is four
thousand
write app dot lesson
till now our API hasn't defined any
endpoints
this app Dot listen tells the server to
listen on specific Port which we have
defined already as a variable
4000.
now
in app Dot listen we will write a second
argument as call back to tell us the API
is working or not
then we'll write
port
comma
we'll write the Callback function here
require data function
console
Dot log
back take
it's
running
on http
closed
localhost
all the same
and both
which will come under curly breath space
now we can run this app by writing the
command on a terminal
so save this file
terminal
now we'll write the command to run this
file
index node
file name index Dot
Js
so it's successfully showing us it's
running on HTTP port
4000.
0
Chrome or anything
I'm using Chrome here I'll write
localhost
4000
enter
closed enter
can't get
now
if you open this URL you will see
this message
can't get this is because we don't have
any API endpoints as of now
but express.js is still responsing with
error message
you can add an API and call it
every application consists of front-end
login and the database together they
form full start and in this video we
will be talking about react and
express.js
react was created by meta and it is used
to make web application responsive
express.js is unoppediated and it is
used to make apis Express is maintained
by node.js
let's see what is react.js
react is a JavaScript library which is
used to build mobile and web
applications fast and Interactive
it is an open source reusable components
based front-end library of JavaScript
basically with the help of react we can
create a client-side application or user
interface
it is a combination of HTML and
JavaScript
let's see the features of react.js
first jsx
it is a syntax extension of JavaScript
with the help of react.js we can use the
extension to see how the UI should look
like
virtual document object model Dom it
defines how documentar exists and
manipulated in the web page
performance there are several ways to
speed up your regret application by
using virtual Dom
one-way data binding information Flows
In One Direction react receive
information through arguments and pass
it by returning values
react goes beyond simple UI and has many
extensions for complete application
support extended with flux and Redux
among others
debugging it is a small browser
extension to make debugging easier and
faster let's see what is express.js
Express the node.js framework designed
to build apis web applications closed
platform mobile apps quickly and easily
it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated express.js
is used as a server-side scripting
language
let's see the features of express.js
first server side development with the
features of node.js Express saves a lot
of time
middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
application request response cycle
routing
this refers to how an applications
endpoint URLs respond to client requests
templating
it provides templating engines to build
Dynamic content on the web pages by
creating HTML templates on the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
now we'll see how to connect client-side
to the server side first we need to
create a folder I have created a folder
named react Express
let's see go to your save file
here I have created react Express folder
now we will be using a text editor in
this video I will be using visual studio
code let's open it
then
we will add all the npm packages and
create a react application called client
open Terminal
new terminal
let's write some command
npx
hit
react
app
line
enter
this will take some time
until then just wait
yes so it's downloaded
now as you can see the client folder has
been created
with all the npm files
in this client folder you will see all
the npm files known modules
Json file also
yeah
now
we'll go to this folder
CD client
now to get this application running type
npm
start
enter
this command will start and compile this
application now it has opened a web page
localhost 3000
this is the first client-side
application startup page
this will be now working as a client
now let's create a backend application
for that first
clean this terminal
let's open a new terminal
type
npx
Express
engine
data
folder name
press enter
okay
now this will take some time to install
press yes why
as you can see a API folder has been
created
now we'll go to that API folder see the
API in the
now we are in the API folder
let's install
the packages in pm
installed
press enter
this will again download all the
packages
so npm has installed all the packages
required to run this as you can see in
the packages.json file there are all the
repositories and files that I used
now let's terminate this terminal
terminal
now let's go to the client folder
CD
client
press enter
now we are in the client folder
npm
this command will start and compile this
application
now we'll see the standard express
application that has got installed will
again go to the terminal
delete this terminal
create a new terminal
and this will go to the API folder
npm start
let me start the terminal
press enter
now
we'll go to the Chrome
localhost 3000 very refresh it
will see the standard express
application that has got installed
for this type screen type strip is an
object oriented programming language it
is a strongly typed superset of
JavaScript and all the code of
typescript is compiled with JavaScript
only
it is developed and maintained by
Microsoft
typescript was created to develop large
applications
it is mainly used to simplify the
JavaScript code so that it can be read
and debug easily
what is node J
nodejs is an open source cross-platform
JavaScript runtime environment and it
runs on a web application outside the
client browser node.js is used by the
developers to build server-side web
application
notice is perfect for data intensive
application since it uses an
asynchronous event driven model
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
is unopeniated
it is high performance fast lightweight
framework of node.js express.js makes
the node.js code easy as it is used as a
server-side scripting language now we'll
see how to set up node with Express and
typescript open your Visual Studio code
new folder which I have created in the C
drive typescript
it's an empty folder I'll show you
open the terminal
I'll show you if it is empty LS
both folder is empty
now
we'll make a project inside it
will simply write npm
in it iPhone y for all the default
values
press enter
so KFC
the package.json file has been installed
in this package
it is clearance
now the first thing you need to install
is typescript
type npm
PN
to D
this will install the typescript
dependencies
now I will install two more dependencies
please write npm
I
guess if n node
I will also install nodemon
enter
this will install all the dependencies
there will be need in this project
let's clear the screen
now
now we have to install Express
10 pm
install
Express
let's wait for a couple of seconds the
npm express has been created
open the package or decent file here you
see
all the dev dependencies
Express
nodemon and TS node
has been successfully installed
now we need to create a project inside
this folder for that we need to write
npx
okay F1 in it
wait for a couple of seconds here we go
here the screen
now we'll execute npx
hyphen
in it
so it has already been here
you can see
yeah
now we will be creating a source folder
for that
right mpdir
C
enter this would be containing all our
typescript files here
you can see it's empty
let's create a file here
Dot
everything we're going to write is
inside this file only
so you set up for typescript with
Express in node is ready
you can write anything here
the first thing you need is node.js
let's see I have created one for me you
can create it by just entering a command
make directory in the terminal
and entering your folder name it can be
ABC or something you need and like this
it will be created but I don't need it
so I am going to delete it
and this
I will open the terminal again
I'll write a command
npm
in it
what
this will create a Json file for us
like as you can see here
the Json file has been created here
clear the screen
now we will install express.js in this
folder for that write a command in VM
install
Express
and press enter this will install
express.js for us
you can also see here the independencies
Express has been successfully installed
and all other modules are here
so
let's clear this screen now
now we will create a server file here
let's name it app.js
here we'll write all our code
so let's create a simple Express folder
right
const
Express
required
keyword
all over
modules will be here
available
duh
in this we are requiring express.js
now we will also be meeting
quote
processes
dot EnV
y dot port number that will gonna write
here
I'm using port number 3000 you can write
anything
foreign
number now
create an app
you have created an instance for express
now we'll create
it listen to our code
let's write tab Dot listen
port number it will read by its own
a data function
console log
but we are gonna see batik
server
started at http
localhost
dollar sign
to get the data of the port
and we'll write the code it will fetch
the number of the board
here it goes
now we have created a front end of this
I repeat now we will create a front end
of this registration form so let's
create it
okay
the first hit
create a folder
public
in this folder
let's create two files index
dot HTML
and
uh
second one will name as style.css
all right
now in the index folder
we'll write all our front-end code so
open
index.html page
right dog and enter
this will create a HTML template for you
in the title
yes we'll write
registration
um
now in the body part
will write
heading for this
H1
right heading you just
hear the action will be class
foreign
now we'll create a form
function
yeah
class will be formed
now we'll create an input types first
we'll create input type will be
text
will be the right first name
this folder
this username will become inside the
text box this first name
[Music]
now we'll create few more like this for
password
last name age number
let's copy this input
so
first one will be first name second one
will be
last name
so we'll write the email
just
put this
this looks good
okay we will write that email
will write password
placeholder
will write
it will be empty so no one will see our
password this will be an empty
let's read it here
and we'll write
in the placeholder password
let's go to another one
and let's create a first name last name
email password and let's create one more
that will be a
h
for this we have to write here
number
name I guess
let's write it here
page
holder what will see inside this box in
the front end okay
let's create a submit button
type of the button will be submit
so we can
give it styled
Squad
something
so our form is ready
uh yeah
we'll write require here
so
one will be left empty
this will help us to
to require every field because
everything is important
we cannot make it empty so we are
writing required
so
so
our HTML page is ready
here let's see how it looks
open this HTML page
here
a registration form look like this
let me show you what require is doing
as you can see please fill out this
field this is what required function do
submit
is
now coming back to vs code
will write some CSS code for styling
here we will write
padding for the page
will be zero
if we don't have to write percent
margin
we'll also write 0 for the overall page
now we'll go to the
body part
so the
height will be 100
pH
width will be
100 BH
display size will be
legs
in the direction of the flex will be
bottom
right just this icon 10 will be in
Center
and then
items Center
this is how we will
right body part
coming to the
form of this page
form
right
everything will be a single copy this
let's paste it here
I don't want the height of the form in
this much
it could be let's create a 40.
40 percent
width will be 100 only
this place clicks will be here
direction or this will be column only
justify contents
let's see
the to our code
let's make it not Center
let's make it as
this
this let's make it space between
you can style it as your own
as you want
heading
this play will be in line block
this will make our
page registration Page look
morphine
perform
okay
input
foreign
we can do
then passing from this side
and point it okay
and put it okay
now we'll go to
let's do something with the button
button
B
p
padding will be
10 from this
25 on the other side
yes
let's see
the color for this
oh
hello will look like this
it's not an issue
is in
the summit button
uh
box
this will look cool
brown color
of the summit button will be flat
and the text which is inside it will be
right
so it looks clean as a
registration form
it's done
you can also
save this file go to the file
a registration form look like this
isn't it cool
let's make this a little up
The Heading fire drill
your operating for
40 percent
if this is file
go to the form and see
yeah it looks good now
let's see everything is working fine
yeah
coming back to our vs code
now
so our front part is ready if there will
be any changes we'll do it later now
coming back to our backend part
of the registration form will make our
first API routes
here
that's right
add dot get
on
excited
request
response
the other function
let's write here the response that the
form will send
and
in the directory name
of this HTML file
it's right here
direct rename
because
properly
x dot
let's save it
going back to our
68 post method also here
bomb post
and response
will be here
foreign
here in this part it will face the data
in the body of the HTML page
now
let's create an API middleware
that
to use
press dot Json
computation here we are accepting the
data in Json format
after this we will use it again
I've got use
Express
dot URL encoded
function
this is basically to decode the data
sent through HTML form
dot again
this will Express
dot you will write static
starting function will be public folder
public
this will use the public folder for us
now
we'll save this file first
open your HTML file
and write in the form part
itions
here
will declare the file name app.js
form
class form
and we'll write method which will be
closed here
everything looks good we forgot to write
converted commas here
save this file
now open the terminal
and write node
app dot Js
press enter
so our code is running fine let's open
it
yeah
everything looks fine
but to name a few a band developer is
the one who builds an effective website
architecture
who also writes code to communicate with
the database and again as mentioned
ensures data integrity and consistency
now essentially a back-end developer
handles what you don't see they're in
charge of the back end of a website
which includes servers database
applications and so forth
so if you wish to become a back-end
developer you can but there are a few
skills that you need to have
so let's look at the skills that you
need to hone to become a successful
back-end developer
first up is data structures and
algorithms now you must have a good
understanding of data structures and
algorithms understanding how the data is
being stored is crucial
so Concepts like Stacks queues linked
lists sorting and search algorithms are
important
next we have programming languages and
Frameworks
one of the most critical skills of a
back-end developer is the in-depth
knowledge of back-end programming
languages
this includes JavaScript and its
environments like node.js and express.js
Java in particular was built from the
ground up to be run on server side so
popular JavaScript Frameworks like
spring and JSF are also important
moving ahead we have python which is the
most popularly used language now it is
flexible and easy to use so there are
Frameworks like Django and flask again
these are crucial and it's important to
have a good understanding of these
Frameworks
we also have C sharp which is a
preferred architecture for backend
programming so it includes asp.net code
and dotnet MVC now other programming
languages include PHP Pearl and Ruby and
since back-end and front-end developers
work so closely it's also helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end web Technologies like HTML and
CSS
proficiency is required not only for
performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside front-end developers
to develop Solutions
so moving ahead we have Version Control
now Version Control Systems help manage
the project files and keep track of the
entire history of users things
so popular ones are get GitHub and
subversion
now git helps manage the project files
it keeps track of the entire history of
things that the user is working on right
and GitHub is a web-based service for
Version Control using git
moving ahead we have database Management
Systems
now a backend developer writes code that
is used to perform relational mapping to
fetch data from the database so some
popularly used database management
systems are MySQL there's postcode SQL
SQL server and you also have mongodb
and lastly we have web hosting platforms
now web hosting platforms allow you to
deploy your product on a cloud service
provider so it can be accessed from the
World Wide Web
now popular ones are Amazon web services
Google Cloud platform Heroku and
Microsoft azure
now of course a back-end developer
should also possess non-technical skills
like problem solving critical thinking
decent communication practices and
analytical skills now they should be a
debt to working independently as well as
in a collaborative team
now that you're familiar with the skills
let's have a look at the key
responsibilities and roles of a back-end
developer
to begin with rules a back-end developer
could be assigned the following roles
back-end developer Java developer full
stack developer devops engineer software
engineer and iOS Developer
and here is a list of responsibilities
first up
is to form an understanding of the
website's performance needs and goals to
develop effective and efficient
Solutions
development and management of
application programming interfaces
having a good knowledge on programming
and ensuring framework utilization
developing solutions for websites to
accept and store data securely
especially for those involved with
Payment Processing
writing testing and maintaining the
development solutions for code related
issues
effectively communicating with
developers designers and system
administrators and organization of
system logic now it's also crucial to
ensure the development of website
architecture using proper methodologies
like agile scrum and framework
and it's also important to know how to
troubleshoot and debug applications
so now that you're familiar with those
responsibilities and roles
let's have a look at the backend
developer's salary
according to Glassdoor a back-end
developer
in the United States earns around 102
000 US dollars per annum while in India
a back-end developer earns an average
salary of 7 lakhs 23 000 Indian rupees
per annum so now that you're familiar
with back-end development and know what
the roles and responsibilities are
You Must Be Wondering Where to Begin
well look no further you can head to the
official simply learn website and just
search for back-end development a number
of Articles courses and programs will
appear you can also choose the one that
suits you best you can just click on the
program and get an overview of what the
course consists of and depending on your
requirements you can opt for the course
that is most appropriate for you now in
the world of databases the most common
and well popular databases are rdbms
which is relational database Management
Systems now what if you want to develop
an application which deals with the
large volumes of data then we need to
choose one such database which always
provides a high performance data storage
solutions so that we can achieve the
performance in the solution in the terms
of data store and the retrieval with
accuracy speed and reliability now if
you categorize the database Solutions
then there are many two types of
database categories that are available
that is the first one is rdbms like
MySQL SQL server or
Etc and another type is no SQL databases
like mongodb Cosmo DB Cassandra Hadoop
Etc more on that soon but before we get
started if you're new to the channel and
haven't subscribed already consider
getting subscribed to our channel to
stay updated with all the latest
Technologies and hit that Bell icon to
never miss an update from us so without
any further Ado let's get started
firstly let us discuss the agenda for
today's session we'll start the tutorial
with a quick introduction to nosql and
then we'll discuss what exactly is what
is mongodb and then we'll go through the
history of mongodb which is when it when
and how it came into existence and after
that we'll understand why we use mongodb
up next we'll discuss some key Salient
features of mongodb up next we will
discuss how exactly mongodb works and
then we'll go through some different
applications of mongodb in real life and
then we'll see which companies are using
mongodb in current days and finally
we'll understand when to use and when
not to use the mongodb
now before we understand what is mongodb
isn't it is important to learn what is
nosql now under the vast roof of Big
Data there lies a number of databases
which are used to store these massive
amounts of data that is generated
worldwide now one among them which is
attracting a huge number of interest is
the nosql database the not only SQL or
nosql database which is often referred
as with these two terms is an approach
that works towards managing data as well
as the database design which may come in
handy for huge sets of distributed data
it consists of number of Technologies
and architectures that seek a solution
to the Big Data performance issues and
scalability that cannot be addressed by
the relational databases now this
database is used when companies and
Enterprises develop a need to access and
analyze large amounts of unstructured
data or the data stored in multiple
virtual servers in the cloud now there
is no specific definition for what nosql
is but it is a common set of observation
where we can describe that it is not a
relational model that is unlike the
traditional relational databases which
store data in the form of tables which
comprises of rows and columns no SQL
database doesn't store in that way now
in nosql databases also we have a
various types of databases now the first
one is key value database that is it is
a simplest type of nosql database and
every data element in the database is
stored as a key value pair consisting of
an attribute name or key and a value so
in a sense a key value stored is like a
relational database with only two
columns the key or attribute name such
as anything like state ID or name and
the values such as let's say a country
name India so that is one of a nosql
database and next we have column based
or column oriented databases now while a
relational database stores data in rows
and reads data row by row a column store
is organized as a set of columns this
means that when you want to run
analytics on a small number of columns
you can read those columns directly
without consuming memory with The
Unwanted data
and of course we have the document type
of database the concept that is focused
on in document databases the documents
that are stored and received from the
database store can be like a Json or a
Json or an XML format now these
documents are usually similar to each
other and are in a hierarchical free
data structure that are self-describing
and consists of scalar values Maps
Collections and Etc
and finally we do have graph databases
guys now a graph database focuses on the
relationship between data elements now
each data element is stored as a node
and the connections between elements are
called links or relationships in a graph
database connections of first class
elements of the database taught directly
now in relational databases link links
are implied using data to express the
relationship now these were some of the
mainly used nosql database guys but in
this tutorial we'll be only focusing on
the document database and which is one
of the most commonly used no SQL
databases out there and the best example
is mongodb and apart from mongodb we do
have other document databases like couch
base nosql database as well now that
we've understood what is a nosql
databases Let Us Now quickly understand
what is mongodb
mongodb is an open source document
oriented or a non-relational database
now it is different than traditional
relational databases like post to SQL
MySQL or SQL Server because it stores
the data in json-like documents instead
of tables and it is primarily is used to
store large volumes of data in the form
of documents
now traditional relational databases
stored data using tables and rows right
mongodb on the other hand is a
non-relational database which has
collections instead of tables now
documents are stored inside the
collections in where rows are
stored in tables in traditional
relational databases now with mongodb
the biggest Advantage is the structure
and scheme of your data is flexible and
not enforced by a predefined table
definition unlike relational databases
where you have to specify the schema
that is the structure of the table the
attributes and the values in it now
documents can vary greatly in size and
shape within the same collection whereas
tables are more rigidly defined in a
relational database so when you are
using mongodb it represents hierarchy
relationship in a single record instead
of joining multiple tables so that is
the main difference between a relational
database and a non-relational database
and mongodb being a nosql database
follows the a document data model which
is a collection of complex documents
which arbitrary nested data formats and
varying records formats now because
mongodb does not store data in a
structured table format you cannot query
it using SQL instead mongodb uses a more
flexible and a dynamic query language
called specific carries which is
based on JavaScript which we'll be
discussing in a certain way
all right I hope you understood what is
mongodb let us now go to the history of
mongodb guys now it is also important
that when and how mongodbs came into
existence even though we have several
relational databases in the market
now mongodb was first introduced in 2007
tangent software company began
developing mongodb in 2007 as a
component of a planned platform as a
service product so from 2000 to 7 to
2008 it was developed and it was working
as a platform as a service product
now in 2009 the company shifted to an
open source development model with the
company offering commercial support and
other services so from 2009 since it
became an open source the users can
directly download it from the internet
in 2013 tangent changed its name to
mongodb Inc and it is working under the
same Banner on October 20 2017 mongodb
became a publicly listed traded company
on NASDAQ as amdb with an IPO price of
24 dollars per share now mongodb is a
global company with U.S headquarters in
New York City and international
headquarters in Dublin and has more than
110 million download and regular users
in the current times and the latest
version of it was released in 2022 which
is 6.0
let us now understand why mongodb is
used guys now since mongodb is a nosql
database we need to understand when and
why we need to use it uh in real life as
well now since a normal circumstances
mongodb always preferred by the
developers when our main concern is to
deal with larger huge volumes of data
with a high performance so if you want
to insert thousands of thousands of
Records in a second then mongodb is the
best choice for that now also one of the
main reason is to overcome the
limitation of relational databases or
like the structured query language guys
where the language is only used for
certain
databases offer limited records right so
in order to overcome that we use mongodb
since it is a robust and highly scalable
and it is also powerful way of storing
data in comparison to traditional
databases
now it is also highly flexible which
allows you to store and work on
different data types in one document
whereas in relational database you store
data in tables and you have to maintain
a proper schema for that so you need to
join multiple tables if you want to
retrieve certain amounts of data and
mongodb also provides a lot of security
and it is also considered as a powerful
query language as well
now as discussed earlier mongodb allows
the user with flexible schema that means
it allows you to meet the ever-changing
conditions characteristics of Big Data
applications if you are working on
massive amounts of data on a regular
basis and also it gives you high
performance with its incredible features
like on-demand scaling real-time
resources which will guarantee the user
high performance of the applications let
us now discuss some of the key features
of mongodb now the first one is
aggregation now you might have heard
about aggregation in SQL as well now
data records are processed by
aggregation which is grouping of data
which then produces the competed results
or into a single result now in simple
words aggregation operations group
values from multiple documents in
mongodb database together and can
perform a variety of operations on the
grouped data to return a single result I
said earlier it is similar to that of
SQL Group by Clause where we use
aggregation functions like average sum
minimum Max and others
next we have the grid FS now grid FS is
a specification for storing and
retrieving files that exceed the base on
document size limit of 16 MB now instead
of storing a file in a single document
grid FS divides a file into parts or
which is called as chunks and stores
each of those chunks as a separate
document Now by default grid FS limits
trans size to 255 KV now it uses two
collections to store files so it is also
another important feature of mongodb now
next we have sharding now in mongodb uh
it uses sharding and replication which
are another key factors sharding allows
partitioning of data across multiple
servers using the shared key and the
technique of synchronizing all these
organized data across many servers to
offer redundancy is known as replication
now next we have document oriented as we
all know that mongodb is a document
oriented type of a database there are
different documents to store different
types of data and each document has a
unique system generated key the
application I think we have already
discussed and also our mongodb is a
schema-less database that is it stores
data in collections with no enforced
schema so in other words incoming data
can have a predefined structure and it
can alert to it however different
documents in the same collection can
have different structures if required
indexing is also another key feature of
mongodb which is one of the most
important options to improve the search
query performance now as a result we
should index the fields that fit our
search criteria like without indexing
mongodb it has to scan every document of
the collection to get the required
result that matches the query statement
right so in order to eliminate that we
need to provide indexing for a faster
query retrieval
next we have ADD our queries now in most
cases while designing a database schema
we don't know what queries we'll run
ahead of time right so when we design
our database we may not be knowing uh
the query types of the data that we
process into our database so ad hoc
query is the query not known while
structuring the data or you can say that
ADA queries are short-lived uh queries
whose value depends on variables so
mongodb supports these types of queries
and can buy also update in real time and
finally high performance performance
means writing speed performance of
mongodb is far greater than any other
relational database like MySQL those
were some of the key features of mongodb
so let us now understand how exactly
mongodb Works guys mongodb stores data
objects in collections and documents
instead of the traditional tables and
rows which is used in our relational
databases now collections comprise sets
of documents which are equivalent to
tables and relational database now
documents consist of a key value pair
which are basic unit of data in mongodb
now the structure of a document can be
changed by simply adding a new fields or
deleting existing ones now documents can
define a primary key as a unique
identifier and values can be a variety
of data types including the other
documents and the array of documents so
it is basically uh works on a JavaScript
query which is Json
and it is further classified into base
one which is a binary encoded object
notation so if you look at the picture
in this we have basically a host which
uh
ultimately has a server which stores the
data and further we have databases
wherein we have different Collections
and in collections we have documents so
the data is stored in this documents
which is further presented into the
collections and are saved into databases
so this is roughly how exactly mongodb
works let us now discuss some
applications of mongodb in real life as
well guys now one of the main
application is iot or Internet of things
which is one of the most appreciated
technology Innovations in the world
today connecting billions of devices
globally now with iot companies improve
productivity redefine their models and
leverage operational efficiency so
mongodb helps to maximize this full
potential of iot devices its intelligent
data platform which speeds up the
operation and delivery of iot devices it
is also extensively used in mobile
applications because with the data that
is being generated like for example in
social media in Internet we need mongodb
to handle such amounts of our data right
so it is also used in real time analysis
now with rdbms databases analytics and
transactional databases were usually
separate and data from the transactional
database would have to be moved to
analytics and one environment which
requires an immense daily data load now
with nosql databases like mongodb
companies can now analyze data in real
time while saving cost for example if
you take stock market we have tons or
trillions amounts of data has been
generated every day so again in sports
as well which is a real-time data
analysis to get the Insight we need the
data in a quick and faster manner so in
that case we can use mongodb as well
mongodb is also perfect for catalog
management content management as well as
product data management guys it enables
product data or the content related
information to be managed and processed
in a single Central system this allows
for detailed cost analysis increase
productivity gain new insights and
improve collaboration with the companies
as well so one of the best example if I
take is the other card guys it is a real
world mongodb use case where other is a
India's unique identification project
and world's most extensive biometric
database system now we know that it was
I think it was launched into early 2010s
and it has collected demographic and
biometric information of over 1.5
billion people in India so other mostly
relies on mongodb among other databases
like hbase MySQL Hadoop which basically
runs on massive amounts of data which
process huge amount of data in a real
time
so mongodb was one of the database
systems for purchase to power the search
strategy of other card all right let us
now discuss some of the companies which
are using mongodb in real life uh guys
so companies like Google Facebook Bosch
eBay are some of the companies which
have extensively used mongodb nowadays
and apart from that we have other
companies like you know Toyota Cisco
Adobe essay
Verizon and other service and product
based companies use mongodb on a regular
basis now apart from this we have
Shutterfly we have MetLife we even have
Forbes which use mongodb on a regular
basis
and that brings us to the end of today's
session guys now before we uh wrap up
the session it is also important that
you need to understand when you should
be using mongodb and when you shouldn't
now although mongodb is a great database
out there there are times you shouldn't
and you should use in certain uh
circumstances now mongodb works
extensively well with unstructured data
so it's great for uh big data analytic
systems so if you're working on huge
chunks of data which needs in a
real-time processing immediately then
you can use mongodb mongodb is also used
for cloud computing like Microsoft Azure
AWS which is an ideal cloud computing
platform uh for mongodb because
cloud-based storage needs to easily
distribute data across multiple servers
and which basically suits mongodbs
nature
now if you do not have any database
administrator in that case you you might
as well use mongodb as well now wherein
you have lots of unstructured data to
process and which has no storable data
type limits so in that case you can use
mongodb and finally if you have schema
issues that is if you have an unstable
or undefined schema you can use mongodb
which is not with the case of
traditional database which requires a
predefined schema before you start
working on the database
now since it's already installed on my
system uh the installation process will
be different but you just need to follow
the steps there and finally install it
so once you're done with the
installation you can go to your C drive
and here you can click on program files
and you can see that mongodb is
installed and inside of it you have the
server folder and then you have the 4.4
folder and then you have the bin folder
right so here you have the application
that is your and the mongod
applications both are executable files
now the D file or the application
is the daemin process now this is the
background process that makes sure you
retrieve the data from the database
access the data so it does all the
background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just
go to our environment variables
but before that let's just uh
copy this path
right
and here under the user variable section
click on path and say edit and go ahead
and just paste it right I've already
pasted mine so just go ahead and paste
it and click on OK
and
say okay right so now you've created the
path successfully now let's head to our
Command Prompt and run the file so
here you can just directly type
since the path has already been created
so just go ahead and say
[Music]
and here you can see that your
server has been generated
and with this you know that you're in
mongodb has been successfully installed
and your server is up and running right
so just for confirmation let's see if
there are any databases and how much
space they've occupied so you can right
now just type show DBS
[Music]
and when you click on it it says admin
config and localhost and all of it is
zero so with that you have successfully
installed mongodb on your system and
it's up and running
all right now in contrast to structured
query language or SQL databases which is
a relational database model where the
structure of the database and its tables
have been defined mongodb does not have
or required the definition of a database
or a table structure instead we use data
models in order to store the documents
in our database more on that soon but
before we get started if you're new to
the channel and haven't subscribed
already consider getting subscribed to
our Channel simply code to stay updated
with all the tech content so moving
ahead let us now first discuss the
agenda for today's session we'll start
the tutorial by understanding what is
data modeling and then we'll understand
why we use data modeling after that
we'll be going through how data modeling
actually works in mongodb and next we'll
understand different types of data
models in mongodb up next we'll discuss
types of relationships and data models
and then we'll see some methods to
create these data models and finally
we'll understand when to use these data
models as per our requirement so without
any further delay let's get started with
today's topic all right so what is data
modeling in mongodb now basically data
modeling is a process of taking
unstructured data that is generated from
The Real World scenario and introducing
it to the data server and then
structuring it into a logical data model
in our database so it is basically a
process of determining how data is
stored and what connection exists
between various entities in a
relationship now you don't have to
create a schema before inserting data
because nosql is flexible this is so
that mongodb can support a dynamic
database schema that makes it
unnecessary to create your schema in
advance instead you can now store your
information and make changes in
accordance with your data now consider
data modeling in mongodb as a
relationship now there is no particular
relationship just like a SQL where we
use Now mongodb relationships are the
representations of how multiple
documents are logically connected to
each other in mongodb now since mongodb
is a document database any document
within the same collection is not
mandatory to have same set of fields or
structure you can store different types
in a collections given field and can
even add new Fields update fields and
delete existing Fields as well now for
example consider an online shopping
store where we have like thousands of
customers arriving daily and purchasing
new products from the website now we get
a lot of unstructured data that is the
name of the customer the details and all
which is basically an unstructured data
now in order to convert into a proper
structured data we need to model them
into a particular way which this is
where data modeling comes into a picture
where we store the data based upon our
requirement now the main challenge in
data modeling is balancing the
application needs guys now the database
engines performance characteristics and
also the data retrieving patterns
all right let us now move ahead and
understand why we use data modeling
now data model basically helps us to
create a simplified and optimized
logical database that eliminates
redundancy red is a storage requirements
and enables efficient retrieval from the
database now data modeling may appear to
be a complex process wherein you have to
make adjustments to your database unlike
SQL value predefine your schema and
create a new table and then store the
data now while in mongodb data modeling
helps us to analyze and understand what
type of data and how much data has to be
inserted into a database data modeling
is necessary foundational work that
allows data to be stored more easily in
the database and has a positive positive
impact on data analytics as well now let
us understand why exactly we use now
data modeling now data quality is
Paramount for any organization and to
ensure that we need higher data quality
when we are showing unstructured data in
large amounts now the representation of
requirements and the business rules
enables to anticipate what could lead to
a large-scale data corruption before it
occurs so data model enables the
developers in hindsight to Define rules
that monitor the data quality and
ensuring that there is no possibility of
errors
now it is also important to understand
how the data is Flowing within the
database and the characteristics of that
creating data models forces the business
to Define how data is generated and move
across the application
development and maintenance data
modeling exposes errors and
inconsistencies early in the process
making is it making it easier and less
expensive to fix so in order to maintain
a database that is a mongodb database
which is basically a unstructured one it
is important that we try to develop and
maintain it in a regular basis
and finally performance is another
reason why we use data modeling now an
organized database is one that is more
efficiently operated and data modeling
prevents the schema from endless
searching and returns results more
quickly those were some of the reasons
on why we use data modeling is
all right let us now move and discuss
how data modeling Works in mongodb
now unlike SQL databases where you must
determine and declare a table schema
before inserting data or perform any
operations we need to basically provide
a schema for that now mongodb's
collection by default do not require the
documents to have the same schema now
the documents in a single collection do
not need to have the same set of fields
and the data type of for a field can
differ across documents within a
collection now to change the structure
of the document in a collection such as
adding a new field or removing the
existing field in a document or changing
a field values to a new type or update
the documents to the new structure
now basically the first step is to
basically create and design a schema as
per the requirement and the application
made by the user and then we have to
combine documents now if there is no
scope for multiple documents uh to store
into a single one and ensure that if
there is no other need for a single
document to store in a multiple document
in such way we need to understand what
is our requirement and combine the
documents accordingly so that we can
have performance as well as the
optimization of the database is also
improved now this flexibility
facilitates the mapping of documents to
an entity or an object now each document
can match the data field of a
represented ID entity even if the
document has substantial variation from
other documents in the collection so
this is how basically a data model Works
wherein you have to choose as per the
requirement and understand what type of
documents that are being inserted into
the database
all right let us now understand some
data models that are used in mongodb now
once you've understood the business
requirement and the application on how
it should be as you start modeling your
data you will likely go through various
steps of data analysis now each step
might produce different types of data
models therefore ensuring data models
having the right one can be generally
thought of as being one of the main
aspect of choosing a data model and they
are conceptualized into three categories
based on the level of the detail and the
specificity now that's classified into
three types the first one is conceptual
data model the conceptual data model
explains what the system should contain
with regard to and how it is related
this model is usually built with the
help of the user and the stakeholders it
represents the applications business
logic and is often used as the basis for
one or more following model
next we have the logical data model Now
The Logical data model will describe how
the data will be structured in this
model the relationship between the
entities is established at a high level
you'll also list the attributes for the
entities represented in this model
and finally we have the physical data
model guys the physical data model
represents how the data will be stored
in a specific database now in this case
we have mongodb model where we are using
establishing a primary and a secondary
relationship between the data in a
document that is stored in the database
such as mongodb you will also establish
the data types for each of your fields
that are mentioned this will provide you
with your database schema as well
foreign
mongodb has a flexible schema you need
to uh data model or schema design a good
data model means that you'll establish a
strong foundation for an Ever evolving
data model now mongodb supports multiple
ways to model relationship between the
entities in a data model now the first
one is one to one that is in this type
one value is associated with only one
document that is it will have a single
relationship between the two connected
objects or entities in the database next
we have one to many here one value can
be associated with more than one
document or value at the same time and
finally we have many too many now when
two or more entities within a document
can have multiple relationship that is
basically is many to many relationships
in this type of model multiple documents
can be associated with each other so let
us now quickly understand with an
example now consider the example for one
to one relationship where I have a
student table and contact info table now
for each student ID there is a unique
details or the contact info so it is
basically pointing one value to another
that is student ID which is one to one
relation and similarly we have one too
many relation wherein we have customer
table and Order stable now every
customer has a different ID and a
customer can place multiple orders so it
can generate multiple order IDs so we
have three different IDs like b204 b391
b448 so this is what is one two mini
which is basically one entity is being
pointed to three other values I hope you
understood one to one and one too many
so if you understood this let us know in
the comment section below what will be a
good example of many to many
relationship
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of methods to create
the data models now once we are
confirmed with what data model we need
and the relationship that we have chosen
for uh for our documents to store the
data we need a method that is to create
a data model now that is where we have
two different data models that stores
the data in documents that is first one
is embedded data model so in emitted
data model you can embed data in a
single document or structure in mongodb
it is also referred to as the normalized
data model it leverages the full
potential of mongodbs Rich document and
it uses a one to one or one-to-many
relationship guys
next we have the reference data model or
in other words it is known as normalized
data model now they are used to build
one too many as well as many too many
relationship models now while working
with the embedded document models there
will be times when you have to repeat
the data this is where reference data
model comes into picture which basically
tackles their data redundancy
so I know it is bit of confusing so
let's just understand this with an
example here now if you consider the
embedded model if you look at a document
which I have taken here which is the
details of a student named Rohan where
we have a collection uh that is
containing a document has Rohan in this
document we have embedded a document
here that is contact details and his
grade
so embedding uh data model stores
relevant details in the same documents
or the same database record this way you
can minimize queries and update required
to perform common database operation on
the other hand we have a reference data
model or the normalized data model
so if you look at to the reference model
example here we have basically split the
single document into three documents and
since contact details and grade have the
ID from the document that is of rohans
you can call them whenever needed now
normalized data model splits the data
into multiple collections by using
references between the newer collections
you can update or change a single
document which will update other
collections automatically this is an
efficient way of updating data and is
mostly used when your data goes through
frequent changes that is if you're
working on a data that has to be
leveraged or changed on a daily basis
you can consider reference model
that is which is basically one of the
biggest advantages of using normalized
data where you have to model large data
sets that follow a certain hierarchy and
you have to where you have to represent
multiple many-to-many relationships so
that is where we use uh embedded model
and reference model uh as we know
mongodb is a nosql database program that
controls document oriented data instead
of a relational data made the original
data model which comprises of rows and
columns now the speed of mongodb is one
of its characteristics as it handles a
huge chunks of unstructured data so in
order to perform a certain operation
mongodb may use operators to carry out
particular tasks in order to return
queries more quickly and efficiently so
in today's session we'll be taking you
through all about the mongodb operators
what are they the different types of
mongodb operators that I use its
functions with the help of some examples
so without any further Ado let's get
started so what is mongodb operators
operators are basically special symbols
or keywords that tell a compiler what
mathematical or logical operations to
perform the operator improves mongodb
functionality by enabling the developers
and programmers to construct
sophisticated queries to communicate
with data sets that are appropriate for
their application and perform certain
complex tasks to retrieve the data now
in general we use the find command or
method to fetch the data from
collections using the query operator
also we need to use the prefix which is
the dollar sign before the query
operator so let us just quickly
understand the syntax of the operators
in mongodb the syntax is followed as DB
dot name of collection dot find and
within the parenthesis
we have to mention the field name and
mention the semicolon and then we have
to mention the dollar symbol with the
help of the operator that we want to use
mention the value and finally we use the
pretty uh method so let us just quickly
uh go through all this uh terminology so
that will have a better idea now the
name of the collection is basically
according to the query operator we used
in our query this parameter is defined
as the collection name from which
documents have been retrieved next we
have the find method now data can be
retrieved from collections using this
technique we can also retrieve
particular documents from mongodb by
using the find method with a query
operator next we have this field name
according the query parameter we used in
our query this parameter is defined as
the name of the field from which we are
retrieving data that is what we are
trying to uh retrieve data from our
collection is basically the field name
next we have the query operator name
which must be used to retrieve the
documents from The Collection accordance
with the query operations next we have
to mention the value the value is
nothing more than the field value that
we used with a query operator to conduct
logical or any mathematical operations
and so on and finally we have an option
well uh tag which is pretty now since
mongodb output is generally is in an
unstructured format so we can display
our output using this technique in a
structure format and this is also
optional guys so if there is a
requirement to show the data in a proper
structure where you can use the pretty
uh statement so that was all about
mongodb operators guys so let us just
move ahead so let us now understand the
different types of operators in mongodb
now just like any operators in other
programming languages mongodb operators
are used to perform specific relational
mathematical or logical operations and
produce this final result operators in
mongodb are you know broadly classified
into three types the first one is query
and projection operator next we have
update operator and then finally we have
aggregation pipeline operator
now in mongodb the default for queries
is to return all the fields in the
matching documents so basically a query
and a projection operator is used to
perform certain calculation wherein a
projection query is used to specify or
restrict the data result returned in
query result Now by specifying a
projection query you can specify the
fields you want to return or exclude now
similarly we have other query operators
which we'll be discussing in a while
which are used to perform certain a
complex calculation on the data that you
are retrieving from the documents next
we have the update operator which
basically updates the value of all the
fields of the documents which is
matching the specified condition and
finally we have the aggregation pipeline
so it basically provides a competent
results as a result of processing the
data requires an document so it is
similar to that of aggregate functions
in SQL wherein it you know Aggregates
all the values within a document and
perform certain aggregation uh operation
like you know some Maximum minimum and
so on so these are some of the main uh
different types of operators in mongodb
so let us now just uh get into detail
and how that further classified into
various types now query and projection
operator further classified into various
other types such as comparison operator
logical operator array operator element
Operator bitwise Operator evaluation
operator and finally we have geospatial
operator now it is time taking to get
into all of this stuff and explain each
and every operator guys so let us just
focus on the main operators that are
frequently used in mongodb
so firstly let us discuss about the
comparison operator guys now the
comparison operators are basically used
to compare to expressions and retrieve
data from the documents that is the
documents that are that we have stored
uh that is the all the data from the
collections which are basically the
group of collections is basically a
document in mongodb that is stored in
the mongodb database now we have several
such comparison operators in mongodb now
as explained earlier we have to use the
dollar sign with the help of operator
that we have been uh mentioning so
basically The Operators are take the
dollar sign and then we have to mention
the operator that we have taken so let
us just discuss some of the operators
here the first one is EQ which is
basically the equal operator which
matches values that are equal to the
value specified in the query next we
have dollar any which has a full form of
not equal to which is opposite of equal
and matches all the values that are not
equal to the value specified in the
query next we have GT and GT which is
basically greater than and greater than
equals to uh this operator basically
matches the value that are greater than
the value specified in the query or that
are even greater than or equal to the
various value specified in the query
next we have the LT or LTE that is less
than or less than equals to again as the
uh the word course it is similar again
it matches the values that are less than
the value specified in the query or it
matches with the less than or equal
values specified in the query in the
document and finally we have the in and
nin
which basically matches any of the value
that is existing or not existing in an
array specified in bigquery I know it is
a bit of confusing so let us just uh
understand this with an example here so
consider this example on your right hand
side where you can see this image which
is basically a format of a document that
is stored in a mongodb database guys so
let us say I have uh you know a
collection named orders of let's say a
stationary item database now I have
further different three different
documents that are present in
uh this collection so basically a group
of documents is basically a collection
in a mongodb database so I hope you've
understood uh what is a collection
document and what is a database so if
you want to know more about it we have a
dedicated video on what is momotb where
we've uh explained clearly on all these
terms and how it exactly Works make sure
you check that out uh which will be
quite helpful and I would highly
recommend so as you can see we have
basically three documents here we have a
ID of three different uh people who have
purchased certain products from a
stationary and have different IDs so we
have three customers here Rahul prenup
and kirti now if I say if I want to
perform comparison operation for this uh
let us just understand how equal and not
equal operation performs so basically uh
I'm taking an example here which says
dp.orders DOT fine where payment mode is
equals to card so basically uh the
compiler finds all the documents that is
present in this college action where the
payment mode is made through card which
instead of cash so basically we have
here uh the details of two customers who
have used their payment models card
which is customer Rahul and customer
kirti so in this way it will return
these two uh following documents and
similarly we have any which is not equal
to and I'm taking another example which
is DB dot orders fine order total is not
equals to 600. now as you can see in the
image we have the third document of
customer care P whose order total is 600
right so it basically evaluates this and
Returns the result which has an order
total which is not equals to 600 that is
basically the first two documents that
is it will retrieve the data from this
document of the first uh you know two
documents which is of customer Rahul and
customer prenup whose order total is
basically 2450 and 5800 respectively so
that is basically what is a comparison
operator using EQ and any which is equal
to or not equals to All Right Moving
ahead let us now discuss what is GT and
GTA which basically derived as greater
than and greater than equals to again
let us consider the same uh you know
collection same example that we have
taken earlier now the first query is
basically a first GT that is DP Dodge
order find order total is greater than
three thousand
all right so we are basically performing
a search query wherein we want only uh
those documents whose order total is
greater than three thousand now if you
look at the image we have only uh I
guess one document which is of customer
pranav whose order total is 5800 which
is more than 3000 and similarly we have
for greater than equals to which is DB
dot orders fine order total GTE uh 2450.
so basically we should retrieve the
document whose order total is more than
250. again we have two documents here
right now we have a document of customer
Rahul and the customer pranav whose
order total is 2450 which is equals to
2450 for that we have mentioned in our
query so basically uh the details of the
documents of customer Rahul and customer
pranav whose order total is greater than
or equals to 24 500. all right moving
ahead let us now understand what is LT
and LP which is a negation or complete
opposite is greater than greater uh than
equals to now in less than we have taken
an example which is again order total
Which is less than 2000 uh so I guess we
have only one record again here of
customer kirti whose order total is 600
and similarly less than or equals to 500
now I guess we have only one document
again of kirti which is order total is
600. oh I'm sorry are less than or
equals to 500 right so we don't have any
uh you know document of the customers
Which is less than or equal to 500 guys
sorry are just a pardon me for my
mistake item check so we don't have any
customers whose order total is less than
or equals to 500 so it will basically uh
you know retrieve a null value
so that were some examples of comparison
Operator Let us move ahead with logical
operators now so basically logical
operators return data based on the
expression that evaluate the following
condition to either be true or false now
in general we have four different types
of logical operators in mongodb which is
and or not and not which is again
similar uh with any other programming
languages where we use a logical
operator and similar to that of SQL as
well now the basically the and operator
returns all the documents that match the
condition of both the expression
specified and or operator returns all
documents that match the condition of
either expression specified next we have
the nor operator which returns all
documents that do not match the
condition of either expression this is
basically an opposite of or operator and
finally we have the not operator which
basically returns documents that does
not match with the query expression in a
document so again let's just understand
with an example by considering the same
example which is the order collection
now for first example I am taking and
operator which says DB dot orders fine
and address city is either daily or
payment mode is cash now if I look into
the uh collection here I have only one
such document where City address city is
Delhi and payment mode is cash that is
the details of customer pranav so it
will retrieve only the document of
pranav here next if I consider the r
operator which is DB dot orders fine or
CT Jaipur or order total is less than or
equals 200 so we have jpur uh City whose
uh I think it's of customer uh Jaipur
yeah it's of customer Rahul so it will
retrieve that one and it will also
retrieve those documents whose order
total is less than or equals two
thousand now we have only one document
of kirti whose order total is 600 which
is again less than or equals to 100 so
basically the first document and the
third document will be retrieved in our
query in a final resultant set and
finally we have the nor operator which
says this city is either is not either
daily or payment mode is cache now other
than CT daily
and the payment mode cache that is we
have a pranav whose payment mode is cash
and also belongs to Siri so basically it
will remove the document of this person
customer
and it will fetch the first and third
documents that is uh the I the customer
rahul's and the customer kirti
so those were some of the uh logical
operator examples we have used I hope
you've understood
so moving ahead let us now discuss some
element operators guys the element query
operators are basically used to locate
document I know based uh on the fields
of the document
now what that I mean is so basically
every document has a field right now for
example let's say in the previous
example I've taken ID customer name
order total and so on and so which is
basically a field I know these field
have further values or elements to its
name right so the element operator
basically uh finds all the documents
based on the fields of the document that
you are trying to search for now we have
basically two uh element operator which
is exists and types exist operator
basically returns documents that have a
specific field now if I let let us take
an example let's say I have an uh you
know collection employees and I want to
find the employee age as a field I want
to find if there is a field called
employees and his age is greater than or
equals to 35 so I have taken this
example which is DB dot employees fine
employee age exists true gt35 so if
there is any field in our collection of
employees and this greater than 25 or
greater than 35 it will retrieve those
documents and similarly we have the type
document type operator which returns
documented field is of only a specific
type specified type now uh if I take an
example here let's say if I'm trying to
find a field uh employee age again and
it is of double uh double integer type
so if I want the particular you know
field data type I can use the type
operator here so this was that was all
about element operator guys and let us
move ahead and finally discuss one of
the main us operator that is array
operators array operators in mongodb are
basically used to query documents that
include a field of arrays now we
basically again have three different
types of operators used in mongodb
the first one is all operator it returns
documents from a collection if it
matches all the values in the specified
array next we have this size operator it
returns documents from The Collection to
match an array with a provided number of
elements in it next and finally we have
LM match which returns those documents
that match specified condition within
each array element now I hope I know it
is bit of confusing so let us just move
ahead and understand with an example
here consider the same uh example again
where we have three documents here now
for first example I have taken the all
operator which is an array operator so
what I'm trying to find is I am trying
to find a element of value which has you
know a notebook and a paper so the query
is followed as DB dot order dot find
orders item all notebook and paper so if
you look into the image I think we have
only uh two documents where we have this
fields are having notebook and a paper
that is the first customer and second
customer if you look into the item name
you have notebook and paper in the first
uh document and second document also we
have item name notebook and paper so it
will retrieve these two documents and
next we have this size so the size
basically retrieve the number of array
elements that you want in your resultant
set now the queries followed as DB dot
order DOT fine where order items is of
size 4. now if you look into three all
the three documents that are present
here we have only one such document
where it has four elements now if you
look at the first document of customer
Rahul order items we have four different
uh you know fields that is he has placed
an order on Notebook play Paper General
and postcard now in contrast if you look
at to the other two uh
documents where we have only notebook
paper and postcard for pranoff and we
have only notebook and postcard for
kirti so which is against or which does
not satisfy the size operator so it
basically retrieves only the first one
which has four elements or Fields so I
think that was all about the array
operators guys I hope you uh understood
about all the query and projection
operators and it's different types now
again we have uh several many operators
like geospat DL uh comment operator and
so many but which are not that
significant in its usage but anyways if
you want us to cover uh in our further
tutorials let us know wherein will try
to cover a more uh you know detailed
version of it with a hands-on experience
with the mongodb database as well
and finally let us discuss uh what is
upgrade operator guys and basically
mongodb offers a variety of field update
operators to update the values of the
fields and documents matching the
specified condition so it is basically
similar to that of your DML command
which is an update command which is used
to used to update the values in the
columns now similarly in mongodb there
might be a possibility that you have to
update some values and that is where we
have the update field operators now
there are again various such of update
operators so let us just go in through
one by one we have first one as current
date which is used to set the value of a
field to current date either a date or a
timestamp next we have Inc which is
basically increment it is used to
increment the value of the field by the
specified amount next we have the Min
and Max which is used to update the
field if the specified value is less
than the existing field value or it is
greater than the existing field value
next we have the mul which is uh a full
form of multiply it is used to multiply
the value of the field by the specified
amount and finally we have the rename as
a name suggests this operator is used to
rename a field within a document
so that was all about the operators in
mongodb guys I think we have got most
almost all the important operators that
are used frequently on a general basis I
think these are quite enough for you to
perform all the complex operation that
you undertake or to retrieve certain uh
you know documents or values in your
database now projection in mongodb is a
special type of feature guys that is
used to select only a certain part of
the data without selecting the entire
data present inside the document so more
on that soon but before we get started
uh let's discuss the agenda for today's
session
which are the tutorial by understanding
what is moreover DB projection and then
we will understand why we use projection
and more and after that we'll have a how
projection Works in mongodb done its
syntax usage and next we'll discuss
projection queries with the help of
certain examples and finally we'll
execute those examples in mongodb server
I hope I made myself clear with the
agenda right what is mongodb projection
now mongodb projection helps to return
specific fields from the query or you
can say from The mongodb Collection Now
by this
collection in mongodb
documents
so as you you know mongodb is a schema
LS database which is a nosql database
and has a different structure to that of
relational database now the tables in
relational database are called as
collection rows are called columns okay
we may not want all the records from the
collection but a few of them in the
resultant set so in that case we use
mongodb projection using projection
document which is used to limit the
amount or fields in the data present in
that document so in a nutshell if I
would say projection means selecting
only then
necessary data
other than select
in the whole of the data present in the
document now similarly after that of
where conditional Clause that we use in
SQL because if I have a document which
has 10 fields and you need to solution
and why we use a popular nosql and open
source document oriented database which
allows for highly scalable and flexible
document structure which is faster than
relational database because of its
efficient storage and indexing
techniques and being a nosql database it
is designed to handle large amounts of
data so DB will process a lot of
unnecessary data and you want when you
want to retrieve specific information
from a large number of Records so to
overcome this problem we use projection
query now some of the reasons Now when
using projection to remove unused or any
sales the military server will have to
fetch each document into its memory and
then filter the results to return
actually reduce the memory usage but can
save the significant network band for
query results depending on the data
model and the fields projected in your
documents and it only returns indexed
query results without fetching the full
documents now which is basically the
main use case of projection which
basically eliminates all the fields that
are unnecessary for the user and
particular Fields within the document
then he can use the production area
operator
and finally data without the overall
database is performance now
by default is return all fields and
matching documents so if all the details
it's returning
full dominance is going to be more
efficient having a server manipulate the
result projection however then to
reprove performance and that is one of
the main uh consideration when we are
using mongodb projection so these are
some of the reasons on why we use
mongodb projection all right let us now
understand how mongodb projection works
now in general to retrieve the data from
the uh documents we use the find method
uh which retrieves data from all the
fields within a document without any
filtering so let us now understand the
syntax of mongodb projection operator
now the syntax is followed as DB dot
collection name DOT fine and within the
hypothesis mention the field names that
is I'm taking your field one and its
corresponding value field 2 and value 2.
now
the values that I'm talking about is if
field value is as 1 which is a Boolean
expression uh which is equals to us it
will basically show the data in that
field field value is if the Boolean
expected hides the data in the field so
let us understand this with an example
guys I the only then you will get a
clear understanding of it now I have
let's say a collection of uh certain
documents let's say the collection name
is orders and I have three such
documents here which has various Fields
like ID customer address payment mode
email order total and Order items now if
I want to display all these documents uh
what I'll do I'll basically write a
query using the find method which is
followed as DB dot orders DOT fine so it
will basically retrieve all the
documents without restricting any of the
fields that are present in our
collection
now let's say if I want only particular
CL that I want to display in my
resultant cell now let's say if I have
uh the payment mode and the order total
sealed and I want only them to display
in the resultant set without displaying
all the fields that are present in each
of the document so in that case I'll
write a query as DB dot orders dot find
and inside the parenthesis I'll mention
payment mode colon 1 and order total is
one now since I've set the field value
to 1 it will only retrieve those values
and similarly for order total also it
will retrieve only that particular field
value so this will basically be the
output of our resultant set that is it
will show the ID object the payment mode
of the three documents and similarly the
order total of the three documents Now
by default we have the underscore ID
which is a default value which we cannot
change it so if if at all if you want to
override and change it you can mention
it to 0 now let's say uh I'm taking the
same example here now instead of just
writing payment mode to 1 and order
total to one I'm adding another uh you
know constraint or I'm using I'm
projecting another field which is of ID
and I'm setting it to zero now if you've
seen a result and set we do not have the
ID field so in this way you can use
projection in order to restrict certain
fields from your resultant table set
without actually retrieving all the data
that is present in your documents so let
us now jump into shell and execute
this example and see how it is working
so as you can see uh shell has
been started now I don't want to get
into the details of all of it I will
cover in a separate tutorial where we'll
understand how to create a database and
how to create a collection in mongodb
separately guys stay tuned to the
channel for that so we'll just cover uh
how we'll Implement mongodb uh
projection with certain examples here
now the basically uh in order to
retrieve the databases that are present
in our mongodb we have to use
recommendous show DBS so it will list
out all the databases that are present
we have admin config local and simply
code one now I have already created uh
the simply code one and hindsight before
itself so that they can save a bit of
time and have already created a
collection in that so before you see the
collection and the documents that are
present in it you have to use uh the
simply code database so for that we'll
use the simply code one as our Command
so as you can see it is saying that
switch to DB simply code now if you want
to find all collection that are present
in database you have to uh basically
write as
social collections so it will list out
all the collections in that now as you
can see I have a collection that is of
employee here so for example I will
consider this same collection now I have
this below collection named as employee
with uh let's say certain number of
documents in that now if I query the
collection in the shell if I write
a command to it to return all the
documents or fields from the matching
documents by default it will basically
it will return all your documents so for
that I will use a statement like which
is of DB
dot mention the collection name that is
employee dot find so file method is used
to list out all the documents so you can
just see that we have a lot of documents
in our resultant Set uh let me just
scroll and go to the top so as you can
see we have different documents a number
of documents and it has different fields
like ID employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID and so
on so you can see we have a lot of
documents so let's just count how many
documents we have for that you can use
the count statement
so
DB dot employee dot count so you can see
we have a total of 50 documents present
in our employee collection now if you
look at our resultant set after we used
the find method you can see it has
returned all the fields of the document
from The Collection now but what if I
want to fetch only a particular field
like let's say first name last name
email or even their salary
how will we do that now the answer is
using mongodb projection we will Project
Specific fields to return from the query
now so before proceeding to mongodb
projection yes let's recall how we fit
certain fields from you know our
traditional SQL database so that we can
have a clear understanding now let's say
suppose The Collection employee is a
table in SQL and let's say all the
fields like employee ID first name last
name so on are its columns now I want to
fetch the only uh the let's say first
name last name
uh from the table so in that case what
we'll write will basically write a query
as select first name
last name
drama table that is employed right I
hope I am clear with this so it is
similar to that in mongodb wherein we
are executing this query as uh using
projection so let us now see how we do
projection here
so let's just uh consider as an example
here now let's say I'm writing a command
as DB dot employee dot find
and let's say if I want to fix all the
documents of all the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so in that case
what I'll do is Department
so it is says a case sensitive guy so
make sure you write in the capitals or
whatever the field is written as
so mention the column and within the
double quotes mention 30.
so close the uh parenthesis and close
the square brackets as well so it will
basically list out as you can see all
the documents of the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so we can see we
have employee ID of the employee 114 115
116 117 118 and 119 whose all their
department is 30.
now again even if I am returning a
particular field or a condition it is
also you know retrieving all the fields
from all the documents now I don't want
that now I want only a particular field
so what in that case we will project
certain Fields without returning all the
fields from our documents so let us see
how it works so the query is followed as
DB Dot
mention the collection name employee
find
open the square brackets
and let's say uh I want to retrieve only
the first name
first name so I'm setting it as one
as we discussed earlier if you want to
retrieve the particular field you have
to mention one and similarly I want to
mention I want to retrieve the last name
as well
last name
column and one and also let us take
another field let's say a salary
right we have salary also let us just
retrieve that as well as one
all right close the parenthesis and
close the square brackets and enter so
we do not have any output here guys that
is because we haven't mentioned the
parenthesis uh before the find method so
let me just copy stand we will see how
it is
so before after the find we'll have to
mention the uh parenthesis again
okay
and then I think we are good to go now
so as you can see in a resultant set now
since we have only mentioned the first
name last name and the salary it is only
displaying the results
only those only certain fields that is
the first name last name and salary in a
result and set now by default this ID
object is uh you know retrieved uh with
the command so if you want to eliminate
that as well you can keep the ID to zero
so let us just execute that so let me
just copy this again
paste it and mention another uh criteria
that is
the field now the field should be
a field that is of ID should be 0.
so close the parenthesis
so let us just execute this and we'll
see how it is the output so as you can
see now only we have the first name last
name and salary of all the employees so
we have just basically eliminated the
object idea as well so if you want uh
only uh the first name last name and
salary in your output you can just
mention the field names and mention one
if you want to display a result and set
and if you want to display if you do not
want to display those certain Fields you
can mention as zero so initially you can
use the projection query operator in
order to project only certain fields
from all the documents so yes I guess
that was all about the mongodb
projection guys uh now projection query
operator can be quite useful when you
are handling a lot of unstructured data
let's say if the database has like 10
000 or even a million records in such
case if you want to return a specific
number of fields on only now a document
can have any number of fields like 10 20
30 40 and so on so in some cases if you
want to retrieve or specify only certain
number of fields in your resultant set
in that case projection operator can be
quite useful and I know it is quite
confusing at the beginning so just me
you just need more practice to
understand this in a more better way
so
that brings us to the end of today's
session guys uh I hope you have
understood all the topics and Concepts
covered in today's session so sorting or
limiting are one of the necessary
database operations it helps to simplify
and the readability of the data and sort
the data as per the user requirement now
when you're working on huge chunks of
data in a database both sorting and
limit operations can be quite a handful
to understand and visualize data in
order to get meaningful information out
of it and retrieve only the specified
number of Records accordingly as per
your need so in this tutorial you will
learn all about the sorting and limiting
Concepts and how it can be implemented
in mongodb database but before we get
started if you are new to the channel
and haven't subscribed already consider
getting subscribe to our channel it's
simply code to stay updated with all the
latest tech content and hit that Bell
icon to never miss an update from us so
without any further Ado let's get
started
so before getting into the execution
part let us quickly understand what is
sorting in mongodb sorting is the
ordering of data in an increasing and
increasing order based on set of
relationships between the various data
items present in the database now
sorting can be done on any entities
having information like ID name is
address or any data type having numbers
or string values now sorting improves
the readability and consistency of the
data displayed from the database so in a
nutshell sorting is done just like in
any other database or programming
language that involves arranging data
into some meaningful information to make
it easier to understand analyze or
visualize let us understand its syntax
the syntax is simple it is followed as
DB dot collection name find dot sort and
within the parenthesis mention the field
and the order so let us understand how
it is now for sorting your mongodb
documents you need to make use so this
sort method so this method will accept a
document that has a list of fields and
the order for sorting so for indicating
the Sorting order you have to set the
value 1 or -1 with this specific entity
based on which the ordering will be set
and displayed so if the order is is one
it will basically
uh sort the records in ascending order
that is in an increasing manner and if
you mention the order is -1 it will
basically sort sort the uh data in the
descending order that is in a decreasing
manner so one indicates organizing data
in ascending order while minus one
indicates organizing in deciding order
so that was all about the Sorting in
mongodb so let us now understand how
sort method Works in mongodb with an
example now consider a collection name
orders now if I just run a command DB
dot orders DOT fine I'll get these
collection which has three documents so
it has uh details of three customers
like Rahul pranav and kirti right so let
us now run a query where I'm using a
sort method here which is followed as DB
dot orders dot file and within the
parenthesis I am basically uh projecting
the query ID so that we will not have it
in our resultant set so and also I'm
sorting the data based on the customer
here so I'm mentioning customer
as well so that means it will basically
order in
the ascending order so this will be the
output guys now the output is now first
you'll have the customer details of
kirti because the letter alphabet K
starts first in the alphabets uh from A
to Z next we have Prana which starts
with p and then we have Rahul which
starts with r so this is a simple
example on how sorting method Works in
mongodb now let's say if I want to sort
multiple fields in a collection so in
what way will I be able to do it now let
us consider an example here let's say I
have a pet info collection here and we
have various records or you can say
documents and we have uh like various
Fields like name of the pet type and its
weight now let's say if I want to sort
multiple Fields uh within this
collection so I would write a query as
DB dot The Collection name which is pet
info DOT fine dot sort and next I am
sorting this collection based on its
type its weight and finally the ID
so type I'm giving it as one which will
basically do in an ascending order which
is an increasing manner whereas I am
doing uh the Sorting on the weight field
as minus 1 which is in decreasing order
that is in descending order that is from
highest to lowest and then I'm also
sorting the field ID as uh ascending
order that is I'm giving it as one
so when I run this command in mongodb
Shell this will uh this will what we are
basically basically the output of the
collection right so let us just
understand how it is working
now first I am uh sorting the data based
on that type now the Sorting is then
based on the priority that is given that
is first you have given the uh sorting
input as type then weight and the ID so
it will run the Sorting based on this
sequence only
so if you look at the first uh record of
the document we have uh the cad data
that is the we have three uh records of
cads uh having the same uh type right so
we have Lily Millie and Oliver which is
of type cat so basically it will arrange
those in ascending order since we have C
which is the starting or the uh
alphabetical or order of the alphabets
uh which comes uh the C comes first then
we have dog next we have kangaroo now
since we have uh the same records or the
same uh record of cat that is repeating
then it will check weight now since we
have given weight as minus 1 that is
from descending order that is why we
have the record of Lily whose weight is
12 at the first place next the uh
details of Milli whose weight is eight
and finally we have Oliver whose weight
is seven
so this means that if there are multiple
pets of the same type those pets are
sorted by their weight in must a
descending order now if there are
multiple pets with both the same type as
well as weight then those pets are
sorted by the ID field which you have
given to sort them in ascending order
now if we hadn't included the ID field
in the Sorting process then those pets
of the same type and the uh sorting
process then those threads of the same
type and weight could appear in any
order guys so without having a sort
field on a unique field such as the ID
field it would be entirely possible that
the result would come back in different
order when we run the query each time so
I hope you understood how the Sorting
works when we want to sort multiple
Fields within a document
so let us now understand what is limit
in mongodb the limit method in mongodb
is used to limit the number of Records
this method takes only one number type
of argument which is basically the
number of documents that you want to
display in your resultant set similarly
which we used to do in SQL also wherein
if we have like thousands of Records you
use the limit clause in order to
restrict a certain number of records and
specify only certain records in a
resultant set now the syntax is followed
as db.collection name dot file limit and
value now in the value you can give as
per your choice let's say if I give the
value as Phi it will display the first
five records or the documents from that
collection and similarly you can also
uh use the projection where you can
display the fields as per your
requirement by giving the values and
also the limit value and simultaneously
you can also sort the data and the limit
uh and limit those uh collections or
Limitless documents in the collections
as well and the syntax is followed as
db.collection name DOT fine dot sort
field order you can give multiple field
names in the Sorting uh you know
parenthesis and mention the limit method
and you can give the values that is
number of records that you want to fetch
in a resultant table so let us now
understand again how limit Works in DB
now again let us consider uh the orders
collection here now let's say if I want
to limit these collections now if I want
to retrieve only the first two documents
from this then the query would be DB dot
orders dot find limit and within the
time this I'm mentioning as two so this
would is this would be the output
wherein you will get the details of
Rahul and pranav which are basically the
first two documents which are present in
our collection order all right now what
if you want to sort and as well as limit
the data now what I'm doing here is I'm
basically projecting the ID field so I'm
keeping it as 0 so that we do not have
this in a resultant set next I'm sorting
uh this collection orders based on the
customers so I am giving customer as one
which will basically uh
sort the documents of the customers in
an ascending manner that is from lowest
to highest and then I'm limiting these
documents for only two values so uh when
I run this query this would be the
output
so customer I'm basically sorting in
ascending order so first we'll have
kirti and similarly next we have product
in an alphabetical order which is
following the alphabetical condition
starting from A to Z and since I'm also
using the limit Clause here up to two
values it will only retrieve the first
two values so this is how limit Works in
mongodb guys I hope you've got a better
understanding on how limit works you
know consider in this simple examples so
let us now jump into mongodb shell with
a proper execution and see how it gets
executed
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started and let us consider the simply
core database again so let us write the
command as you simply code one which
will basically select the code one
database and
let us see what are the collections
present in it and we have the employee
collection so let us just retrieve the
data that is present in this so I'm
using the find method DP Dot and send
the collection name and mention if find
method so it will retrieve all the data
that is present in it so we have uh data
like employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID
so firstly let us discuss some example
choosing the Sorting technique guys uh I
think we already have employee IDs in
alphabet I mean in sorted order so let
us just take another field let us sort
the manager ID field here so
the following query would be DB dot
employee
dot find
mention is sort
and within the sort mention the field
name which is manager ID
so I'm giving the order as one which
will uh sort the order in ascending
order
so close the parenthesis and let us
execute this
so basically you can type it to retrieve
all the records that are present so let
us just understand how it is working let
me just scroll back
you have so many records guys so it's
better we use the project field uh so
that we can have a clear understanding
so next time we'll use that
so this is our query which you have
executed now now since I've sorted the
manager ID in ascending order which I
have given the order value as one as you
can see uh since we do not have any
manager ID for this employee Stephen
King next we have the manager IDs 100
and next similarly we have hundred
hundred hundred
100 and so on and next we have one not
one
and one not a so as you can clearly see
114 as well so you can clearly see that
our data has been sorted in ascending
order when we are using this sorting
technique so let us now understand how
we can do that with another
you know sequence that is let us keep it
as minus one so in that case what it
will be is DV dot employee find
so I'm going to project some of the
fields because uh I don't want all these
uh you know unnecessary fields in my
resultant set so I'll just uh opt them
out so I don't want ID field
so I'm keeping it as 0
and I want first name
my resultant set so I'm keeping first
name next I want last name as well
keeping it as one and next last name
uh
and let's say uh finally manager ID only
okay
manager
ID
has one close the parenthesis now
mention the sort keyword
open the parenthesis mention the
field that you want to sort
in the way that is manage your ID
[Music]
so it is important that you mention
manager ID in the projection field guys
so if you do not mention and if you are
sorting manager ID without explicitly
calling it so you will get an error it
won't display so it is important that
you mention the manager ID in the
projection field also
close the brackets I think we are good
to go let us just recheck our code
oh okay okay right so I think there is
an error in the manager ID guys so let
me just copy this you know
so you might have a technical error so
make sure you give the correct name of
the field name otherwise you'll get an
error so I think we are good to go now
so let us just execute this statement
and we'll see the output so as you can
clearly see that in a result and Set uh
we are only fetching the first name last
name and manager ID since we have
projected some of the fields uh in a
resultant set and I'm sorting the data
based on the uh based on the manager ID
field and since I've given it as one it
will uh sort the data in ascending order
that is from lowest to highest so if you
can see the first
manager ID is 100 so list of all the
employees whose manager ID is hundred
has been shown next we have one not one
one or three uh similarly if you type it
we'll have the rest of the records as
well so you can see next one not eight
one fourteen 120 and so on 120 to 123 to
not one two not five so in this way you
can sort my uh various documents in
order of how you want to display or show
them in your resultant set
all right I hope you understood this
till now uh let us now sort multiple
field guys so let me just copy this
query
now again like as we discussed earlier
in in our presentation sorting multiple
Fields is not a big task it is just
simply that you have to add the uh
multiple Fields here so manager ID as
well as let's take salary also
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sort salary in uh descending order so
I'm mentioning it as minus one and also
let us uh project the field here as well
so salary
has one all right so let us execute this
statement and we'll see the output
so as you can see in a resultant set
after sorting the data uh based on the
fields of manager ID and salary if you
look at the output now since we have
sorted our manager ID in ascending order
since you have specified one as the
order it will uh basically sort the
order in ascending order that is from
lowest to highest and salary we have
mentioned the order as minus one so it
will do the opposite of that that is it
will sort the data in descending order
that is from highest to lowest so if you
look at the resultant output here guys
now since we have no manager ID for this
which is uh taken as let's say the least
value or zero so it is displaying first
next we have the salary minus one so if
you look at to the manager IDs uh of the
next uh like let's say four now since we
have the manager ID hundred which is the
lowest value and we have four same or
four or more uh same values then it will
move on to the next priority that we
have given to sort our document that is
salary so first now we have 82 000 as
our salary that is from descending order
it will uh basically sort the data in uh
descending order that is from highest to
lowest so we have 80 to thousand next we
have 80 000 next we have seventy nine
thousand eight hundred next you have
6558
000 next we have 1700 1700 similarly and
so on
so in this way you can sort multiple
Fields using the sort method as well I
hope you've understood how the sort
method Works uh in mongodb guys uh using
the single field or using multiple field
sorting how you can basically arrange
the data based on your name
all right let us now uh discuss some
examples using the limit Clause again
limit Clause is very easy guys it is
used to restrict or specify only certain
number of Records in a resultant set and
the uh
syntax is followed as DB Dot mentioned
the employee name DB dot Empire dot find
dot let's say limit I want only five
records of the uh you know employee
collection so I'm mentioning as Phi as
my value and when you enter uh when you
press the enter you can see the
resultant output has only five five
documents one two three
four and five so this is a simple
example of how you can use limit now you
can also use the limit using the sort
method as well so let us just copy this
and we will see how it gets executed
so let me just paste it here
now I'm just adding the limit method
here I want only let's say the first
four
okay now what I'm doing is I'm first
basically projecting some of the fields
that is the required number of years
that I want to fetch in my resultant set
then I am basically sorting this
documents in the uh manner of manager ID
salary in order of ascending order from
manager ID since we are given one and in
the order of descending order for salary
since we have given at -1 and I am
limiting the resultant uh you know
output to only four records so when I
press enter you can see we have only the
first four records so we have no manager
ID again next week if we consider the
manager ID here 100 for Adam Fripp whose
manager ID is 100 and next two also we
have this same manager ID here guys so
now the next uh thing is it will go on
to this salary like we discussed earlier
the salary is uh sorted here in
descending order from highest to lowest
so we have 800 000 next we have 80 000
next we have 79 000 so similarly if you
can
uh let's say let's limit to another
example let's say if I'm limiting to 10
all right so in that case it will
basically fetch the first n record so as
you can see one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten so all of them are
basically uh the records of the
employees whose manager ID is 100 and it
is basically arranging all the details
of the employees for salary in ascending
in descending order that is in the order
of minus one which we have specified
so that brings us to the end of today's
session guys I hope you all have
understood all about the sort and the uh
limit method that we use in mongodb a
good indexing strategy is essential for
ensuring that your you know database
returns your results as quickly as
possible now just like any other
relational databases where we perform
indexing similarly indexing in mongodb
is also a way to organize information so
that the database engine can quickly
find the relevant results more on that
soon but before we get started let us
first discuss the agenda for today's
session
in today's tutorial we'll be going
through different concepts wherein we'll
cover what are indexes in mongodb and
then we'll understand why is indexing
used in mongodb and up next we'll
discuss how does indexing work and then
we'll understand how to create an index
and after that we'll be going through
different types of indexes used in
mongodb and finally we'll end this
session uh with syntax and execution in
mongodb Shell I hope I made myself clear
with the agenda part so let us just go
ahead and understand what are indexes in
mongodb
so what are indexes in mongodb now
mongodb index is a special data
structure on which the data is on which
the index is created to hold the date of
specific fields of document now in the
absence of uh you know fields in the
fields and indexing in mongodb there is
a need to scan every collection document
to select those uh that match the query
statement now this scan requires mongodb
to process a large volume of data and is
highly efficient so if there is no
indexing done on a collection of let's
say thousands of documents your query
will keep finding specific documents in
order however mongodb would limit and
make it clear the number of documents to
be searched within your collection if
your documents have indexes so with the
help of indexes when they are applied at
the collection level it can store the
value of a specific field or set of
fields ordered by the value of the field
so those were that is what indexes are
in mongodb
let us now understand why is indexing
used in mongodb now mongodbs indexes
make it unnecessary to perform a
collection scan now from that what I
mean is collections can basically
involve looking through every document
in a collection that matches to your
query that you have returned to find a
particular or document or a field that
you are trying to return so when you
provide an indexing on documents let's
say on a database that you have like a
thousands or 50 000 records you can just
simply put an index which will improve
the search efficiency as well now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or multiple Fields And even
though a mongodb database can hold a lot
of data you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly and effectively
access the data you require from it and
finally indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which automatically
brings search efficiency in various
executions of statements all right
moving ahead let us now understand how
to create an index now creating an index
in mongodb is done by using the create
index method
foreign go through the syntax uh so the
syntax is followed as db.collection name
dot create index is the keyword and make
sure the i in index is capital otherwise
it will throw an error within the
parenthesis mention the field name that
you want to create an index on and next
we have one or minus one so one of these
following syntax shows how to add an
index to our collection so let us assume
we have you know same uh like employee
collection which is an example which has
various Fields name like employee ID
name salary or so on but for this I'm
creating an index on employee name and
I'm specifying as one now the one
parameter indicates that when the index
is created with the employee name field
value they should be sorted in ascending
order now please you have to note that
it is different from the you know
hashtag ID which is the by default ID
which is uh you know created when you
are creating a document so the ID field
is used to uniquely identify each
document in the collection which is
created automatically in the collection
by mongodb and the document will now be
sorted as per the employee name and not
the ID field
so I hope you've understood how to
create an example you will get a clear
cut idea when we go into the execution
part in mongodb so make sure to watch
the video till the end guys
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of indexes used in
mongodb now there are mainly three types
of indexes in mongodb the first one is
single field index next we have the
compounds compound index and finally we
have the multi-key index let us discuss
about each of them in detail now now we
know that a field in a document in a
collection can be indexed individually
so as the name suggests single field
index is used to create an index or only
a single field in a document So Below is
an example and the syntax for single
fill index uh on an uh tape on a
collection named as orders so the syntax
is db.collection name dot create index
and within the parenthesis field name so
you can either index them in the order
of ascending or descending by mentioning
one or minus one so I have considered an
example here of orders a collection
where I've created a index on a field
called price and I'm mentioning as minus
one so it will basically index in
descending order that is from highest to
lowest
next we have the compound index now
compound index is formed when multiple
fields are combined into a one single
index so a compound index is General an
index that holds a reference to multiple
Fields within a collection so for
example I have taken another uh
collection I mean the same collection of
orders and I am creating an index where
I am creating index of multiple Field
Services which is for price and for
customer name so again the syntax is
same which is DB dot mentioned the
collection name dot create index which
is the keyword and within the
parenthesis you can give as much as many
as you know field names to your name to
your sorry to your collection
so I hope you have understood what is
copper index as well so and finally we
have what is a multi-key index now
mongodb supports a multi-key index for
each element inside the array for an
array field so these elements consist of
you know scalar Fields like string
values integer values or even nested
objects now the uh syntax is same you
just have to mention uh the collection
uh name and mention the create index
keyword and within the parenthesis
mention the field name which is of only
array type so multi-key index you know
automatically creates a multi-key index
on an array by knowing its structure so
therefore you need not additionally
Define a multi key index in such case so
no additional definition is required as
such so let us understand with an
example here now let's say I have a
document here
uh different documents like I have three
different documents in a collection of
orders which has various Fields such as
ID customer address payment mode email
order total and Order items now if you
look at this collection I have order
items which has an array values for
example we have for first ID for
customer Rahul we have four different
array values of order items like item
name notebook and item name paper item
name Journal item name postcard so if I
want to create a multi-key index I'll
just simply write a query as DB dot
orders dot create index and within the
parenthesis mention the collection uh
mention the field name that is which is
order items and on which you want to
perform multi-key indexing now I want to
perform uh indexing on price which is a
array value within a collection right so
that is what I'm taking is order items
dot price and the order in which it will
index is ascending so for that I am
giving the parameter as one so with that
we have covered all the three different
main types of uh indexing indexes that
we generally use in mongodb so let us
now switch into mongodb for execution
part and see how they actually perform
now we do not clearly see that how the
index signal is going but it will
definitely improve the search efficiency
if you are working on you know more than
you know let's say thousands and
thousands of Records
so let us now jump into uh
mongodb shell for execution part
all right so as you can see mongodb
shell has started and firstly let us see
uh what are the databases that are
present so for that I'll use the short
DBS and we'll again use the simply code
one or DBS that we have all previously
used so use simply code
one
it says switch to Simply code now if you
want to find all the collections that
are present in that you just have to
write show collections so we have one
collection which is employee so we'll
use that so in order to find the values
or the documents that are present in
this collection we'll just write the DB
command which is DB dot employee dot
find
so it will just display all the values
type it for all the values so as you can
see we have various different documents
in this so when this perform a simple
index now we'll just create a single
field index now which is basically a
normal field index that you create so
the query would be DB Dot
employee
create
mention the create index keyword and
within the parenthesis uh so let us just
create uh you know our index on salary
field here right so mention the salary
field
mention the hyphen and we will uh Index
this in ascending order so I am giving
the parameter here as one so let us
execute this statement so when you
execute the statement it says salary
underscore one which is basically means
your index that you have created which
is has been successfully executed
so now that you've created your index
and if you want to view uh what are the
indexes that you have created you need
to use the get indexes keyword so let's
just find again so I'll use this
statement DB dot employee which is a
collection name now you need to use the
get indexes make sure the I is capital
otherwise you will find an error get
indexes and when you enter uh the and
when you enter this and you will find
this a list of following uh indexes that
you have created now I have already now
as I said earlier in the tutorial the ID
field is automatically created uh
within the you know database which uh
you know automatically creates the index
for the uh underscore ID but additional
to that I've already created email index
on our you know employee table and just
now I have created the salary index also
so you can see the list of all these uh
you know indexes that you have created
now let's say if you want to
or not delete or drop any of the index
that you have created so in that case
you have to use the drop index so I'll
just uh you know write the statement
again which is DB dot employee dot uh
mention the keyword drop index
okay and within the parenthesis mention
the index that you want to drop so let's
say if I want to drop the email I find
it unnecessary now so I'll just write
the email uh you know key key which is a
field and I'll mentioned this one and
I'll just close the compare emphasis and
I'll close the brackets as well so as
you can see it says okay uh you know
this it says and indexes uh is three and
okay one that means if finally you know
drop the index so we'll just use again
this you know get index and see whether
it is successfully deleted or not
let's just copy paste here and let us
enter so now you can see that we have
only two fields which is the underscore
ID which is you know by default which is
the index that I've created by the
database itself and additionally we have
the salary index that we have created
earlier and successfully we have deleted
the email
index from our collection or the
database so I hope you've understood
till now so that is what uh you know
index is about you know you just create
index to improve the search efficiency
now behind the uh database the
performance optimization or the
efficiency can be achieved which cannot
be viewed outside so I hope you
understood how to create a single field
here well let us now move to compound
index and we'll see how to create it
also
so I uh as discussed earlier you can use
multiple fields in a mongodb document to
create a compound index so I'll just
create a compound index on another
Fields so I'll just
create index
and within the parenthesis okay let us
now create uh you know index for let's
say job ID
job ID I am giving it as minus 1 the
order mention the comma
and let us create an index for let's say
Department ID as well
giving this a parameter 1 it will
basically index in the ascending order
so close the parenthesis
so as you can see it is saying job ID 1
Department ID one that is me that means
you have successfully created the index
so let's just uh confirm whether they
have created or not
so let us copy paste again
so now as you can see we have another
two indexes that we have created which
says you know job ID and for Department
ID as well
so this is how you can create a compound
index in your mongodb database as well
so in the compound uh in the above
component is that well we have created
the mongodb will first sort by the job
ID in the descending order since we have
provided minus 1 as the parameter it
will basically sort all the documents in
the descending order then with each
department ID it will sort in ascending
order since you have provided the
parameter as one now the index would
create a similar data structure for the
Department ID also which basically sorts
the data in the ascending order so that
brings us to the final which is
multi-key index now I don't think we
have you know array of fields or the
array of data in our document documents
so that we can perform uh but for now I
think I hope you understood how to
implement multi-key multi key index as
well it just suppose supports indexing
of array of data so when you create an
index for a field containing an array
mongodb will create a separate index
entries for every element in the array
data
so I think we have already almost
covered all the topics that we have
discussed in our agenda and I hope you
guys have understood as well so that
brings us to the end of today's session
guys I hope you've understood what are
indexes and how they are used you know
to uh search the data in a efficient and
a more quick way so defining indexes are
important you know for faster and
efficient searching of documents in a
collection and these indexes can be
created by the uh using Create index
method so I'm just recapping what we
have covered and indexes can be created
on just one field by using the single
field index method or multiple Fields
using the compound index and you can
even create indexes on array of fields
using the multi-key index as well so
what is Advanced indexing now we all
know what indexing is mongodb Right
which is an essential component which
improves the performance of the data
retrieval speed in the database so
mongodb indexing is a special data
structure on which the index is created
to hold the data of specific fields of
documents and in the absence of indexing
in mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection document to select those that
match the query statement now in our
previous tutorial on indexing in mongodb
we have just covered the basic uh you
know indexing techniques like our single
field and comp and compound Fields right
so now what if the database is working
on array of fields within a collection
right uh so let's say if I have a
student's database and in that I am
working on sub documents that is
documents that have array of fields in
them so in such case the indexing
becomes quite difficult
so if there is no indexing done on a
collection of thousands of document your
query will keep finding specific
document in order be it a single field
uh multiple fields or even array of
fields so it becomes quite difficult you
know to retrieve the value so indexes
are applied at the collection level and
it can store the value of specific field
or a set of fields so before jumping
into why uh I mean how exactly Advanced
indexing works on you know array of
fails let us understand uh you know why
why we need Advanced indexing you know
in addition to the normal indexing that
we do in mongodb so for that let us jump
into my mongodb compass for explanation
foreign
so as you can see mongodb Compass has
started and in a database simply code
one we have two different collection
that is employee and new employees here
now if you if I click at the new
employees it basically opens uh the
document Fields now you can see we have
like almost around 33 000 documents and
we have one index which is basically
done on the ID field if you look at go
to the indexes page we have the ID field
which is already indexed now if you
consider these many documents right
these huge tons of amounts of documents
like we have 33k and if I try to find
a particular document let's say I want
to file uh a name you know based on the
name I am trying to field
uh I think we have different names here
right so let's just take Department here
right so we have Department field
so I'm just finding value like let's say
uh I'm trying to find all the documents
which has polis as the department name
so I'll just write polish and try to
search it so close the brackets and let
us try to find
so it will basically find all the
documents or within the collection that
has Department as police here now if I
go to the explanation of this right
let's just click on explanation now if I
uh look the query performance of this uh
document or the query that I've written
for uh you know to find the details of
all the uh you know employees or the
people working in a company and the
background I'm trying to find what all
uh the documents that I want here right
so if you look at here we have a total
of 32 000 928 documents and in that we
have documents returned are thirteen
thousand five ninety
now it indirectly impacts the
performance guys now if you see we have
33 000 documents it is searching each
and every document where the department
uh is police so and after searching each
and every record a record it is
basically retrieving all the documents
so we have around 13590 which is close
to around 14k and if you look at the
actual query time it is around 23
milliseconds so that is quite a huge uh
you know amount of time for a database
to process such information now let's
say if I have like Millions like 10
lakhs or 15 lakhs of documents in such
case the time taken is more so in such
case we'll basically create an index
here now we all know how to create a
single index on a multiple index so
let's just create an index and we'll see
how it actually affects the uh you know
bigquery performance so I'm just
creating an index on Department field
and I'm basically indexing in ascending
so I'm just basically one I'm keeping it
as one so as you can see uh we have
created successfully uh the index for
the Department uh field here so let us
now try to uh find uh the data that is
the Department of that is the employees
or the people working as a police
so and if I try to find this and if I go
to the EXP again explanation part
so you can see now we have a total of
Thirteen thousand five ninety documents
now instead of searching all the
documents that is 33 000 we can directly
reference refer only those documents
that are required to us so you can see
index key examined only 13 590 and you
can see actual query execution time has
reduced a bit more like 17 Ms I think
that is also quite huge but I don't
think uh that is you know uh that can
affect actually so you can see this is
how index works now let's say if I
create multiple index let's say if I'm
trying to find multiple uh you know
Fields so in that case let us see how it
actually impacts
all right so let us now understand how
it works for a compound feed so when you
are trying to uh index uh multiple
Fields let us see how the query
performance does so let us know uh find
uh you know the details of the employees
whose department is police and let's say
the job titles is Sergeant so in that
case I'll basically search for
Department field where the department is
Polish
and put a comma and I've dropped it that
I'm searching for is basically Sergeant
so mention SAR Gent
okay close the brackets and let us now
find the documents
so if you look at it will only display
all the uh details of employees who is
basically job title is Sergeant and
department is police so let us now
understand how it is executing so let us
explain uh click on the explain button
so you could you can see that uh the
documents it is examining is basically
the all the documents that is present in
the collection that is thirty two
thousand nine Twenty Eight now out of
that it is returning 12 to 196. so as
you can see it is a time taking process
it is going through each and every
document now thing is we only have only
around 1300 documents where the
department is polished and the job title
is Sergeant so instead of that what I'll
do is I'll basically index the uh both
Department as well as the job title as
well so let us just create another index
here firstly for Department
create index so let us create another
index for job title
and let us create an index again so as
you can see we have created the index
successfully so let us now try to find
the documents all right it will find
that it will fetch all the documents and
let us now uh
basically uh click on the explain and
see how it does so as you can see now
the documents that is that it examined
now is 1296 which you've seen earlier
that all the details of employees whose
department is Polish and the job title
is Sergeant so after creating an index
it is only searching only those
documents whose department is police and
Sergeant as you can see the actual query
execution time is also reduced
drastically from almost 4 30 to
milliseconds to almost 16 milliseconds
so it'll also vary like if you click
again it will change to six milliseconds
now that it is find the details so it
keeps on changing so index basically
provides the user to efficiently uh
navigate through that data which is
required by them instead of searching
the whole data so now you might be
wondering why we need Advanced uh
technique now let's say if I have a sub
array fields in this documents so in
that case I need to query
those documents quickly right now it
will take more time than single field or
a compound field now that is where we
use Advanced indexing to uh index sub uh
array fields or sub documents
so let us now understand how advanced
indexing works and why we have uh you
know went through all that scenario on
mongodb Compass where we have understood
how indexing works for a single field as
well as compounding field and the need
for advanced indexing now let's say I
have a document of students uh let's say
I have their student ID their name age
courses now for courses field I have an
other additional uh you know array array
section where I am mentioning the course
ID course name and course credits so in
that case we have an array field here
right so in such case we'll use Advanced
indexing now Advanced indexing is
basically just another process where we
are using another technique right so
let's say if I have 20 million such
records right 26 million documents
present in my collection it will take a
lot of time so this is where we need to
use indexing process again so let's say
if you are indexing an array field the
Syntax for that would be
db.collection.create index mention the
array field name that is and the order
so I am creating an index on courses
right uh which is an array field there
so the query would be db.students.create
index courses and mention the order that
is one now you can also further uh you
know index sub document Fields right now
instead of just uh indexing the array
field you can also index the subdocument
field so let's just understand the
syntax here that is
dp.collection.create index field name
dot subdocument field name and the order
now why we are doing this now suppose
that we want to search documents you
know based on the course ID course name
or even the core uh course credits now
since all these fields are part of the
courses subdocument field right which we
will create an index here on all the
fields of this sub document now in this
example I've created an index field on a
subdocument which is course ID similarly
you can also create for course name as
well as the course credit also so the
query is followed as DB dot students
create index courses dot course ID and
I'm mentioning the order as one so once
the index is created we can search for
any of the sub document Fields utilizing
this uh in a query now remember that the
query expression has to follow the order
of the index specified that is either 1
or -1 otherwise you will get an error so
in this way we can use uh a technique
which is Advanced indexing in order to
query the array Fields as well as sub
document Fields now in addition to that
we have some other Advanced indexing
techniques which is uh another three
types of indexing techniques in mongodb
which is first one is geospital index
now mongodb uses 2D index and 2D spear
to increase the efficiency of database
queries while dealing with a geospatial
coordinate data next we also have text
index which provides support to text
search queries on string content so
basically text indexes can include any
field whose value is a string or an
array of string elements and finally we
have hashed index now basically hashed
index keep tracks of the entries with
hatches of the values of the index field
which is almost always the underscore ID
field which is created by default in all
the collection now this kind of index is
primarily necessary when you are
sharding data to distribute it evenly
now if you want to learn more about
sharding we have a dedicated video on
that as well so make sure to check that
on our Channel
foreign
guys so in this way you can use uh
Advanced indexing uh to create an index
on you know multi-key compound uh you
know Fields as well so let's say if you
have a document with an array field you
can just create indexing for an array
field creating an index or an array in
turn creates separate index entries for
each of its Fields so it will basically
separate uh create an index to an array
field so it will help you to find the
documents with which are having any
array field values as well so I hope you
understood uh all the techniques and how
we Implement Advanced indexing in
mongodb when you first start working
with mongodb you will most likely use
the fine method or command for a variety
of queries now however as your queries
become more complex you will need to
learn more about aggregation in mongodb
which is used to perform various complex
operations so in this tutorial we'll be
covering the fundamentals of creating
aggregate queries in mongodb and how to
use various expressions in mongodb
aggregation and furthermore we'll
introduce the most important stages of
aggregation pipeline along with examples
of how to apply each one to this
pipeline stages but before we begin if
you're new to the channel and haven't
subscribed already consider getting
subscribe to our channel it's simply
code to stay updated with all the latest
tech content and hit that Bell icon to
never miss an update from us so without
any further Ado let's get started with
today's topic
all right firstly let us understand what
is aggregation and mongodb mongodb
process the data records in the database
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single computed result it
actually groups multiple documents
present in a collection applies an
aggregation operation to it and then
provides a user with a single result now
mongodb offers a wide range of
aggregation operations just like many
other database systems in relational
databases as well mongodb being a no SQL
database also provides with the same
functionality this enables you to filter
data as you might with a query as well
as grouping data sorting data into a
particular order or reorganizing
for returning the documents in the
collection now this is just similar to
the SQL wherein we use the group by
clause in our aggregation function with
the help of certain operations like
count average some minimum and value to
perform complex aggregation operations
in the similar way mongodb aggregation
is also similar to that of the SQL
aggregation method that we follow
so I hope you understood what is
aggregation in mongodb Let Us Now
understand why we use aggregation now
data from different sources is gathered
by an aggregation method which are then
processed to a single outcome now to
perform an aggregate function in a
relational database the database
management system typically extracts
data from multiple rows of the same
table but in a document oriented
database like mongodb the database will
gather information from various
documents in the same collection so it
basically group values from multiple
documents together to a single resultant
value now the next one is it fetches a
lot of nested data to perform complex
operations Now when using a database
management system you must run an
operation known as a query right each
time you want to retrieve data from
database however queries only return the
information that is already present in
the database you will frequently need to
carry out another type of operation
which is known as aggregation in order
to analyze your data in order to find
patterns or other information about the
data so if there are if there is a
complex operation that is needed for the
data that is present in documents you
need aggregation and finally it filters
and sort documents and analyze data
changes now uh mongodb being an SQL
nosql database the data model will
frequently change as the data that is
being you know inserting into the
database might change over the time so
in order to analyze this unstructured
data it becomes quite important that you
uh make a proper you know filtration and
sorting of these documents to get a
proper insights for your businesses and
as well as your you know requirements so
in that case aggregation can be quite
useful which simplifies you know the
complexity of the query that you have
written and fetches the data in no time
so these are some of the main reasons on
why we use aggregation
now aggregation uh in mongodb is
performed using uh aggregation pipeline
stages with consists of four different
you know methods the first one is match
next we have group Next we have sort and
finally we have project these four
combinedly are known as aggregation
pipeline stages which perform
aggregation as per the requirement now
firstly when you take a collection and
the first thing you need to is if you
want to match only certain Fields you
know within your documents to perform
aggregation then you can use the match
method next we have the group now just
like the group by clause in SQL you can
use the group uh you know function here
as well in order to group all these
similar or the related uh type of data
in your
you know pres present in your
collections that is the data that is
present in your documents to in order to
retrieve the similar kind of data you
can use the group Next sort again
sorting can be done in any other way
like from ascending order or descending
order next we have the project as we
discussed earlier in a previous tutorial
project is used to uh you know remove
the unnecessary fields that you want in
a result instead and finally after you
know matching all the four uh pipeline
stages then you get the resultant output
so let us understand this uh with an
example wherein will discuss how
aggregation Works in mongodb now as
discussed earlier the firstly the match
condition uh you know specifies only the
related documents that you want to
consider so for example I have a
collection name orders here and I'm
performing uh you know an aggregation
operation here so first I've mentioned
the match for status a so I have like
four documents here if you've seen the
orders like for the four different
customer IDs we have the amount and
status now I want to retrieve only uh
those documents whose status is a so for
that I'm using the match command here so
match command only retrieve the one that
you have specified here which is data
say so we have only three records that
have the status as field and their value
is a so we have sorted initially with
the match command next we want to group
the values in the order of their let's
say IDs and then so if you look at here
we have two similar IDs which is A123
and b212 so what group does is it will
match all the similar related uh Fields
together and produce a result so you can
see the A123 and B21 b212 are separated
into a different groups and finally what
I'm doing is I'm sorting I'm sorting and
I'm applying an operation here with sum
so what it does is it will basically
calculate the total amount here so if
you look at the first ID A123 the amount
is 500 and 250. so the resultant output
would be 750 and finally we have the
customer ID of p212 is amount is just
200. so in this way the aggregation
pipeline Works in a methodology of
wherein it matches the values that is
the similar values from the documents
then you can even group the data that
you want to show in a resultant output
and you can perform various operation uh
using the aggregate functions like some
minimum average with the help of sorting
as well so this is basically how
aggregation Works in mover DB so and
finally as discussed earlier just like
similar to SQL we have the same five or
the main five aggregation operations in
SQL which is the first one is sum it
basically adds up the values of every
documents of a collection next we have
the average which computes the average
value of every document of a collection
next we have minimum or Min Returns the
minimum of all values from the
collection and next we have Max which is
opposite to that of minimum minimum
which Returns the maximum of all values
from within the collection and finally
we have an additional uh you know
operation which is a push operation
since mongodb is non or relational
database we also work on the array of
elements so in order to add the values
to an array in the associated document
within a collection you can use the push
operation as well now this might be a
bit confusing for you guys now so let us
jump into mongodb shell for execution
part where it will will perform uh
different operations using the
aggregation pipeline stages and see how
they are getting implemented and also
perform a detailed analysis on the uh
data of the collection that we have and
we will bring out some inferences using
the aggregation operations using uh
various expressions like some average
minimum and maximum so without any
further delay let us jump into mongodb
shell so as you can see we have opened
the mongodb shell command prompt line so
let us just uh use the command show DBS
to find out the database present so we
have different databases like admin
config local and simply code one we'll
use the simply code one as usual so use
write the database name user B code one
now let us see the collections that are
present in the table so we have the
employee collection again so let us
write the command using the DB dot find
find
so it will retrieve all the values that
represent in this collection so we have
our different fields like employee ID
first name last name email phone number
hiring date job ID salary manager ID and
Department ID so all right let us now
perform the aggregate operations in a
sequential way firstly we look at the
match aggregation uh you know stage
where it will match the related fields
that we want in a result and set now
let's say if I want to match the
department ID whose all the employers
who belong to the department added let's
say 100 so in that case the following
query would be DB Dot
employee dot mention the aggregate
keyword here which is a must otherwise
it will throw an error when open the
parenthesis and mention the square
brackets and use the dollar symbol to
write the statement for match
put the call in
and open the parenthesis and mention the
department ID
field
which is uh on which we are basically
you know matching the records so
mentioned it again the colon and within
single quotes mentioned the department
ID name so since we have taken as 100
I'm just taking it close the uh flower
brackets
two times and again mention the square
bracket once again and close the
parenthesis all right so this is the uh
basically the query that we have written
here which is DB dot imported Aggregate
and we're using the match aggregation
method here wherein we are matching all
the records of the employees whose
Department ID belongs to 100 so let's
now enter
uh I think there is an error here
so we had a error in the syntax guys uh
so as you can see in the output we can
see only those records of the employees
were in it is showing are the records
whose Department ID is hundred so we
have the employee ID 108 109 110 111 and
112 113 and all of them have their
employee uh Department IDs sorry or
Department IDs 100
so I hope you understood this so let us
now uh go through the next stage of
aggregation Pipeline with whereinvale
group uh the values now so for that the
following query would be DB dot employee
dot aggregate
which is the keyword again open the
parenthesis
and mention the double
square brackets open the flower brackets
and use the dollar symbol again write
the group keyword
and open the flower brackets again
and mention the ID here so I'll explain
why we are taking this here again
so firstly let us just write the you
know command and then I'll explain to
you guys that why you are implementing
that so I want to group all the
basically the department IDs right so I
am taking Department ID
so make sure the dollar symbol
so the field name which is the
department ID
close the
flower brackets twice mentioned or a
double bracket square bracket as well
so when you enter uh you can see the
list of all the department IDs that are
present in our collection so we have
various I uh Department IDs like 60 10
30 70 40 110 115 20 98 and so on
so now you might have a doubt that why
we are using the idv layer now we are
using the group stage to group the input
documents by the specified you know ID
expression which returns a single
document containing the all the
cumulative values of all the ER
Department IDs that we have taken here
so in this above example only the group
stage is specified in the pipeline
whereas the group uses the ID field to
calculate at the value for all the input
documents as a whole so the expression
ID column uh
the dollar symbol Department ID creates
a distinct group on the field Department
name since we don't uh we didn't
calculate any accumulated values in our
document it Returns the distinct values
of Department IDs that are present in
the table or in a document so in this
way you can use the group aggregation
method as well
so this is how you can use the match and
group stages where you can combine both
these as well so next let us look at how
to create an aggregation operation using
one of the expression that we have like
count average sum or minimum now let's
say if I want to count the total
employees in a particular Department in
that case I'll basically use the match
statement wherein it will group all the
values of the employees whose Department
IDs in a particular you know value and
then it will count the total number of
employees in that group so for that the
following query would be DB Dot
employee Dot
aggregate
open the
open the brackets and uh
square brackets as well and then mention
the flower back brackets and then use
the dollar match uh group stage
wherein we are matching uh you know
the department ID let's say Department
ID of 60. so in that case it would be
Department
ID
I am taking the value as 60 mentioned in
the double quotes
and close the brackets
put a comma and then basically we are
counting right so I'll use the count
function here
so put the dollar sign
and check the account keyword
and let's say
the statement would be total
employees
in Department
60.
right so
mention the put these close the uh
brackets as well
square brackets
second
so when you press the enter in a
resultant output it states that total
employees and Department 60 is 5. so
similarly you can check for various
other departments as well so let us just
verify if it's showing correctly or not
I'll just copy paste this and let's say
for 100 now I want the total number of
employees present in the department 100
so in that case I'll just mention it
I'll just change the values and let us
now print the enter so as you can see in
the resultant set or there is in the
output you can see the total number of
employees and Department 100 is 6
wherein we have the total number of
employees and Department six days five
so in this way you can use the various
aggregation stages using the match group
and as well as sort as well and perform
various aggregation operations like Sim
uh some minimum maximum as well
so I think we have covered most of the
concepts that we have discussed in our
you know tutorial so that brings us to
the end of today's session guys I hope
you understood uh what aggregation
methods and how they are used in mongodb
all right as you know that mongodb
relationship represents how multiple
documents are logically connected to
each other in mongodb it provides two
types of relationships namely embedded
and referenced embedded documents
capture relationship between data by
storing related data in a single
document structure on the other hand
reference models store the relationship
between data by including links or
references from one document to another
now to implement a normalized database
structure in mongodb we use the concept
of reference relationship that is if you
look at the left side of the screen here
you can have an example where it is a
reference model where we have student
collection and inside we have ID and
then we have another uh you know
document contact details where we are
referencing using this student document
right so in that way we can use
reference model for that so we use this
concept of reference relationship also
referred to as manual or references in
which we manually store the reference
document ID inside another document now
what if the data that you're trying to
search isn't present in different
collection or in different database and
that's where you have to use dbrevs
dbrevs are references from one document
to another using the value of the first
document ID field collection name and
optionally its database DBS basically
allow you to uh more easily reference
documents stored in multiple collections
or database so if you look at this
example I have a user collection here
and a post collection here in the user
collection I have ID name post as my
fields and I'm trying to
fetch those from the post collection
which is another collection in in that
case right so if I'm trying to retrieve
data from another collection which may
be present in another database in such
case you have to reference the database
that you are trying to search for and
that is where we use dbref so and that
will bring us to the main part what is
you know mongodb database references
mongodb database references allow you to
more easily reference documents stored
in multiple collections or database so
relationship between documents can be
represented using this a DB reps which
offer a standard format and type so if a
database needs to communicate with a
variety of Frameworks and tools present
in mongodb Database The dbre Format
offers common links for representing the
data between the documents however in
cases where a document contains
references from different collections in
that case we have to use mongodb ddrefs
so it basically represents a document
rather than a specific reference type
and if you're trying to find data in
more than one collection in such case
you have to use mongodb database
references all right I hope you
understood what it is and let us now
move ahead and understand uh the various
parameters that we use you know while
writing you know database reference
syntax first we have the dollar ref
keyword now ref field basically holds
the name of the collection whereas where
the reference document resides next we
have the ID field the ID field basically
contains the value of the ID field in
the reference document and finally we
have the optional DB which contains the
name of the database where the document
or the reference document resides so in
mongodb these are the three important
fields which should be used in order to
implement dbrev's relationship as
follows
let us now understand the syntax of
mongodb database reference and how it is
exactly used now let's say if I have an
address collection here which I'm
basically creating two different fields
which is ID and City so the command is
the DB dot address dot insert and ID is
145 and city is Bengaluru next we have
another document which is DV dot address
dot insert which is the idea is 124 city
is Delhi so firstly we have inserted two
documents in our address collection now
let us move ahead and see
and how we can implement this using
another uh you know collection which is
which might be present in different
database now let's say if I have another
student collection and I mean that I'm
inserting records wherein I am inserting
records of uh student details like ID
I'm providing as one is first name of
the student is Rahul here so as you can
see here inside uh you know the address
ID which is the database reference field
which is part of the document or the
collection student collection present in
this collection we are using mongodb
reference approach to refer the address
ID present in another collection which
we have taken from the address
collection here after defining three
fields which are basically RAF ID and
optional DB so the RAF is basically by
providing the field which you want to
reference have a provider reference to
the collection that you are trying to
connect here so earlier we mentioned the
ID and the address in the address
collection right so I am referring to
that that's why I'm providing the
collection name as address and ID as 105
and database is optional you can keep
whatever you want I am just taking
simply it as simply code one and
similarly we are again inserting another
document and again we are referencing it
with the dbref dbref field which is
again address ID and for reference I'm
taking again address collection and IDs
124 and DP dot simply code
now you might have a question now what
exactly and how exactly mongodb dbref
works here now the syntax is followed as
VAR student DB dot student dot find one
which we use in order to uh find the
data now I'm trying to search the first
name with the name of Rohan so I want to
get the details or the address of this
student whose name is Rohan so for that
I'm querying as VAR student address
equals to student dot address ID and
after that mention the syntax as DB in
the Within These square brackets student
address dot dollar ref dot find ID where
student address dot ID now what does it
mean so I'm basically connecting both
the address collection and student
collection and that is what I'm
referring here student address dot
reference and student address dot ID so
in order to get the address of the
student Rohan you have to basically
provide a reference to both these uh
collections so that is what I'm doing
here so when you execute this statement
this will be the final output now for
Rohan we have uh the ID which is 145 and
his City the address is Bengaluru so
this is how exactly dbref Works in
mongodb and that brings us to the end of
today's session guys in this tutorial we
have revised the concepts of data
relationships in mongodb for the with
the likes of manual references used for
data modeling in the mongodb and
compared it against the concepts of
mongodb DB reps where the former is used
when the references are to be made to
the documents present in the same
collection so you can use manual
references when you are trying to make
references in the same documents or
which are present in the same collection
and the other uh you know part which is
mongodb dbrefs approaches used when the
references are to be made to the
documents present in different
Collections and in different database
now the main question comes is why is no
longer mongodb dbra's Concepts is not
used it is deprecated uh all around the
world and it is not a suggested method
when you are trying to work on this
mongodb database and that is the reason
also mongodb documentation recommends
manual references unless you have
documents referred to in multiple
locations or the collections in a
database so when you have multiple
collections for your references to
Target we would highly recommend it's
still easier to store the object ID and
collection name in the own object
without specifying or with a special
name of dbrevs and that won't break if
someone insert the field out of the
order now all the dbreps haven't been
deprecated in mongodb as such and the
functionality is unlikely to go away but
hopefully you can see there are good
reasons on why to use and how to avoid
this function that we have discussed in
this well coming to today's Topic in
today's session we look at how to use
covered queries and analyze those
covered query and the performance that
it creates while you query mongodb
database so which helps us to query data
more quickly so without any further Ado
let's get started but before we begin if
you're new to the channel and haven't
subscribed already consider getting
subscribed to our Channel simply code to
stay updated with all the latest tech
content and hit that Bell icon to never
miss an update from us
all right now what are covered queries
now we know that in every database
including mongodb indexes play crucial
role mongodb queries are executed more
quickly when indexes are used as you
know we have discussed in the previous
tutorials on mongodb indexing so if you
haven't checked that out make sure you
check that out on our Channel we have a
dedicated playlist on various mongodb
Concepts as well wherein we have covered
mongodb indexing as well so you make
sure you check that out now indexes
basically provide users with an
efficient way of querying data so if you
ran a query to find specific documents
let's say in a collection of thousands
or lacks of documents without any
indexes mongodb would have to search the
entire collection in order to find the
requested document in your query however
mongodb would use indexes if we had them
to reduce the number of documents that
needed to be searched in the collection
now there is an additional you know part
of indexing that is covered queries so
you've probably heard that column
indexing is an excellent way to improve
query performance by reducing the number
of disk access that are required now
covered queries is basically a mongodb
specific application of field indexing
in which all the query columns are
already indexed now it basically avoids
collection scan just like the normal
indexing so it allows the database to
search through less document to satisfy
a query without an index mongodb has to
scan through all the documents to ensure
it has answered the query correctly now
covered queries are extremely fast
because mongodb does not have to examine
any other documents other than the ones
that have been indexed so it only
examines document in your query that you
have provided the indexing uh that you
have provided the fields that are
already indexed
and finally fetching data becomes much
faster using you know covered queries
because uh covered queries return
results from an index directly without
having to access the source document and
are therefore very efficient as well
now there are case when you have to
consider when to use covered queries now
covered queries are only used when all
the fields in the query are part of the
index so let's say if you're trying to
find uh any field in your query it
should be a part of index that you have
already created only then covered
queries can come into picture or can be
used in a more efficient way
next is all the fields returned in the
query should be off are in the same
index now it can be a composite index it
can be a multi-key index but make sure
that the fields that you're returning in
a query should be in the same index and
finally no fields in the query are equal
to null that is field value should not
be null in in such case covered queries
will not be followed
now before getting into the execution
part let us just consider a simple
example on how query covered queries
Works in mongodb so let's say I have a
collection here which has three
different documents uh of various
customers like Rahul pranav and keerthi
and the orders that they have placed and
the various personal details like
address their payment mode email or the
total order items we have an array field
here wherein we are storing uh various
fields in order items like item name
like notebook paper general or postcard
and even their price and the quantity of
the items so we have three different
documents present in our collection here
now if I want to create a simple index
let's say I'm creating an index on
orders item field wherein I'm creating a
particular index on the price here so
and also payment mode I'm creating an
index so the query would be
db.orders.create index orders item dot
price I'm mentioning one that is in
ascending order the indexes is created
in ascending order and also for payment
mode I'm creating an index
now generally what you have to do is uh
what you do in general for indexing or
while querying your uh data that is
present in your collection is you just
mentioned the customer or let's say if
I'm trying to find the customer name
here that is Rahul if I consider this
example here it says DB dot orders dot
find customer Rahul orders item dot
price one payment code one now we are
providing the all the index field that
we have created that is audios item dot
price and payment code
but the query that I'm trying to find is
the data of customer here that is Rahul
which we have not indexed so let's say
I'm just having three uh documents here
now if there are let's say 10 000 10 000
documents that are present in collection
and maybe we have more than one Rahul in
such case it becomes difficult right
even the indexes uh is become an anomaly
here it is not as fast as what we have
thought here now instead of that I'm
just taking another query now let's say
I have created index on orders item dot
price and payment mode right now what
I'm doing is I am trying to return the
data or I'm querying for a data wherein
I'm trying to find the payment mode is
equals to card now if you look at
clearly into our you know index query
that we have created payment mode is
already included in the query Index
right we have already created earlier
and I'm trying to find it in the same
way so I'm trying to find payment Mode
card which is again already created
index which is payment mode so in that
case instead of looking through all the
uh data present in documents it will
simply locate only the ones which are
already indexed and that is the main
advantage of uh you know covered queries
it returns results from an index
directly without having to access any
Source document and it can be more
efficient uh more than just indexing
right so I hope you understood how you
know covered queries are actually
working in mongodb and let's just uh go
into mongodb shell now and get into the
execution part and understand it in a
more clear way and also finally we'll
analyze you know how this query is
working and how it is different from
indexing in mongodb
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started so the First Command would be is
basically the show DBS which will allow
us to show show all the database that
are presented on mongodb database so we
have the simply code one database so
we'll be using that only right or use
simply code
so it says switch to DP we are good to
go now let us see the collections that
are present in this database so we have
different collections like collection
name employee marks and new employees so
let us just consider uh all uh I mean a
collection that we have already created
here which is employee so let's just
find the idea
details for the documents that are
present in this collection so I'm using
the V Dot employee dot find command for
that
so when you enter it will display all
the records or the documents that are
present in this collection
all right now let us now create a
covered query now creating a covered
queries similar to that of how you
create an index uh so the query would be
DB dot employee
dot create
and mention the create index keyword
make sure the I is capital otherwise it
will throw an error so let's just create
a covered index on the fields let's say
we have manager ID and Department ID
right so we'll be creating uh you know
covered query that is on this two Fields
so
mention the field name that is manager
ID
keep it as one
comma and Department ID as well
as well close the brackets alert and
click enter so as you can see it says
manager ID uh the score one Department
underscore ID underscore one that means
you're successfully created you know
covered query on these two fields that
is manager ID and Department ID so now
let's query or read data from this
covered index so for that we'll again
use the find operation so let's say I'm
trying to find you know a particular
manager ID details right so let's say I
want to try find the details of
employees whose manager ID is 123 in
such case I'll use a query that is
DB Dot
employee Dot
find
and inside the brackets let's say
manager
ID
is 123 that I am going to search for
close the brackets and mention the
indexes that you have created here
which is again manage your ID
which is one
comma Department ID
which is again one here
close the brackets I think we are good
to go
so click on enter
so as you can see in the above query
when we find document where we are
trying to find manager ID which is 123
covered index which is on manager ID as
well as Department ID is already loaded
into the RAM and as we know that
so as we know that manager ID is already
present in a compound index that is why
it reads very quickly and we avoid
scanning of too many documents in
database so this is just a basic example
on how to create a covered query so
let's just create a you know another
field where we understand how covered
query exactly works now let's say I'm
trying to create an index on the first
name let's say first name as well
so let's take
the query as DB Dot
create index
I'm just copy pasting it here and let us
create you know another index for our
you know collection for this so it will
be first name here all right first
name
close the brackets
so as you can see our query has been
successfully created now let's say I'm
trying to find the employee details uh
using this uh you know index that you
have created now so I'll just
so let's say I'm trying to find an
employee whose first name is Shelly Now
by default since I've created index on
manager ID as well as Department ID it
will be directly indexed and display in
a resultant cell so make sure you keep
the first name field also because we
have uh created the index for that as
well
so mentioned first name
has one
comma all right I think we are good to
go now let's just uh see the result for
this
so there was a bit error in the first
time that we're trying to retrieve uh
now Shelley which we have taken uh her
name in all caps which is not exactly
present in the same way in our you know
collection so make sure uh you keep the
name as exactly which is present in our
database which is capital S and the rest
of them are small caps here so when I
try to uh find the you know result and
set for this the final output is the
first name which is hush name Shari and
we are getting the manager ID as well as
the department ID that she belongs to
which is manager ID is 101 and
Department ID is 110. now if you look at
this query covered index will not be
available when you use this following
query which is DB dot employee find
first name which is Shelley and we are
mentioning the indexes that we have
created for first name manager ID
Department ID because when we find a
document where first name is Shelley
which has covered index on uh basically
the first name manager ID and the
department ID which is already loaded
into the ram but by default uh you know
underscore ID is also present here that
is the field that is not present in the
covered index is also being displayed so
despite of
you know manager ID Department ID
present in our compound index we cannot
avoid scanning of too many documents in
our database so we need to exclude uh
you know underscore ID as well if you
are trying to use covered index so make
sure you include underscore ID in your
query as well
so the query now that would uh you know
followed as
with the help of uh you know indexes
that you have created make sure with the
first name keep the ID as 0 only then
top
who are mentioning underscore ID after
the department ID
keeping it as zero so let us just find
it now so as you can see we are only
retrieving first name Shelley manager ID
and Department ID and finally uh
underscore ID is being eliminated or
dismissed from this
so that was all about covered index guys
now you have to remember that covered
index does not work when field on which
we're trying to cover in covered indexes
and array or an embedded document that
is when you're trying to retrieve data
from a subdocument or a field that is
present in an array field in such case
covered index won't work so let us now
try to understand how to analyze this
query now the performance of indexing is
very crucial for a database performance
right so we need to understand how it is
being executed you know in the packet as
well so for that we'll use the explain
command here so for that the query is
same guys just copy paste the query that
you have uh you know created
and after that mention the explain
keyword or which is the explain command
here
so there was a bit issue or error in the
uh you know copying this code guys so
I'm just copying paste uh the query that
we have written here which is a DB dot
embroidery find first name Shelley first
name manager ID Department ID and all
the indexes that I've created on and
finally you have to mention the explain
command here now analyzing queries is
very important aspect of measuring how
well or the effective the database and
the indexing design is so for that I'm
using the explain you know command here
which basically provides information on
the query indexes that you have used you
know the performance that is the time
that it has taken to execute your query
and other statistics so it is very
helpful when analyzing how well your
indexes are optimized uh you know while
you are using an indexing or a covered
query so let's just uh see how it works
here click on enter
so you can see it is displaying all the
details of you know the performance or
the optimization of the query that has
taken place in the background here
foreign
so you can see we have various Fields
you know listed in all this here you can
see the namespace index filter set as
false and all that now we are only
concerned with here is this stage input
stage is IX scan that is index scan the
short form for this is index scan so
basically that we have performed a index
scan on the query that we have uh you
know created in a resultant set so it it
basically says another condition where
you'll find this is a collection scan
that is co LLS and scan so you may find
that that is you are not providing any
index instead of finding all the
documents one by one simultaneously
using a collection scan
that is another you know scenario in
which we consider you know the type of
scanning that you have done here and you
can also see that index name that we
have created that is first name and it's
multi-key it's it's false unique false
partial false and so on so it basically
indicates the number of you know
documents that have matched that are
returned here it indicates the total
number of documents that we have scanned
and indicate the total number of
documents or index entities that we have
scanned here all this you can find using
the explain operator here
well let's go ahead with the next area
that is called working with reactges
interview questions
now as we know it react.js is as
important as like in other tools which
you've already has seen so what is the
jsx here jsx called JavaScript syntax
extension
okay so this syntax extension to the
JavaScript in reactors is in the way
how you express to bind JS and HTML
together to result a j6
content so by using j6 you can write a
structure in the same file that contains
the JavaScript code that is something
more Innovative way because of that
react.js is creating a more buzz in a
market
so jsx actually helps making code more
easy to understand and debug and avoids
a lot of boilerplate code okay inside
the Dom structure
now the next thing is what is the
virtual Dom see the virtual Dom is
representing a Dom in a memory okay that
is called virtual Dom so manipulating
the real Dom is much more slower and
costly Affair okay because you need to
repaint the Dom over and over the period
of time when the user changes few things
so
when the state change virtual Dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real term okay
update instead of updating the entire
object so that makes your page to be
load far more faster
okay so in Virtual Dom what happens this
is the real Dom this is a virtual Dom so
the orange color portions which you're
seeing that is basically the changes
which has been made okay these are
called Changed object okay so virtual
Dom is basically compare it's to the
previous state and understand which area
it needs to send for the updates and
avoid the other areas
okay that's what this virtual Dom really
works
so what are react extension react
extensions are many like you talk about
like in flux it is a third party tool
which is responsible to attach
the State Management feature we talk
about react native which is responsible
to develop the hybrid mobile
applications
in JavaScript so these are two very
popular and there are many more which
are available
okay so like you talk about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering okay so Redux and
there are lot many other tools are also
available
so what is an event in react and how
you're going to create that so react is
basically offering the ideas of handing
the event very fairly easy so let me
talk about clicking anything you talk
about taking your mouse somewhere so
these kind of options generate an event
so for that we typically say alert and
you click on this render you click on
this button in a curly braces you call
the function to trigger to event
now what are the components in react
so friends react components are nothing
but a call View
okay like a complex view can be divided
into the smaller portions
a complex UI can be distributed further
to create more better and reusable views
clear so it splits the user interface
into the independent pieces of code
which can be developed and joins
later on okay so that's how you define
the component in and react so in angular
and react in both the areas the word
component is very much used so the
component meaning is very simple you
talk about a view
so what is the state in a react so state
is react is nothing but is the one which
identify what was and what is now okay
which stores the value for the specific
period of time which changes and react
is basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications okay so keep tracking
about all those States what it was there
like in I'm talking about an
incrementing an encounter so that is
also the state a variable there okay so
the state object is always initialized
in the Constructor so it can contain
some multiple properties so this dot set
state is used to change the value of the
state object and set state is
responsible
to
perform the shalomers between the new
state and the previous state
now the state holds the data that a
component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
accessed as you can see this example
here
in the Constructor we are defining the
super props and the states has been
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state rent
to the state and update the states
what is the higher order component and
pure component react higher components
are the component which are typically a
function okay that takes a component and
return a new component to you by
manipulating few things they're
basically designed for the reusing
okay so the higher the components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so to in order to perform some
reusability
a pure components are the components
okay is a variation of air component
that doesn't
that does a shallow comparison of props
and State
okay shallow comparison basically checks
what the equality
are we clear now so that's what the main
job
going ahead what do we Implement and how
do you implement react routing so to
implement a react routing react routing
also comes with inbuild
react modules and that particular module
to import it so
here we Define the react modules by
offering the route path where you have a
call left hand side is the name and the
right hand side is a component which you
would like to deliver it now
hello this is Matthew and we're going to
be going through some of the simple
questions that you would be asked during
a node.js interview what we're going to
do is we're actually going to break out
the section into three key areas
there'll be beginner questions there
will be an intermediate questions and
advanced questions and the expectation
is as you go through this video is that
these questions could be pushed together
as you're going through the interview
kind of think of it like this is if
you've answered the beginner questions
that you would get asked at the
beginning of the interview with
confidence and Surety then the client is
going to then jump to those intermediate
Advanced questions quite quickly and
they're looking for people who can help
them serve and solve their problems at
that more intermediate and advanced
level so let's just get started so the
first question you're probably going to
be asked is you know you know what is
node.js you know do you know what it's
for and essentially node.js is one of
the most popular if not the most popular
open source cross-platform JavaScript
programs and it allows you to build out
web applications that run on the server
it's extremely flexible it allows you
how to implement a lot of solutions
outside of just the the core programming
runtime and it allows you to build
Solutions extremely quickly in an open
source mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications we'll see
this later on and you may want to talk a
little bit about using express.js and
how you can build out apis uh to work
with node.js and connecting to databases
such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking at through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
blue
so you're going to be a van asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know your answer
and essentially the io refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
i o is the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked Yoko and you explain
the difference between front end and
back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
it's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets running the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of the web application gets run in the
front end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right on the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like Graphics is going to be on the
front end uh apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are using on
on the front end so HTML CSS JavaScript
those are all Common Core scripting
languages that you would use you can use
Frameworks such as angularjs and
react.js or view those would be a
front-end Frameworks back-end Frameworks
will include Java PHP Python and node.js
are some of the back-end Technologies
you could also throw in their dot net as
well I mean it's just a whole you know
listening of front-end and back-end
Technologies and Frameworks that you can
use and this is a actually a good point
to kind of explain the experience you
have outside of just working with
node.js but other technologies that
you've been working with that
potentially that the client is also
using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me um what it is you know
can you go into a little bit more um
details you know so you can provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to manage online
repositories of modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules
um in node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules like I come with
node.js now right out of the gate and
here are some of the modules that you
have and we also referenced that just
earlier on HTTP is a core module for uh
running a web server uh you have a
utility function that is useful for
developers to assess features within
your node.js project you have a URL
module for any URL passing you'd be
doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly gyro
it's a very mature stable language it's
been around for more than 20 years you
know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side in framework are the
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's a keyword there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
angular splits web applications into the
MVC and model view control components
whereas node.js generates a lot of
database I'm crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glued to your database
so let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
be asking what is
um the most popular database used with
node.js and there are a couple mongodb
is largely the most popular nosql
cross-platform database MySQL is also
very popular and that's a more
traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js Express JS is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's uh the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely faster
processing thing and event based model
uh it really is fast I can't is if you
have something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can
offload the task to another Solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro
JavaScript is used for building out your
applications with node.js great lots of
people know JavaScript
a restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks um if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier
how do you get around that barrier and
so for instance when you're talking uh
to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and but what I do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for
um getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivot to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
Pro for node.js designed for streaming
huge amounts of data in and out a con is
that node.js is single threaded and so
it can be CPU intensive but again there
are ways around that and a good way
around that is scaling Your solution and
elastic environment such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command and so an example we
have here is uh you can assign a
variable and the variable is going to be
for HTTP and you're going to then
require the HTTP service and that means
that the application itself won't run
unless the external Library the HTTP
library is installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event just think of it
as cause and effect it's just the basic
motion of physics so that's what a vent
driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event Loop in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event emitter has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects within
your event and we have an example of
this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and the executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there's two times uh one is
an asynchronous non-blocking function
and the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order
if I have the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute the response in a series for how
the response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with the URL module what it allows
you to do is really two things one is
that it provides the resolution passing
of a URLs for Utilities in your
application and then it allows you to
extend your module with built-in
Solutions and split up the web address
into a readable format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which will then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js
um I would express.js is a web
application framework that allows you to
build out Web Solutions for both mobile
and traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
being able to install and web.js is as
simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node packet manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
virus server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one stream for which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within node.js you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
listen that if you go to a web browser
that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to logo
host and an app that's running on Port
3000 and then depending on what we get
if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package and a
single file and then you can then share
that with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment
so what is a callback function in
node.js a callback function is
essentially that once you run and you've
triggered an event mongodb has
consistently been ranked as one of the
top five nosql database Management
Systems so if you're someone who's
applying for a position in database
management roles you will almost
certainly be working with mongodb at
some point now whether you are upgrading
your skills or interviewing for a
database management position using
mongodb it's a good idea to be familiar
with the most frequently Asked mongodb
interview questions and answers in the
latter case it is beneficial for you to
prepare for the interview so that you
are not God off guard even if you are
just interested in learning about
mongodb for the sake of upskilling keep
in mind that acquiring this kind of
knowledge may lead you to looking for a
better job which means you'll be facing

tutorial so firstly let us discuss the
agenda now this mongodb interview
question is intended to give you a
general idea of the types of interview
questions you might face now we'll be
covering some theoretical as well as
practical questions in this tutorial now
typically recruiters begin with simple
questions and gradually increase the
difficulty level so in this mongodb
interview questions tutorial we'll start
with the basics and the progress to more
complex questions now before we begin
with the types of questions that are
being asked here's a simple and quick
tip for everyone who is watching this
video now make sure you have the never
give up attitude I know it's that time
of the year where placements are going
in a rampant way but and I know you
might be giving interviews uh regularly
and what if you uh didn't get an offer
in one of the interviews from that so
make sure you have that attitude of
never give up and prepare for your next
interview and whenever you're giving an
interview make sure you are interactive
being interactive is one of the most
best or best way you can say in order to
get uh you know hired by the recruiter
so make sure you're conversing properly
with the interviewer while asking the
questions and finally behave
professionally which is another key
aspect while giving an interview so let
us now discuss the first question which
is the basic question which will be
asked which is explain what is mongodb
and its features so this is how you can
answer mongodb is basically an open
source cross platform nosql document
oriented database management system now
nosql pin can be utilized as a
substitute for traditional relational
databases like SQL and MySQL which is
dependent on the SQL language right so
if you want to work with large data sets
of distributed data where nosql
databases may be quite supportive which
are used to store large volumes of data
in the form of documents which will
offer the developers the flexibility to
work with the evolving data models as
there is no fixed schema in this now
relational databases such as MySQL and
Oracle store data in tables and rows
right they are based on a branch of a
theory known as relational databases now
these relational databases are
structured and tables can be linked with
each other via a foreign key which is a
property of relational database which is
asset property which is being Satisfied
by the relational database but whereas
the mongodb being a documented oriented
database it can handle only that sort of
information and store as well as
retrieve information from these
documents only it provides the
flexibility as well as scalability that
you want with the querying and indexing
according to your requirement this
mongodb basically is based on json-like
documents where we store all the
information in that so this is how you
can answer the question which is what is
mongodb and its features
well the next question is what are some
alternative nosql databases to mongodb
now we have various Alternatives from
mongodb such as Cassandra Apache
Cassandra is a free and open source
distributed nosql database management
system which is again similar to that of
mongodb to handle large amounts of
unstructured data across the servers
providing High availability with no
single point of failure Apache Cassandra
is a database which can be a right
choice when you need scalability and
also High availability without
compromising performance next we have
redis redis is actually another uh
popular nosql database which is an open
source which is implemented as a
distributed key value store with
optional durability it can be also used
as a catchy Adam message broker also we
have other types other popular nosql
databases like Amazon Dyno dynamodb
Apache headspace and neo4j now HP second
is an open source non-relational uh
distributed database guys it is
generally written in JavaScript and it
is also developed as part of the Apache
software foundation so these are some of
the examples and can be used in
alternative to mongodb
all right let us now move to the next
question which is what type of nosql
database is mongodb now in general we
have four different types of categories
when we talk about in which category
mongodb comes under so basically we have
key value column based document database
and graph database now when I talk about
key value these database store data as
an index key and value pairs this
database is stored data in a schema-less
way example of a key value data store
include Cassandra redis dynamodb and Etc
next we have column based now column
based or column store type of database
is the one where these databases are
designed to store data as Columns of
data rather than as rows as data if it
stores in a row type of data it becomes
a traditional which is not a noise
database right so again example of a
column store databases are hbase even
Cassandra comes under the column based
as well next we have the document data
base which is actually the type of nosql
database that we are looking for which
is mongodb now document databases had
designed to store documents with each
document having a unique key and popular
document databases are couch base and
mongodb and finally we also have a graph
type of database where they are based on
graph Theory so these databases have
basically designed for data which needs
to be represented as graphs so the data
that is present in this sort of database
is interconnected with multiple number
of relationship between them in in the
form of graphs and trees and a popular
graph database is neo4j as well as big
data so this is what mongodb is and it
comes under the document database type
of noise scale database the next
question is how does mongodb store data
now data in mongodb is stored in based
on documents or the Json style data
structures documents contain one or more
fields and each field contains a value
of a specific data type so mongodb
stores data records as documents which
are in the form of based on documents
which are gathered together in
collections so these documents as we
said earlier has a sub specific data
types including let's say arrays normal
General data and these documents tend to
share a similar structure which are
organized as collection so you can say a
group of documents are kept in a
collection it may be helpful to think of
documents as in a comparison to the rows
in a relational database so fields are
similar to columns and collections are
similar to tables in mySQL database
which is again a no it's a relational
database so this is how mongodb stores
data the next question is mongodb is a
schema less database if yes how do you
create schema in mongodb now the scheme
of a data base describes the structure
of the data to be stored right in a
relational database the schema defines
its tables its fields in each table and
the relationship between each field and
each table so if you take SQL as an
example which is a schema based database
right so in schema is defined by the
tables and the fields that is the
columns and rows that are present in it
and the relation between them
on the other hand we have mongodb now in
documented oriented databases like
mongodb data is stored in collections of
key value pairs now given that Json is a
schema free data structure and that
mongodb depends on it it would be more
accurate to say that it has a
dynamically typed data so whenever you
create an insert a document to create a
schema it will automatically create one
for you so whenever a document is added
the database will automatically create
the corresponding collection
the next question is how is mongodb
different from SQL and better than MySQL
now mongodb is again a documented
oriented nosql database which is used to
store high volume of data and which
needs to process your huge data in a
quick session now it is a database that
came into picture around the mid 2000s
and it is again considered into the
category of a nosql database whereas
when you take SQL SQL is a programming
language used to communicate with and
manipulate relational databases for
example MySQL now there are quite
differences between both of these
databases basis right being being one as
a relational database the other being
relational and non-relational database
there are quite differences between them
so for example if you take the structure
in SQL data is represented in tables
whereas the data is represented in
documents and this further documents are
stored in collections now schema again
SQL has a predefined schema so whenever
you are creating a table you need to
predefine its schema whereas mongodb
does not have the implications of
specifying any schema before working on
it so it has basically a dynamic schema
next we have this scalability the data
in SQL can be vertically scalable and
when it comes to mongodb both horizontal
and vertical scalable of scaling of data
is possible when I talk about
transactions SQL also supports Atomic
operations and follows asset properties
whereas Bongo DB does not have proper
support for transactions and it follows
cap theorem and finally the type of
operations now some operations that we
perform in relational databases like SQL
for example SQL supports join operation
whereas we don't have the same sort of
join operation and mongodb so in this
way mongodb is different from SQL and in
some ways it is better than MySQL in
terms of processing a lot of
unstructured data and also has certain
features like replication sharding and
mapreduce and some of more critical
features that are not present in MySQL
well the next question is what are the
different data models in mongodb now
data models are categorized into two
types the first one is embedded data
model the next one is referent data
model now if I talk about Emirate data
model embedded documents capture
relationship between data by storing
related data in a single document
structure whereas reference data models
store the relationship between data by
including any links or references from
one document to another
moving on to the next question the next
question is how does indexing Works in
mongodb now a good indexing strategy be
it a relational database or a nosql
database it is essential for ensuring
that your database returns your results
as quickly as possible now mongodb
indexing is a special data structure on
which the index is created to hold the
data of a specific fields in a document
now in the absence of indexing in
mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection which is basically a
collection scan so mongodb indexes make
it unnecessary to perform a collection
scan which involves looking through
every document in collection from
matches to your query it also provides
effective indexing strategy now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or more multiple Fields And
even through throughout a mongodb
database so you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly add let's say
effectively access the data you required
from it and it also provide search
efficiency now indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which will bring
search efficiency in various execution
of statements so this is how indexing
Works in mongodb
so moving on to the next question what
is mongodb replication and sharding now
if I talk about replication replication
means duplicating the same data across
multiple mongodb servers so the main use
of replication is the data is available
at an instant way that is high
availability of data and it also
supports data redundancy and multiple
copies of of the data are being saved
across servers and also it provides data
recovery and backup options as well so
in a nutshell you can say that database
replication is the process of copying
data from one database in one server to
another database in another server
ensuring that the same data is available
on more than one mongodb server so again
the main purpose of using replication is
data redundancy and high availability so
by keeping data several copies or
replica stored on physically separate
servers it will ensure that the data is
protected and it is also accessible
whenever we need and also by generating
multiple copies of your data replication
enables you to increase data
availability which is also another
important factor this is especially
helpful if a server fails so in that
case you can use the replication and
finally you can also recover the data
that is lost due to any uninterrupted or
any hardware failure issues
now if I talk about sharding sharding is
also similar to that of replication but
it is a method of Distributing data
across multiple databases and mongodb
supports this deployment of data with
having large data sets and high
throughput via sharding
so let's take an example so you can give
an example to the recruiter like this
let's say I have a database having two
million users and it has a capacity
which is 2 million records now what I'm
doing is I'm basically Distributing the
data across multiple databases and I'm
storing different data in different
databases now we have two machines which
has one million user capacity and
another 1 billion user capacity
so in this way you can add more and more
multiple databases in order to store
your data
so by adding more capacity to a single
server such as adding more memory and
processing units or adding more RAM on a
single server that can be done using
sharding
let us now to move on to the next
question which is explain horizontal and
vertical scaling now vertical scaling
refers to adding more resources like CPU
Ram or any hardware or hard drive disk
space to your server which is again a
database or an application server which
is done on demand on the other hand
horizontal scaling refers or involves
adding more processing units or physical
machines to your server or databases now
mongodb which is a nosql database
handles horizontal scaling through
sharding so in a nutshell you can say
that vertical scaling can be used in
order to increase or decrease the
capacity of existing Services whereas
horizontal scaling adds more resources
like virtual machines to your system to
spread out the workload across them the
next question is when should we embed
one document with another so you should
consider embedded document that is sub
document whenever you rely on these four
factors that is when the relationship is
one to few that is it can be one two one
too many but not one to one so for
unlimited use case you should start
considering separating sub documents
into another collection the next
situation is when retrieval is likely to
happen together which will improve the
performance in such case you can embed
one document with another the next
factor is when updates are likely to
happen at the same time you can use this
multi-document transaction by embedding
data model and finally when the field is
rarely updated in such case you can use
the embedded document
well let us now move on to the next
question which is what are replica sets
and explain primary and secondary
replica sets in mongodb the process of
replication as we discussed earlier is
done via using replica sets in simple
words it is a group of mongodb processes
to keep the same data across different
servers now a replica set is basically a
collection of related mongodb nodes
which must have three nodes at least now
one of them must be a primary and the
rest secondary ones and a replication
structure can have up to 50 nodes so the
main types of nodes that we have is
primary and the secondary or you can
call it them as primary and secondary
replica sets now when I talk about
primary replica set it is the primer is
the member in the replica set that
receives the write and read operations
but read operations can be pointed out
to secondary nodes changing the
configuration at the moment to perform
the query beside is the replica set can
have only one primary node at most and
talking about secondary the secondary is
the node where the data is replicated to
maintain a copy a replica set can have
one or more secondary nodes and the
clients cannot write data to secondary
ones only they can read from them and if
at all there is any failed node it works
as a secondary node again until it is
until a new primary node will be
replaced with that so this is what a
replica set means and the type of
replica set which is the primary and
secondary I hope you understood this
so moving on to the next question which
is what is the use of capped collections
now the size of collection in mongodb is
typically unrestricted right so the
collection increases its size as more
documents are being added to that now a
capped collection is a special type of
collection that has either a fixed
number of documents in a collection or
fixed number of elements so it creates
new documents by overriding the oldest
documents present in that collection so
collections can have maximum size or
document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond the maximum threshold
that is being allocated and all capped
collections must specify a maximum size
and may also specify a maximum document
count only now mongodb removes older
documents if a collection reaches the
maximum size limit before it reaches the
maximum document count so overall the
structure and functionality of a capped
collection supports high performance for
credit operations like create read and
delete so this is what cap collection
says and some of it characteristics and
why we use it
let us now move on to the next question
which is how can you store images videos
and other large files now we often need
to store files in our databases but
mongodb sometimes or it doesn't let you
store any file larger than 16 MB in a
normal document so what you have to do
instead Momo DB has a functionality
specifically for storing large files and
it goes by the name gridfs yes you have
heard it right grid FS is a driver
specification for uploading and
retrieval of mongodb files which are
larger than 16mp in order to store
images videos and other large files it
is one of the most popular
specifications and it it has a size
limit of more than 16 MB so you can
store images videos that have size more
than of 16 MB now chunks of files like
beaten audio it update of PDF file or
anything it is being streamed as a
chunks so these are streamed into the
database and each chunk is limited 255
KB in this size this means that the last
chunk is normally either equal to or
less than 255 KB so whenever you read
from grade FS the driver resembles all
the chunks as needed this means that you
can read sections of a file as per your
query range
so I hope you understood uh what is grid
fs and what is the process to store
images videos and other large files
which is of more than 16 MB so basically
the interviewer want to know that
whether you are not familiar with the
concept of grid FS so that is the reason
he might ask you this question so you
have to be well prepared for it
well the next question is explain
aggregation in mongodb mongodb
aggregation process the data records
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single competent result just
like any other operations that are
performed in a relational database
similar to that aggregation is also used
in order to act on a group of values
from multiple documents present in a
collection to perform operations for
this grouped values and return a single
competed results now it actually groups
multiple documents which applies an
aggregation operation and it is
basically returning as the particular
value that we want from that operation
now there are various ways on how you
can perform aggregation we have three
different ways of carrying the
aggregation process in mongodb the first
one is aggregation pipeline next we have
mapreduce and finally we have single
purpose aggregation so you can further
explain each of these aggregation uh
depending upon the interviewer's
preference so basically agree irrigation
process in mongodb is modeled on the
concepts of data processing pipeline so
multiple document enter the pipeline and
then these documents are being
transformed into the aggregated results
next we have the map reduce as the name
suggests it does to operation which is
mapping and then reducing that operation
so it will map each document and process
along with one or more objects for each
document and reduce phase in which
output of map operations are being
combined together and finally we have
single purpose aggregation operation
where these operations aggregate all the
documents from a single collection in
mongodb now even though they provide a
simple access to the basic aggregation
operations they lack the flexibility
that are being provided by the
aggregation Pipeline and map reduce
operation
so these are the three uh aggregation
pipeline method which they go through
first is basically the math stage which
will filter the records or the documents
we need to work with uh and next it
performs the group operation which
basically is the aggregation and finally
it will sort the data so it will sort
the resulting documents the way we
require that is an ascending and
descending order now just like uh any
other operations given by aggregation
and mongodb we also have five different
types of operations that we can perform
which is sum which will add up the
values of every document next we have
average which will complete the average
value of every document and we have Min
which returns a minimum value from a
document and we have Max which will
written the maximum value within a
collection and finally we have Push
which will add the value to an array in
the document moving on to the next
question what is meant by ID field in
mongodb ide is the field that uniquely
identifies a document present in the
mongod EB collection so when you are
trying to insert a new document into the
database mongodb will automatically
create a unique ID field which will have
a unique value to its name now by
default mongodb creates a unique index
for the ID field during the creation of
any collection and the ID field is
always the first field in the document
and if the server receives a document
that does not have any ID field first
then the server will move the field at
the beginning and also ID field can be
avoided in the document that you want to
return by setting the value of the ID
field as 0 in the query
so what are some utilities for backup
and restoring in mongodb now by default
mongodb shell does not include any
import export of data or even
duplication or retrieval of uh data from
other uh you know applications but
however mongodb provides the utilities
and database tools to take backup and
perform the restore operations now
mainly we have four type of backup and
restoring options which are input
 export term and malware
restore so you can use one of these
utilities like Dom import export
and restore to move your data in and out
of your mongodb database now the most
commonly used are mongodum and
restore the mongodon utility creates a
binary backup you know of a mongodb
database the mongodom tool is the
preferred method of dumping data from
your Source mongodb deployment and if
you're trying uh to restore the data
that you have basically deleted or
dumped you can use the Monger register
in order to fetch back the data that you
have dumped
so the next question is can you explain
about mapreduce process in mongodb
mapreduce is basically a data processing
Paradigm for condensing large volumes of
data into useful aggregated results so
basically mongodb provides the map
reduce features for only aggregation
purposes and generally there are two
phases of the map reduce as you can see
in the name which is mapping and
reducing so in the first phase each
document is processed and emits common
and redundant part of the document to
pass a unique record for the next phase
and in the next phase all the unique
part gets together and aggregated to
produce a single result and finally we
have a query here we'll pass the query
to filter the resultant set so with the
help of map reduce user can perform
sorting filtering and document
modification as per their need
so moving on to the next question which
is how does mongodb Ensure High
availability of data
in general High availability refers to
the uh you know Improvement of a system
or any applications availability by
minimizing the downtime caused by
routine maintenance or any hardware
related uh you know issues so mongodb
automatically stores copy sets and
multiple copies of data distributed
across servers and data centers now in
general mongodb is one such database
which can provide High availability for
the users by using features like
replication and sharding now in
replication the replica sets help
prevent website downtime using native
duplication and automatic failures now
mongodb has a great support for high
availability without no thought through
replication set but replica set is not
enough for a production ready system
that is it requires a bit of planning in
order to deploy this so sometimes it
might be an issue but in most of the
cases if the system crashes or the
hardware or software faces any issues uh
you know ODB in the data mongodb helps
you recover and backup your data in the
system
so the next question is what is the role
of profiler in mongodb now so far we
have discussed some of the basic to
moderate uh level questions guys now
from here on you will find some
practical as well as you know advanced
level questions so you might need to
focus a little bit and even if you're
not confident and if you don't know the
answer which we are discussing now you
can directly tell to the recruiter of
the interviewer that you do not know the
answer but you hope that you have an
idea on this and you can work on that
and you can get back to him so again
let's get back to the question which is
what is the role of profiler in mongodb
now database profiler is used to collect
information regarding the queries which
are executed on an individual database
instance so basically this uh profiler
in mongodb database allows you to
collect performance data about
operations occurring on a mongodb
instance
the next question is can we use regular
expressions in mongodb now in SQL we do
have regular Expressions where we need
uh where we write a query to find
certain patterns that are present in our
database table right in a similar way
regular expressions are also used to
match patterns in a document just like
finding a pattern in an SQL tables so
regular expression basically provides
patterns a sequence of characters for
matching and defining a search pattern
and also retrieving an unidentified
field using a certain pattern becomes
easily within a document and querying a
database in order to find a smaller
subset of data within a collection we
can use regular expression so regex
operator in mongodb provides regular
expression capabilities from pattern
matching strings in the queries and the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name dot find mention the field name and
mention the reex keyword and mention the
pattern now the pattern can be of any uh
of your choice
so the next question is how do you
search for documents in which a specific
field has one or more values now you can
say this is a bit of practical question
guys the interviewer wants to know
whether you are not uh whether or not
you are comfortable and have an idea of
using various operators in mongodb so
you can use the DB dot collection file
operation and also use a query operator
which is dollar in in order to specify
the field and the values that you want
to retrieve or you want to search for
inert document so for example I have
given an example which says that in
order to return all employees whose
title is product manager or executive
director in such case the query would be
DB dot employees dot find mention the
field which is title mention the uh in
which is a query operator here mention
the product manager and executive
director which we are trying to find so
if there is any record or the person who
is associated associated with this title
of product manager or executive director
it will retrieve the record now we have
a person name whose first name is Rahul
and last name is Kumar whose ages 29 and
title is product manager so this is how
you can search for a document with a
specific field which has one or more
values
so the next question is which command
are used to insert single and multiple
documents into a collection now we
basically have two types of commands
which is DB dot collection dot insert1
which will insert a single document into
a mongodb collection and it returns a
document containing the inserted
documents ID field and next we have the
same uh command but the keyword changes
which is insert mini which is insert a
single or even multiple records uh into
a mongodb collection again it returns a
document containing each inserted
document's ID
well the next question is what is the
difference between all and in operator
in mongodb now both all and in operator
are used to filter documents in a sub
array based on a conditional statement
so but there are
some differences or subtle differences
between all and in operator now when I
talk about all operator all operator
retrieves all the documents which
contains a subset of the value we pass
and this subset might be in any order
but whereas in operator retrieves all
the documents which contains the either
of the values we pass
moving on what is the next question is
both rights and rates become faster when
you add more slaves to replica set as
the statement true or false explain the
reason well this statement is false now
a replica set can only have a primary uh
at any particular time that is having a
one master with other nodes the
secondary notes being slaves so all
right operations are performed only on
the master node read operations on the
other hand can be performed on any
instance which can be a slave or a
master node so as a result adding more
slaves to a replica set accelerates only
reads operation and nods the and not the
rights operation so the statement is not
valid and it is a false statement we
cannot uh you know write and read both
uh operation when you add more slave to
replica set
the next question is what is Shard e and
mention the components of mongodb
sharded cluster now what is a short key
chart key is used by mongodb to
distribute the documents of a collection
across charts now on charting a mongodb
data set a short key is automatically
created by default so the short key can
be in the form of indexed field or
indexed compound fields that will be
used to distribute the data among the
shots generally The Shard key is used to
distribute the mongodb's collections
documents across all the shards where
the key consists of a single field or
multiple fields in every document now
the idea is to have multiple replica set
with multiple primaries which would
basically divide data and load it among
themselves and each of these replica set
is called as shut
chat basically has three components
which is basically Shard Mongoose and
config serger all this together
comprises of a mongodb sharded cluster
now when I talk about Shard what is a
Shard Shard contains a subset of the
sharded data okay A Shard is basically a
single mongodb server or a replica set
that stores a partition of the
application data that you have divided
now next we have the mongos Mongoose
router or the it is a router of
operations now because each chart
contains only part of the cluster data
you need something to root operations to
the appropriate charts that's where
mongos comes in the Mongoose process is
a router that directs all the reads
writes and commands to the appropriate
shard in this way mongos provides client
with a single point of contact with the
cluster and finally we have config
servers now Mongo's process are
basically are durable should be durable
that means it must be in a position to
store the metadata in order to properly
manage the cluster right which we have
formed with The Shard key so that's the
job of the config server this metadata
includes the cluster configuration the
location of each database collection and
the particular range of data there so
this is what basically short key is and
multiple components that are included in
the mongodb sharded cluster
so moving on to the next question which
is the joint plus is a key feature of
relational database systems what is the
mongodb equivalent if any and are there
any limitations now whenever we hear
about joints we have like different
operations like inner join after join
left join and uh you know cross join so
similarly we have a question here that
means if we talk about no SQL that means
we do not have no joints that means we
do have joints or we do not have joints
that's the main question
but the thing is we have a joint
equivalent in mongodb also which is the
lookup operator which is a significant
disadvantages that is it does not work
in charted collection right so it's
worth noting that rather than looking
for a direct equivalent to join mongodb
developers often simply denormalize the
data and which eliminates the need for a
join you know operation in a mongodb
database so in a nutshell you can say it
performs an outer join to a collection
in the same database to filter the
documents from The Joint collection for
processing now the lookup operator adds
a new array field to each input document
and this new array field contains the
matching documents from The Joint
collection
so the next question is mention some
pros and cons of normalizing data in
mongodb database now normalizing data is
a key factor in relation database but
what about mongodb now updated documents
is fast for normalized data and it is
relatively so slower for denormalized
data well on the other hand reading
documents is fast in denormalized data
and slower for normalized data so
denormalized data is hard to keep in
sync and takes up more space so rdbms
generally have this organic support for
normalization and a lot of data to be
managed as a separate entity whereas
nosql dbmss like mongodb do not have
this active support for normalization
so the next question is what are the
advantages of using mongodb now there
are various advantages of using mongodb
for example it is an open source DB that
is it is ready readily available for
everyone to download and perform the
operations right away and it is also
easy to use the syntax is also user
friendly just like SQL it is also highly
flexible which allows you to store and
work on different data types and allows
you to store unstructured data of
different types in one or more documents
and the security is also a Paramount
Feature for any user right so mongodb
provides Advanced security features as
well and we also talked about high
availability in our previous question
and it also has reliable indexing for a
faster retrieval of data it has a
flexible schema design unlike the
predefined schema in relational
databases so this flexible or the
dynamic schema design allows you to meet
the ever-changing conditions of the Big
Data applications uh you know with the
vast amount of data that is being
incorporated into the documents you can
have a better Edge on the data if you're
working on large scale applications then
mobile DB can be a great choice for you
with all this it also gives you high
performance which is another key feature
of mongodb and one of its greatest
advantage of a noiseql database
and that gives us the last question of
our interview question uh which is what
are some applications of mongodb now
mongodb being a noise called database is
widely popular in many uh sectors
nowadays and some of the major
applications or real-time use case of
mongodb is it is used in in iot which is
internet of things with the world
rapidly advancing in uh you know in
technology iot plays a crucial role and
it is important that we uh as a user you
know have these uh intention to store
the data and have that data predicted in
any sense now the data is only getting
larger and larger and we also heard this
phrase that data is the new oil so with
the coming in the coming years the data
is exceptionally going to rise and we
need mongodbs to store this uh huge or
huge volumes of data into our uh
databases right so it is one of the
applications of mongodb and we also have
mobile applications and in order to
perform real-time analysis and we also
have uh it is also used in catalog
management content management and for
product management and various others
sectors as well now companies also like
to use nosql databases uh because of its
flexible uh design and the need of you
know storing data without any uh
predefined schema makes it uh best nosql
database like companies like eBay
Shutterfly New York Times Verizon and
many other big companies use uh mongodb
nowadays and also the one of the real
life application of use cases the best
example you can give is aadhar card
which is India's unique identification
which is uh based on uh identifying a
person's you know identity so the other
uses mongodb to store this massive
amounts of demographic and biographic
biometric data of over more than 1.5
billion uh you Indian users so other
users mongodb in order to store the
images QR code details you know the
personal details of the user in its
database so these are some of the
applications of mongodb so this brings
us to the end of this full course on
month stack for 2023. we hope you had a
lot to learn and if you have any
