now let's start this session and
understand who is a product manager
a product manager is the one who defines
what success looks like for a product

in terms of a product and rallies the
team to make that Vision a reality they

defined the position of a product
manager or PM is crucial and critical in
many businesses all product managers
lead the development of products and are
ultimately in charge of the success of
those products even if the duties of PMS
vary quite a bit among Industries and
Enterprises

coordinating the efforts of all groups
working on a product including the
engineering design marketing and sales
teams production must be regularly
tracked and managed to ensure that it

now let's understand who is a product
owner
a product owner is a specialist who
makes certain a development team
completes duties that enhance a product
additionally they act in the clients and
their consumers best interest the
position is derived from scrum project
management a framework for setting up
the Team Dynamics and duties for a
project
the backlog or list of necessary work is

it requires these experts consequently
frequently possess extraordinary
strategic and communication abilities a
product owner acts as the organization's

the design team to identify the product
specs is the product owner this product
roadmap will consist of a prioritized
list of client requirements it is the
responsibility and accountability of

both roles focus on so let's begin with
knowing what a product manager focuses
on
the following categories can be used to
organize some of the product managers
tasks

now let's move this session toward the
responsibilities of both roles
now let's see what are the
responsibilities of a product manager to
maintain develop and increase the sales
of current products a product manager
must communicate with several internal
and external business stakeholders they
also must do research and come up with
ideas for new products based on their
interactions and experiences
a product manager must do market
research undertake margin analysis and
evaluate performance to analyze product
demand positioning and profitability as
well as forecast future trends product
managers also make pricing branding and
other decisions the very first
responsibility of a product manager is
monitoring competitors finding and
analyzing your competitors products
prices and sales and marketing
strategies is known as competitive
monitoring sometimes known as
competitive analysis the next
responsibility of the product manager is
understanding the user's needs
it is your duty as a product manager to
determine the target market and to
understand the people who use your
service or your users and what they want
to do to build a solution that works for
them
the next responsibility is assembling
market research and competition data
by conducting market research you might
meet clients for your company
investigating your competitors may
enable you to set your business apart
for a Competitive Edge for your small
business figure out how to combine them
to learn more about the market product
managers speak with data scientists
the next responsibility is monitoring
internal stakeholders
monitoring stakeholders is the process
of looking closely at stakeholder
relationships for products tailoring
engagement tactics for stakeholders
through changes to engagement strategies
and plans and observing and managing the
team translation transferring
information from the design team to the
development team
the next responsibility of a product
manager is to achieve the product goals
and objectives product goals translate
the product Vision into specific
measurable objectives they are quite
detailed in terms of your product's
performance after it is completed and
how you'll measure it the last
responsibility of the product manager is
depicting the parameters for product
accomplishment by providing the metrics
and data one may obtain a sense of how
to position the product successfully in
the market
now let's move toward the
responsibilities of a product owner both
product owners and managers are involved
in the process of developing new
products but their responsibilities are
distinct in terms of how they accomplish
objectives and where they are located at
various stages of the process
the very first responsibility of product
owners is engaging stakeholders
product owners often collaborate with
internal stakeholders inside the
business they oversee important
interactions with managers their
departments and the board of directors
to develop the goods and provide answers
these experts gather data from various
parties to enhance user stories in the
backlog a product owner may speak with
end users directly When developing a
product taking into account the
viewpoints of many professionals and
customers may help both roles perform
their responsibilities more successfully
moving on to the next responsibility of
a product owner is taking care of
obligations
product owners concentrate more narrowly
on small-scale activities product owners
are in charge of a Project's day-to-day
operations and details while product
managers focus on the project as a whole
to assure product fulfillment these
experts May for example oversee the
manufacturing team create a backlog and
work with warehouses
the next responsibility of a product
owner is analyzing customers
similar research is conducted by product
owners to understand the needs and
preferences of the target market but
they are also in charge of teaching the
whole team about these topics product
owners in scrum teams see to it that all
team members incorporate consumer
perspectives while creating or updating
these features along with the product
manager they also help the backlog be
optimized based on client input and
check to see if a product adequately
incorporates it moving forward the next
responsibility of a product owner is
directing group efforts
product owners often collaborate with
teams daily to make sure they correctly
follow a plan and meet backlog
requirements as a consequence they could
collaborate with product managers to
choose the most important features and
the most suitable schedule
additionally these experts could let
designers know what is expected of them
and assist them in creating mock-ups or
prototypes
the next responsibility of a product
owner is product backlog management
the product owner must compile the
backlog of items and prioritize them
following the overarching strategy and
corporate goals the product owner will
also need to map out project
dependencies to determine the proper
order of development
but the product backlog isn't just a
list of things to accomplish it's a
dynamic document that has to be updated
often in response to changing project
requirements as it develops
and the last responsibility of a product
owner is observing the stages of
development the product owner should
devote a substantial amount of time to
managing the actual creation of the
product once the vision strategy and
product priorities have been established
they play a significant role in All
Phases of the event including planning
fine-tuning reviewing and sprinting the
agile product owner collaborates with
stakeholders throughout the planning
phases to determine and arrange the
tasks necessary for the following
iteration after that they will get
together with their team to polish the
procedure pinpoint any problems and
assist with the Sprint
now let's move on to the skills of both
product managers and product owners so
let's begin with skills required by a
product manager strategic thinking
understanding your position in the
market concentrating on the goals and
seeing chances can help you plan and
build tactics
leadership skills the capacity of a
person to inspire and guide a team of
others working together to accomplish a
common objective
and time management the capacity to
effectively manage time so that the
product may be delivered in the allotted
time empathy skills the capacity to
relate to and comprehend the ideas and
feelings of another person empathy
requires placing oneself and the other
person's position
communication skills how one interacts
with others and the act of imparting
knowledge our ability to communicate
effectively allows us to provide
information in a way that the audience
can comprehend it presentation skills
the capacity to convey in an engaging
original and Visually appealing manner
now let's move ahead and know the skills
required by product owners design
reasoning to promote product
breakthroughs product owners must feel
at ease creating hypothesis-driven
development environments
analytical skills the management
evaluation and approval of the product
backlog should be the top priority for a
product owner
for this reason they need to be Adept
analysts who can review product problems
and upgrades critically and come up with
logical remedies rapidly
cooperation abilities
product owners who act as Liaisons
between scrum teams must be at ease with
continual engagement they should
prioritize cooperation and be at ease
with delegating dispute resolution and
interacting with people of all
temperaments and emotions
decision making another essential
ability for product owners is decision
making the product owner a senior member
of a product development team makes
several choices every day including
choosing which items to add to the
product backlog how to rank them and how
to inform the team of these decisions
resolution of disputes
the resolution of disputes is the
capacity to resolve problems using
established techniques or developing new
ones because of the many parties engaged
in the project disputes may arise often
for you as the product owner during the
product development cycle
aptitude for learning one of the most
crucial qualities for product owners to
have is an aptitude for learning it's
crucial to be abreast of the most recent
market trends customer demands and
corporate requirements
moving on with our session let's
understand the difference between
product managers and product owners
product managers have a greater
strategic role with broader corporate
objectives in mind they Define and map
out the product management process
across the product life cycle
whereas product owners take on a more
proactive role and prioritize immediate
fulfillment
by creating customer Stories the team
can utilize to make more user-led
decisions for product development May
assist in maximizing the value of the
product
they concentrate on the market corporate
goals and the product's vision
whereas product owners collaborate with
cross-functional agile teams to carry
out these needs by converting the
product manager strategy into concrete
activities
the why who and what are the
responsibility of the product manager
their roles reach might vary greatly or
be very constrained based on a variety
of variables on the other hand a product
owner's scope is often smaller than a
product manager's product owners are in
charge of the how
artifacts like a product roadmap a
product vision card or a product
requirement document are frequently the
responsibility of product managers
product backlogs Sprint backlogs and the
definition of done are just a few
examples of the artifacts that product
owners must create and manage
product managers May oversee the product
Discovery procedure enabling team
participation
but on the other hand many of the
product ceremonies that take place
throughout the product life cycle such
as Sprint planning and backlog grooming
also include product owners
the product manager is very
knowledgeable about consumer goals and
how to ease their problems
and the development team's customer
expert is the product owner
the multi-disciplinary product team is
led by the product manager they are
ultimately in charge of achieving
business and product objectives and also
report progress to executives
whereas the implementation activities
are overseen by the product owner on the
development team to decide which
features the development team will focus
on next they collaborate closely with
the product manager and other product
team members
based on client feedback the product
manager fine tunes and modifies the
product strategy and vision
but product owners make sure that
consumers opinions are considered when
choices about various products are made
within the company
long-term customer support and
continuous product capabilities are
priorities for product managers
whereas product Sprints and releases
continue to get product owners short to
midterm attention
plans and important business results are
the responsibility of the product
manager
delivering value to the end users is the
responsibility of the product owners
product managers must communicate with
the product teams even if they are
customer facing they must work on
wireframes and prototypes and attend
scrum sessions this is because it's up
to PMS to determine the overarching
vision making it crucial to collaborate
closely with the product teams
and product owners need to comprehend
and sympathize with client needs if they
don't have this every product they
develop will continue to overlook
different client pain issues
now the next phase is knowing the switch
in the roles of a product manager and
product owner
so the first question that arises is can
a product manager be a product owner
a product manager's role encompasses
end-to-end product management including
feature functionality product Road
mapping and reacting to customer input
in addition to product development and
scrum a product manager can also be a
product owner because they have a common
objective while the two jobs have the
same goal of recognizing client needs
and turning those needs into
technological requirements their
respective Scopes and objectives differ
leaders must thus decide which of these
product Specialists their company
requires
and in same ways the next question is
can a product owner be a product manager
so the answer is a product manager and
owner can be the same individual there
are undoubtedly many duties and
objectives that overlap with both jobs
but because of this it makes it logical
that many businesses utilize a single
person to meet the requirements of both
positions and use the scrum product
owner as an agile product manager as
Roman Pilcher points out but the thing
that comes next in our mind is does an
organization need both roles
instead of the titles that will be used
the true question regarding what a firm
requires must start with what the
desired product outcome is
prioritizing business value comes first
followed by evaluating the
responsibilities and procedures of the
product management team to support those
objectives a business system that lacks
flexibility frequently has structures
and processes built into it a review of
current work assignments obstacles to be
overcome the overall decision-making
process and the desired outcome are all
necessary a better understanding of the
businesses operations will exist once
all of these issues have been evaluated
solved and prioritized you will be able
to identify any issues delays or subpar
product management
you could discover that there are new
ways in which you can acclimate to the
product management framework it is
possible to combine product ownership
and management with other tasks such as
product marketing
now coming to the end of our session
let's discuss the salary of product
manager and product owners
the average salary of a product manager
in India is 10 locks per annum and in
the U.S is 90 000 to 160 000 US dollars
per annum
the average salary of a product owner in
India is 13 Lux and in the U.S is
approximately one lakh US dollars per
annum
