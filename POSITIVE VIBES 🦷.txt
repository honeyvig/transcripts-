how will you start the preparation degli
when they'll pop it then a hobby you
start by stuck in the textbook what is
the purpose of my preparation my
question is I don't have much time so as
a defenseman Oxus and whatever thinking
is next to me I used to knit for
textbooks then I used to do bits that's
it
and I used to follow the disgusting baby
and after doing all that let's go and
see that is different then what other
things are new to manage to write that
things for me if you don't believe and
if you just see the discretion
everything is new video and you'll write
everything based on time according to me
