meta the fs behind Facebook just made
their AI super smart they released a new
version called llama 3.1 this latest
version of their llama series of large
language models come with several
exciting updates one of the biggest
improvements from llama 3 to Lama 3.1 is
enhanced support for non-english
languages previously llama 3's training
data was 95% English resulting in less
impressive performance in other
languages with 3.1 update the model now
supports German French Italian
Portuguese Hindi Spanish and Tha
language as well making it much more
versatile and effective for Global
audiences another significant upgrade is
in context window the amount of text the
model can consider at once llama 3 had
an 8K token limit around 6,000 words but
Lama 3.1 boost this to a modern 128k
tokens this this makes it competitive
with other state-of-the-art language
models allowing it to handle much larger
chunks of text and deliver more coherent
and contextually aware responses now
talking about the best part anyone can
share the smart AI meta is sharing it
with everyone and in the end of this
video we will cover that also so stay

Ado let's get started so what is Lama
3.1 so llama 3.1 is an exciting update
to the Llama 3 model which was initially
announced in April 2024 this point
update brings several enhancements and
improvements to already impressive
capabilities of Lama 3 the Flagship
version of llama 3.1 known as llama 3.1
45b is particularly noteworthy due to
its massive scale as the name suggests
the version boast an astounding 405
billion parameters making it one of the
most powerful models available so the
increase in parameters allows Lama 3.1
to handle more complex task with greater
accuracy and efficiency this means it
can understand and generate humanlike
text even better than its predecessors
whether it's for natural language
processing machine translations or any
other applications Lama 3.1
45b is designed to deliver Top Notch
performance one of the key benefits of
Lama 3.1 is its ability to learn from
vast amounts of data which helps it
generate more contextually relevant and
coherent responses this makes it
invaluable tool for developers and
researchers working on Advanced a
applications so this was about Lama 3.1
now let's understand how it actually
works so Lama
31045 B is an advanced language model
built upon a standard decoder only
Transformer architecture a design that
has proven successful for many large
language models meta has introduced
slight enhancement to this score
structure to improve the model's ability
and performance during training one
notable adjustment is the intentional
exclusion of the mixture of experts that
ISE so this Moe architecture helps in
prioritizing stability and skill ability
so here's how 3.1 405b works so the
model starts by breaking down the input
text into smaller units called tokens so
these tokens are then transformed into
numerical representations known as token
embeddings which capture the essence of
each token in a format that model can
work with so these embeddings are then
processed through several layers where
the model examines the relationships
between different tokens this allows the
model to understand the context and and
significance of each token in the input
text ensuring it captures the nuances
and details accurately so the processed
information is then further refined
through Network that combines and
interprets the data to drive deeper
meaning this step is repeated multiple
times helping the model to develop a
thorough understanding of the input text
finally the model generates a response
one token at a time using the context
from previous tokens to create a
coherent and relevant output this method
known as Auto aggressive decoding
ensures that the generated text flows
naturally and makes sense in context so
this was about the working of Lama 3.1
now let's have a look at its safety
measures So Meta places a significant
emphasis on ensuring the safety of their
Lama 3.1 models before releasing Lama
3.1 45b they conducted extensive red
teaming exercises in this exercises
internal external experts act as
advisories trying to find ways to make
the model behave in harmful or
inappropriate ways so this helps
identify potential risk or
vulnerabilities in the Models Behavior
so in addition of predeployment testing
Lama 3.1 405b under goes safety fine
tuning so this process involves
techniques like reinforcement learning
from Human feedback where the model
learned to align its responses with
human values and preferences this helps
mitigate harmful or biased outputs
making the model safer and more reliable
for real world use cases meta also
introduced Lama Guard 3 a new
multilingual safety model designed to
filter and flag harmful or inappropriate
content generated by Lama 3.1 so this
additional layer of protection helps
ensure that the model output adhere to
ethical and safety guidelines another
safety feature is prompt guard which
aims to prevent prompt injection attacks
so these attacks involve inserting
malicious instructions into into user
prompts to manipulate the model's
Behavior prompt guard filters out such
instructions safeguarding the model from
potential misuses all right so this was
about the safety measures now let's
understand the use cases of Lama 3.1 so
while the Llama 3.1 often steals the
spotlight with its immerse size and
power the Llama 3.1 family includes
other models that are equally impressive
yet tailored for different needs and
resource constraints so these models
leverage the same advanced technology as
405b model but are designed to
efficiently handle specific tasks so
first is Healthcare assistant imagine
you have a chronic illness and need
constant monitoring and advice so Lama
3.1 can help by providing personalized
health tips reminding you to take your
medication and even interpreting your
health data to alert you and your doctor
about the potential issues before they
become serious next is language learning
if you're trying to learn a new language
Lama 3.1 can act as your language
partner it can help with grammar
vocabulary pronunciation and even
culture nuances you can practice
conversation and get instant feedback
next one is data analysis and
visualization for data scientists Lama
3.1 can assist in cleaning and
pre-processing data performing complex
analysis and generating visualizations
so it can suggest the most relevant
statistical methods and provide
interpretations of the results then
there is devops automation in devops
Lama 3.1 can automate various stages of
cicd pipeline monitor systems
performance and optimize deployment
processes so it can also predict
potential system failures and suggest
preventive measures so this was about it
so now let's discuss about Lama
317b so imagine needing a versatile tool
that balances performance and efficiency
that's Lama
317b is for you it's excellent for a
variety of applications whether you need
to summarize lengthy articles create
multilingual conversational agents or
get some coding assistance despite being
smaller than the massive 405b model the
70b model still holds its ground in
various benchmarks it competes well with
other models of similar size but open
and closed its more compact size make it
easier to deploy and manage on standard
Hardware making it practical choice for
many users so the next one is Lama 3.18
B
so let's discuss it so if the speed and
minimal resource consumption are what
you are after The Llama 3.1 8B is the
model to go for it's lightweight and
highly efficient making it ideal for
scenarios where computational resources
are limited like on edge devices or
mobile platforms despite the smaller
size the 8B model delivers competitive
performance it's quick and efficient
perfect for task where you need to
balance performance with resources
constraint
whether you are using it on smartphone
or a low power device it handles the job
efficiently so while the 405 model gets
a lot of attention the Lama 3.1 family
offers these other models that are
tailored to fit specific needs and
constraints now let's understand how to
access this Lama 3.1 that is the
interesting part so you can access the
Lama 3.1 45 model to a few different
platforms depending on where you are and
what you need So Meta AI and WhatsApp is
the first one if you are in US you can
use Lama 345b directly on meta a website
or even through WhatsApp all you need to
do is to sign in with your Facebook or
Instagram account and you are good to go
that's it next one is hugging chat for
those outside the US hugging chat is a
great option they host the Lama 345b
model and the best part is you don't
even need to sign up just start chatting
all right now com coming to the third
one that is Gro grq so another platform
that offers access to Lama 3.1 models
including the 405b version is Gro so it
is a solid choice if you're looking for
a reliable way to use this model next
one is Amazon Sage maker jump start and
Amazon Bedrock if you're into more
