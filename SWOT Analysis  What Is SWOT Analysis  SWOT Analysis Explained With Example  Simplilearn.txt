you will participate in several sessions
during your MBA to examine numerous
business models these sessions will
enable you to comprehend the positives
and negatives of the best business
strategies out there and by analyzing
these models you will become able to
address flaws in businesses that needs
to be resolved and the tool that
frequently comes up in the business
environment to analyze different
projects businesses and strategies is
the swart analysis so in today's session
we'll discover this swart analysis
technique in detail but before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our YouTube
channel and hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update from Simply learn the
topics that we are going to discuss are
what is swart analysis what do different
quadrants or sections in the swap Matrix
or diagram means here we'll also
discover the factors that can be
included in these sections and finally
we'll cover the sort analysis for the
most emerging automobile organization
Tesla the first topic we have is what is
swart analysis the swart analysis is the
tool that a company uses to complete
objective analysis it is vital component
of every strategic plan the term swart
stands for strengths weaknesses
opportunities and threats a SWAT Matrix
or diagram comprised of all these four
factors examines a project Pro or
business venture by emphasizing on each
of the business aspects it typically
consists of four quadrants one for each
area but the exact shape may vary
depending on the design the strengths
and weaknesses of sort analysis are
considered as internal factors whereas
opportunities and threats are external
factors the factors whose control lies
in hands of organization are considered
as internal factors and the factors
which are Beyond company's control are
regarded as external factors this SW
approach is quite beneficial in order to
decide on whether to embark on a
specific project or plan by visualizing
the pros and cons by clearly outlining
all the positives and negatives of a
project sort analysis makes it easier to
decide how to move forward for
formulating a thoros swart analysis
companies have to research what things
they are good at and not so good at
moving forward we'll Del over all the
sections of SW Technique One By One The
first one we have is strength strengths
are things in which a firm performs well
or in a way that sets it apart from
competitors in this section of swort
analysis you are supposed to think about
the advantages your organization has
over the competition these things are
the specific actions that a company does
that no other competition is doing
better than them basically this is the
thing that the company is known for for
example Walmart in us or dmart in India
both these businesses perform
exceptionally well because they maintain
a very low cost for daily groceries or
Goods this allows them to do Hefty
business than their competition the
ability to keep the cost low has
transformed these companies into the
biggest corporations further their
enormous value in the market enables
them to negotiate the discount of goods
with their suppliers the amount of items
the purchase also impact on this
discount Factor thus the low prices and
brand value will be the strength of both
Walmart and dmart brand value is
something that you feel about the
company as a customer when you see their
logo website or even ad campaign this
refers to the positive emotions you have
towards the company the next strength
can be loyal customer base for instance
consider the scenario of Apple Inc this
brand has huge loyal customer base when
Apple launches a new product loyal
customers get tempted to purchase them
and hence Apple makes enormous profits
obviously Apple's optimal services and
quality experience have the prominent
Edge in maintaining this immense
customer base next up is unique
technology when a company has a more
technical sound product it's definitely
deemed to make huge profits hence unique
technology can be considered as a
strength Factor another example of
strength is skilled and focus Workforce
this is significant strength because
human resource is the greatest asset
that any company can have physical
resources and Hefty investors are other
elements that can considered as
strengths of an organization now that we
have analyzed few strengths we'll look
into the next SW factor which is
weaknesses weaknesses are the things
that company does that aren't
necessarily positive these factors can
become liability for them anything that
is not a strength of an organization can
become a weakness hence the honest
listing of all these factors is quite
important furthermore weaknesses are
also inherent features of your
organization so focus on your people
resources systems and procedures think
about what you could improve and the
sorts of practices you should avoid
picture how other people view you in
your Market do they notice weaknesses
that you are blind to take time to
examine how and why other competitors
are doing better than you what are you
lacking by analyzing these factors
thoroughly you'll be able to list all
weaknesses which need proper attention
negative brand recognition can be
considered as a one weakness companies
that have poor customer service and are
widely known for same must consider this
issue as significant weakness because
people will think twice before buying a
product from such a company things like
low turnover inadequate supply chain are
also the subsequent negative factors to
consider having an unskilled Workforce
also provides a weakness because you are
committing multiple resources into
training furthermore Financial factors
such as lack of capital and high depths
are also amongst huge weaknesses now
that we have covered both internal
factors we'll look into the external
factors the first external Factor we
have is opportunity opportunities are
chances or prospects for something
positive to happen but you'll need to
claim them for yourself the
opportunities generally arise from the
situation outside your organization they
might develop in the market you serve or
in the technology you use the abilities
of your company to compete and take the
lead in your Market may make a big
difference in identifying and seizing
opportunities the most notable and vital
example of opportunity is market growth
for example consider a scenario of
covid-19 pandemic in this pandemic time
the sale of Doo 650 tablet increased
significantly and the manufacturing
brand micr Labs received a reasonable
profit for the same that is why it is
critical to look at Future opportunities
that may arise in your Market these
opportunities don't need to be game
changers even small chances can increase
your organization's competitiveness you
should also take care of modifications
to your fill related government policies
and changes in Social patterns
demographic profiles lifestyle Etc these
factors can also throw few opportunities
to seize on your way to the top the
final Factor we have is threat threats
include everything which might have
negative impact on your business it's
essential to foresee and act against all
the risk before you become victim of
them and stagnate your graph of growth
in this threat section of sort analysis
consider the barriers you encounter
while marketing and selling your goods
and jot them down here you might also
notice that quality standards of your
specification for your products are also
changing and that you'll need to change
those products if you are to stay in the
lead the excellent example of thread can
be increased competition for instance
consider a scenario of Starbucks
Starbucks is one of the biggest coffee
seller brand in in the world and it has
highest cost for almost all the products
now if you consider the global coffee
Market you'll find Brands like Cafe
Coffee Day dunin donuts with lower
prices and coming with region specific
test thus the business of Starbucks
might get impacted by this competing
Brands the next example of threat can be
a natural disaster like flood drought or
earthquake these phenomenons can impact
economies of different geographies and
hence the businesses out there next we
have is a rising cost of raw materials
and low Human Resources these factors
can also pose a threat to business as
the rising cost will affect production
and insufficient Human Resources will
make the company's operation completely
difficult on that note we have covered
all the sections of SW analysis now
moving ahead we'll formulate a sample
SWAT analysis for understanding this
technique more clearly the sample SWAT
analysis we are going to do is for one
of the leading automobile company Tesla
so let's dive directly into that we fill
all these sections of SWAT Matrix one by
one let's begin with strengths Tesla was
formed in 2003 with the goal of being
the world's first successful pure
electric car manufacturer it also
aspires to be one of the two US
automakers that have not declared
bankruptcy the other one being Ford the
biggest strength of Tesla is that it has
strong brand value and after all who
hasn't heard of Tesla right so it
definitely has strong brand recognition
it is the world's most well-known
manufacturer of electric vehicles
moreover Tesla has a significant age
over other firms that are set to enter
this sector furthermore Elon Musk
Tesla's iconic CEO and major shareholder
is one of the world's most renowned
influential and appealing businessman
around the world his ability to sell the
story and illicit audience participation
is remarkable people who constantly
observe his business are more inclined
to become his clients and this is
something really Priceless for a company
in long run the next advancement Tesla
has over the competition is that it is a
leading electronic car vendor not only
that but actually Tesla is the first
company to launch a complete electric
vehicle moreover many consumers like
Tesla's pioneering attitude the
capabilities of autopilot mode as well
as the level of luxury provided by Tesla
vehicles are two of the main reasons why
people admire Tesla eye-catching
Aesthetics along with Energy Efficiency
and good customer experience explain
Tesla's premium price and distinct
competitive approach the next strength
we have is Tesla's USB USP is the
acronym for Unique selling proposition
it is a distinct advantage that
distinguishes your company from others
in your industry Tesla's USB is one of
the most deliberate and thoughtful one
it speaks volumes about preserving the
global environment by removing gasoline
or petroleum powered cars from the
equation Tesla sells a story a story of
an organization which is in business
with the illustrative purpose of
preserving the global environment
probably this is Tesla 's most valuable
strength in my view along with that the
cars manufactured by Tesla are ahead of
the competition in terms of battery
range experience with battery production
and battery recharging not only that but
Tesla already has a plan in motion to
make it the most extensive battery
producer in the world the company has
created several Giga factories three in
us one in Europe and one in shangai they
are also trying to open one new Giga
Factory in Indian market and this is
going to ultimately provide a
competitive age or competition in terms
of battery production and its cost all
these factors will do wonders in
idealistic future world but right now in
fossil fuel dominated World there are
few downsides to consider for this
business hence moving forward we'll
discuss the weaknesses of Tesla Tesla is
a trail braer in its area however some
may consider Alon mus decision to make
all their patents open source to be
naive and unrealistic this could be
disastrous for the firm in Long Run
since it will be unable to defend its
invention from the competition the next
weakness we have is experimental and
complex procedures the greatest the
amount of innovation the larger the
mechanical problem and risk components
in the manufacturing process when it
comes to introducing a new vehicle and
other Goods Tesla has been troubled with
launch delays manufacturing problems and
sluggish productive ramps Tesla has been
able to compete with the world's major
automobile makers in a relatively short
period of time but it's man
manufacturing post is comparatively
smaller than others The Firm only has
one Factory in California and it can
only build a limited number of
automobiles quarterly for instance at
the time of model X launch Tesla has
several manufacturing issues resulting
in ongoing distribution delays similarly
the company experienced significant
challenges in developing the battery
module assembly process for the model X
at gigafactory 1 located in US it caused
delays in the delivery of older models
and is still one of the most severe Giga
concerns since it is unable to attain
High manufacturing quantities this is
the biggest weakness that Tesla needs to
overcome to remain the leader in its
industry the next weakness is the price
range of Tesla products one of the
significant challenges that Tesla will
continue to face is the price of
electric vehicles and customer trust as
mentioned earlier higher the level of
innovation the greater the mechanical
complexity and Manufacturing risk when
Tesla debutes new automobiles It suffers
ongoing delays in manufacturing and
production the customers of Tesla have
reported problems such as suspension
issue touchscreen issue incompatibility
of autopilot mode in some instances and
difficulty with Phantom braking system
with this we have addressed both
internal aspects of Tesla SWAT analysis
following that we'll look at the few
present prospects that Tesla can evolve
over time the first prospect that Tesla
can foresee in future is electric cars
are the future of Transportation Market
that is something that most people agree
on the only question is when will this
shift take place many individuals
anticipate that this will happen within
the next 10 years and those involved in
gasoline powered cars believe that this
change will not occur for next 40 years
one thing is for sure the faster the
transition for electric vehicles the
better it is for Tesla as consumers
transition to electric vehicles the firm
is well positioned to capture a
significant market share in the
favorable scenarios this will be the
tremendous for Tesla so this is
unquestionably a huge future opportunity
next up is the need for expanding the
business outside us the world's two
largest vehicle markets the United
States and China account for the VST
bulk of Tesla sales however whereas the
United State account for 70% of Tesla
sales China contributes do 1.8 billion
accounting for less than 10% overall
sales Asian countries are the world's
fastest growing markets focusing more on
Asian countries particularly India and
China can significantly expand Giga
sales and establish Tesla as the global
leader for that to happen Tesla will
really have to exploit the Asian market
Elon Musk has already introduced Tesla
to the Indian market by opening their
first Outlet however the magnitude of
the efforts is not that great hence this
is definitely a vital opportunity for
Tesla in the coming time additionally
Tesla has a few other opportunities such
as economies of scale and scope econom
iies of skill indicates that the
organization should expand its
production quantities while decreasing
its market value this will help the firm
to reach larger number of customers
specifically those in the middle class
economy now finally we'll discuss the
possible threats that Tesla might
encounter in the upcoming time the first
one is intensity of competition that has
evolved for Tesla these days Tesla faces
severe competition from alternative fuel
vehicles as well as self-driving
Technologies many luxury automakers such
as Mercedes-Benz BMW Audi and Lexus as
well as those in the mass Market such as
Toyota Ford Volvo and General Motors are
bracing for fierce competition despite
Tesla's reputation as a Pioneer in the
electric vehicle industry its
competitors who have been in a market
for hundreds of years have also quickly
caught up with Electric Car Technology
furthermore their cheapest cost May
tempt Tesla's buyers in the future event
even though Tesla seems to be the sole
manufacturer of high-end automobiles
other firms May begin producing vehicles
for the same client base placing Tesla
in a very competitive position many
companies are creating or planning to
launch environmental friendly
self-driving Technologies with the goal
of selling them at a reduced cost it is
prominent issue to a company like Tesla
which relies on its unique value for new
cars that are extremely costly and
Beyond of reach of many people the next
threat is claimed due to problem with
product quality the automobile industry
in particular is accustomed to
significant product liability claims
Tesla has launched several self-driving
vehicles and not all of them have proven
to be safe in the case of accident
several lawsuits have been brought
against the company due to technical
flaws and its products if these
liability claims are followed Tesla May
face more severe financial implications
thus something of more Assurance should
be done to recheck all technical aspects
of new arriving Tesla vehicles the last
threat that Tesla might come across is
the shortest of necessary materials the
corporation uses aluminium steel lithium
nickel copper Cobalt and lithium ion
cells from vendors across the globe the
recent events in Afghanistan have also
impacted adversely in the supply of
lithium hence the shortage of materials
can be the most devastating Rising
concern for Tesla that's all we have for
the spot analysis of Tesla I hope now
you guys are clear about how you you can
perform the SWAT analysis that's all we
have for today now if you have any
