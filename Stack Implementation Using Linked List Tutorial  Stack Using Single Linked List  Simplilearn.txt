hello everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about linked list implementation
using stack but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies if you are a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with our session for today
so first up what exactly is a linked
list
so linked list is a dynamic data
structure it allocates memory
dynamically the nodes are maintained in
a non-continuous memory that is in
linked list we have nodes so each and
every node is connected via a pointer
which points to the address of the next
node
each node contains next pointer that is
the next pointer's address which keeps
the reference to the next node and it
also has another section which stores
the data the topmost note always
contains null in its address
and this is how a linked list looks like
so this is the top which is the
beginning position of the linked list
and this is the address of the first
location and this is the next node this
is the following node then this is the
last node and this points back to the
head node so this is how you can
implement a stack like data structure
using linked list you can see that we
can perform stack like operation that is
the elements are located one above the
other and the top is pointing to the
head node
now let us go through the implementation
of stack using linked list first we will
go through traversing of stack using
linked list
so displaying each node of the linked
list representing stack is termed as
traversing copy the head pointer to the
temporary pointer and then move
temporary node through all the nodes and
display values of each node
so you can see the animation here will
explain you how the traversal goes
through the linked list in real time
now another linked list implementation
of stack as the push operation
so adding a new node to the top of the
stack is termed as push operation
generally in stack we have three
operations that is push pop and peak so
one of the operation is push where you
add an element into the stack in the
same way using linked list you can add a
new node to the stack and point it as
the top of the stack or the first
element which represents the top in
terms of stack
now create a node first and allocate a
new memory to it if the list is empty
and node consists of data and null is
the address it will be inserted as the
first node
if there is some node already existing
then add a new node at the beginning to
avoid violations
so the following animation will help you
understand how we add a new element or
the top element to the stack using
linked lists
now followed by the push operation we
have the pop operation
so now let us go through the pop
operation
removing a node from the top of the
stack is termed as pop operation
in the same way we will be eliminating
the first node from the linked list
which is termed as top
underflow condition may occur when you
try to remove the node if the stack is
already empty
in stack node can be removed from one
end only therefore the value stored in
the headpointer must be deleted and the
node must be freed
followed by the pop operation we have
the peak operation
retrieving the topmost node of the
linked list representing stack without
removing the linked list node from the
top of the stack is termed as peak
operation generally when you're using a
stack data structure just retrieving the
value of the top node is called as peak
operation you're not going to eliminate
or you're not going to add a new element
to the top you're just going to copy the
element or you're just going to retrieve
the element which is pointed as top this
operation is called as p
now in the linked list you can also
perform this operation of peak
now with the theory discussed let us
execute a practical program based on
stack implementation using linked list
now on my screen you can see a code
example using which we will implement
stack using a linked list now here we
have the pop operation push operation
and top and then the main function
don't worry about the code this
particular code snippet will be attached
in the description box below or you can
also request us and we will have it sent
to your mail id and you can understand
the code and try executing in your local
system now without further ado let's
directly run the code
so there you go the code got
successfully compiled and we have tried
to add some elements into the stack that
is a b c and c is being the top most
element of the stack and that element
has got popped and followed by that the
element on the top currently after c
being popped out is b and the node
element b got popped again and the only
element which is present in the stack is
a and that element is also popped out
after performing the pop operation and
now currently the stack is empty you can
see that we have tried to push the
elements a b c and also we try to pop
the elements a b
now with that we have come to an end of
this particular tutorial on
implementation of stack using linked
list if you have any queries regarding
the topics covered in this tutorial or
if you need the code that we have
executed in this particular tutorial
then please feel free to write us down
in the comment section below and we will
be happy to help you out until next time
