once you dive into the world of cyber
security it becomes clear that there are
many certifications to choose from some
of these are relatively easy to obtain
While others are known to be extremely
challenging the difficulty of these
exams basically depends on few things
like how much you know how much time you
put into studying and the hands-on
experience you have in the field some
people Breeze through the toughest
certification without breaking the sweat
while others might struggle with them
but here's the thing it's really hard to
rank how difficult a certification is
because testing organizations don't
always share the Pass rates for their
exams despite this there is plenty of
talk in the industry about Vis
certification is the hardest one so
based on the discussions and insight
from cyber Security Experts we have put
together a list of eight most
