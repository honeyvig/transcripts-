hi this is dr srikan from team mds
conquer
i'm just going to give a brief glance of
what
you need to do when you are reading the
subject
oral radiology so coming to oral
radiology
so oral radiology
according to me i can consider this as
one of the easiest
simplest and shortest subject
among the list of the subjects you
prepare for entrance exam so coming to
the neat blueprint
so integrated need has given a decent
blueprint
in which along with oral medicine the
radiology is going to carry 14 so i'm
going to allocate
seven to eight marks for radiology in
the need
and if you are planning for i n i c 80
so it has a similar weight is of around
8 to 10 squaring in and around 8 to 10
squaring
maybe radiology may be integrated with
any of the case-based questions or any
of the diagram based questions
where they are going to give you
radiographic features and they may ask
you to
interrupt the x-ray so this is all about
the blueprint so it has a decent weight
is
and i strongly recommend at least a 40
hours
of preparation for this particular
subject
okay so 40 hours of preparation has to
be done and of course as i already said
radiographic
futures are the things which you are to
focus means
you have a special topics in oral
radiology called as
radiographic diagnosis okay in which
radiographical features will be there
so it may be integrated in most of the
situations with oral medicine
in oral path it can be integrated you
pedo they can ask you questions related
to the radiographic features
surgery has lots of important for
radiology
similarly your endo radiographic
diagnosis of
endo or radiographic or findings in the
case of your operating
industry that is your carries so
everything has a greater importance so
the radiographic features are one of the
strong findings that every dental
clinician has to know
of course you are well well familiar
about this so similarly
most of the questions can be integrated
with radiology and finally i can
conclude that
radiology is a very very very very
important subject
and of course if you are good you can
finish it as fast as possible
so coming to the topics that you need to
cover
in uh radiology so i want to divide the
topics into two parts
one category are very very important
which i'm going to mark with red
so such category is your radiation
physics
your radiation biology your
projection geometry and intraoral
radiographic techniques
your x-ray films your processing
and their errors your extraordinarily
radiographic
and at most important thing is going to
be your radiographic diagnosis
okay and of course because nowadays
exams are being drifted and moving
towards the advances right
so advances part uh i want to talk about
all these
radiographic advances like your mri cbct
your ct scans of course your kovid 19
again your ct scan is very important
your core ads and all these are going to
be a part of your medical radiology
even radiotherapy for few of the
carcinomas
radiotherapy what type of radiotherapy
is being whether it is teletherapy that
is whether it is brachytherapy
okay so there are many types of
radiotherapy techniques which are a part
of your
medicine carcinoma treatment one part of
carcinoma treatment is radiotherapy
right
so the radiotherapy part is also
important in examination point of view
so keeping in mind the upcoming trends
the trends in the examination like if
you
see the trend in the exam from
previous exams to the 2020 or 2021 so
there are lots of questions moving on
the things which are commonly used in
your clinical scenario they're asking
so if you come to such clinical scenario
i strongly recommend to add one more
star to the topics like projection
geometry
i want to add one more star your
radiographic films what is happening
processing errors errors and processing
techniques
of course your extra overall radiography
which technique has to be given for
which particular condition radiographic
diagnosis
is very important and of course i'll
i'll keep more stars for this advanced
radiology
and medical related radiology where your
mcq books are
less filled with mcqs related to this
that's what i'm i'm always telling like
right now you cannot only rely on the
mcq books to
end up with a decent rank because
advanced updates advanced things which
are going right now in the clinical
scenario
most of the mcq books are missing it
okay so
uh i want you guys to add such
strong topics and make you make make
your concept strong that's going to help
you
to survive in dentistry and second thing
this is going to help you in the
examination hall also
right so these are the contents that you
have to cover and of course
uh the reference book like whenever you
want reference
the first source of reference book
should be
white and for all of us like whatever
the book you have read in your final
year that's okay you can keep it as
a reading book whenever you want you can
go back and read that's not an issue but
whenever you want to find a reference to
something whenever you want to have a
clarity over something
that can be a controversial question
that can be a key correction in in the
normal mcq books whatever you're doing
make sure you try to go with white and
pharaoh only
okay so and of course as i already said
there was like somewhere around like 20
25 odd pages of synopsis
well-organized synopsis which is
prepared from white and ferrous right
away from your
power playbook volume 3. so your
powerplaybook volume 3 has radiology
and it has mcqs also integrated with the
oral medicine and oral path somewhere
around 850 mcqs
are there with lots of diagrams lots of
radiographic diagrams
apart from that you have 25 pages of
synopsis of oral radiology
which has to be done thoroughly very
very important synopsis okay
right so that's all about i want to talk
about the pp books so 850 mcqs
okay uh which are integrated with oral
path and oral medicine and followed by
25 pages or 20 to 25 pages or synopsis
of oral radiology
prepared from white and pharaoh
including tables flowcharts
all important aspects were condensed and
included in this so it is mandatory that
you have to do this
top to bottom clear right so coming to
the
sequence of things what you have to do
if you are a student of mds conquer the
first thing
i want to stress on is your smart videos
okay so first thing you have to do your
smart videos you have a decent number of
10 to 15 smart videos and further i'm
going to update you as many smart videos
as possible
covering the radiographic features like
predicting there will be more
radiographical
features integrated with the case based
on radiographical features as a diagram
based questions
in the in the need or ini cet so we'll
try to
upload as number as many number of
videos as possible
but make sure you try to finish all the
video contents that are available on the
website
so make sure the first level of reading
should be the video content
with the pp books 25 pages content
and whatever the little synopsis that is
available in your normal mcq books
whatever mcq books
you're doing do the synopsis part
so once you're done with this and once
your core concepts are strong and once
you are confident then i want you guys
to go to the
mcqs part and do it okay you do whatever
mcq book you have
whichever preferable mcq book you want
to follow you do the mcqs for the
particular topic from the mcq book
along with the explanation part so once
you're done with that evening you can
attend uh the activity on the group
where where we are going to have some
sort of textbook reading
updated contents of the textbook reading
will have some contents of updated
content so the textbook reading in the
evening activity
and followed by you can plan your uh
topic specific exam
okay so this is what the sequence that
you have to follow i'm just repeating
the sequence again
first i want you guys to do your smart
video content with the synopsis of the
mcq book or
with the 25 pages synopsis of the pp
book content then solve mcqs with
explanations
from any of the book then we'll have an
activity okay every day we'll have a few
30 to 40 minutes activity on the group
with some sort of textbook reading
okay some some mcqs recent mcqs and
everything revision
and followed by i want you guys to do
the topic specific
video a topic specific exam of that
particular subject
right so this is what the brief outline
of radiology
open radiology is simple easy and i hope
you'll do it
at your best done for now signing off dr
