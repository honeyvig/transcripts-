what's up Traders I'm Kevin Hart and in
today's video I'm going to be showing
you how to install Pine connector into
metatrader 4 so that we can automate our
trading view scripts now I've already
done a video on metatrader 5 that is the
platform I will be using personally to
go through the rest of this series but
for those of you who have a broker that
does not offer metat trator 5 or you
prefer metat trator 4 I'm going to
quickly show you how to set up Pine
connector for this platform now if you
want to know more information about Pine
connector go and watch the metatrader 5
version even though it shows you how to
install Pine connector on metatrader 5 I
also go into a lot of information about
what Pine connector is and how it
functions and I'm going to skip all of
that for this video to keep it really
brief I don't want to repeat myself
unnecessarily so if you're new to Pine
connector and you have no idea what it
is go and check that out uh the metat
trator 5 version of this instructional
video now before we continue I need to
mention that this is not trading advice
I'm not a financial adviser this is
risky stuff if you don't know what
you're doing if you're not a competent
Trader I recommend you stay away from
Pine connector or at least spend a lot
of time on the demo account before you
even consider uh live trading using this
expert advisor there is a lot that can
go wrong you can lose money very quickly
if you don't know what you're doing but
in this video series on Pine connector I
will walk you through each step of the
way and for those of you who are
comfortable with the risks involved in
automated trading we will automate a
script by the end of this series I can't
promise it'll be profitable cuz it's an
example script but I will show you guys
how to set up a fully automated script
through trading View and pine connector
so that you can execute trades on your
broker while you sleep anyway with that
out of the way let's continue with the
instructions let's download the windows
version of metatrader 4 and let's
install this onto my system next and
then click finish we can close this tab
I need to select server 01 next existing
trade account paste in my um metatrader
account number I'm going to change these
account numbers these are demo accounts
anyway way um but if you're doing this
yourself don't give this number out uh
because people can try to screw around
with your account so click finish to log
in hopefully this
works there we go incoming mail there we
go we have logged in and once again we
need to turn off these obnoxious sound
effects so I'm going to go to tools
options events and stop that click okay
there we go all right so let's jump over
to the Pine connector instructions and
download the metatrader 4 expert advisor
for Pine connector so here I am on my
members portal the first thing I need to
do is change my account number because
I've already set this up on metatrader 5
so if I go to file uh login copy this
number and paste it in here now my
license will work with this new
metatrader account number now you need
to use your own metatrader account
number number this will not work with my
number it needs to be the one you've
logged into your platform with so now
that I've done that I need to download
the metatrader 4 expert advisor so I can
open this folder up right click this EX4
file cut open up metatrader go to file
open data folder then we need to go into
mql4 experts and paste this file into
here now I can open up my expert
advisors tab down here right click on
this and click refresh and here is our
Pine connector expert advisor but before
we use this we need to change a few
settings so we need to come up to tools
options um expert advisors we need to
click to allow automated trading and we
also need to allow these dll Imports now
this allows expert advisers to do things
like access the internet outside of the
platform which is required for uh Pine
connector if you're not comfortable with
this make sure to reach out to the Pine
connector support team to discuss any
apprehensions you have but personally I
trust these guys I've used them for a
couple of years now so I'm going to
allow that click okay and the final
thing we need to do is make sure this is
turned on make sure this is green um now
let's go through the instructions here
if I click EA guide let's make sure I
haven't missed anything we click on
metatrader 4 I've downloaded the EA I've
installed it into my data folder into
mql4 I have allowed dll Imports I have
enabled auto trading the final thing to
do is attach the pine connector EA to my
chart so I can right click this and
click attach to chart now I need to come
to commment make sure allow live trading
is turned on and allow dll Imports is
turned on as long as these two options
are on the expert advisor should be able
to execute trades through our broker
through the metatrader platform now we
need to come to inputs this is where we
put in our license ID now there'll be a
link in the video description if you
haven't used Pine connector before it's
an affiliate link so if you do sign up I
do get get a small cut of your payment
at no extra cost to you so if you want
to support the channel that's one way to
do it but if you don't want to support
the channel for whatever reason uh
that's fine to just go to the Pine
connector website and sign up for a free
trial you get a 7-Day free trial um get
your license ID from your uh the main
site dashboard so if I go to members
portal scroll down and copy this number
I can paste that into here and click
okay and now assuming I've done
everything correctly this should enable
Pine connector there we go we have
successfully connected to Pine
connector's server everything is good to
go so let's jump back over to the
instructions here I've allowed live
trading and dll imports on the expert
advisor settings tab I've inputed my
license ID we have successfully
connected to the server so our
connection is good um the final thing to
do is send a test alert to make sure
this is working correctly so first we
need to find a symbol so if we go back
to to metatrader and I go file uh or
view where is it here symbols you can
press control U on a Windows computer or
just click symbols here uh we go to FX
Majors we need to make sure that the
symbol we want to trade is enabled so if
we double click on these you can see
they turn gray that means that trading
is not enabled on these symbols and the
expert advisor Pine connector uh will
not be able to execute trades on these
symbols if we send alerts to these
symbols so we need to enable all the
markets we want to trade once these are
enabled we can click close now notice in
my symbols list we're going to send a
test command to open a long trade on
euro dollar and my euro dollar symbol in
this list has a suffix so depending on
the broker you are using you may have a
prefix or a suffix on the market you
want to trade in my case I have a suffix
which is a full stop a I need to send
this entire string to Pine connector in
my alert if I want to open a trade on
euro dollar so let's do that now let's
scroll down through the instructions we
have enabled euro dollar we have gone
over the suffix here so the final thing
to do is um copy this line
here go to trading view let me delete
the metatrader 5 test alert click ADD
alert make sure that euro dollar is
selected um I went over this in the
metat trader 5 version of this video but
it is IDE to use the same broker feed
you can see here this says pepperstone
that is the same broker I'm using on my
metatrader platform this is not
necessary you don't have to use the same
um data feed as long as you send the
correct symbol the correct
symbol oh my goodness Euro doll. a as
long as I send this to the correct link
with the correct license ID it doesn't
matter what Market I trigger this alert
on the trade will go through to Pine
connector here but obviously does help
to be using a data feed that is as close
as possible to whatever your uh
metatrader platform is using so in this
case I'm using euro dollar on metatrader
and uh trading view through pepperstone
um and the data feed is pretty close so
we shouldn't have too many issues with
trades being executed at um different
prices on both platforms so now I can
paste in what I copied from the pine
connector website and now I need to
replace my license ID and my symbol with
the corresponding parameters to trigger
an alert on euro dollar so to do that I
can come back to this page copy my
license ID I paste that in here now this
license ID again corresponds to your
metatrader account number so you can't
use my license ID don't even bother
trying you need to create your own um
but there is a one week free trial for
those of you who aren't ready to commit
any money to this and you just want to
play around make sure to sign up to the
free trial um go to your member
dashboard copy your license ID in here
buy means we are going to buy at Market
risk equals 1 means with the default um
expert advisor settings with the default
settings here uh we will go over these
settings in detail in future videos but
for now using the default settings
sending a risk equals one command will
open one standard lot on the symbol we
specify and for the symbol remember we
need to type out the um the market we
want to trade and then the suffix so a
now I need to change my condition to
greater than zero and now this alert
will trigger as soon as I create it and
price moves because obviously price will
always be greater than zero unless the
world has imploded and the euro is no
more uh but hopefully by the time you
watch this video that hasn't happened
anyway the next thing we need to do is
come to Notifications make sure web hook
URL is turned on and this link is pasted
in you can get this link from the uh
instructions here so you need to copy
this URL paste it into the web hook turn
the web hook on all of these other
settings do not matter they're optional
if you want to be notified when your
script executes a trade then you might
want to set these up when you create
your alerts but for today's test we
don't need to worry about that um and it
looks like we're good to go I'll just
change this to Pine connector test mt4
now when I click create this should
trigger immediately and we should either
get an error in the experts tab or trade
should be executed there we go it looks
like our trade executed just fine there
we go we have a trade opened we have
opened one standard lot on euro dollar
at Market um using an alert sent from
Trading view amazing stuff now if you
get an error in this experts tab uh when
you try to trigger this alert if there's
an error code here like a number then
you need to come to pinec connector.com
error and then if you you search for
your error
code um there should be a description on
what the error means and Rec and
recommendations on how to rectify that
error but we didn't get an error luckily
uh this works straight out of the box
with the default settings so I can wrap
this video up here and in future videos
we will go into more detail about the
settings of this expert advisor I'll be
doing most of my um personal examples on
metatrader 5 but you guys should be able
to follow along on metatrader 4 if
you're using metatrader for because
these settings are pretty much identical
on both platforms with all that said
I'll wrap this video up here I'll speak
with you in the next one take care and
good luck with your
training
