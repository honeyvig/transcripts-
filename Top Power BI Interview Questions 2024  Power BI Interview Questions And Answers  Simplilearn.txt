without further delay let's get started
with the interview questions for today's
session firstly the first question is
what are the different types of filters
in powerbi reports so if you are an
experienced candidate or a beginner
these type of interview questions are
the ones which are definitely going to
face so coming to the answer what are
the types of filters you'll be facing in
papia reports so there are three main
filters available in powerbi which are
visual level filters page level filters
and Report level filters which are
almost self-explanatory so if you want
to be someone who stands out out of the
group just mention a couple of more like
slices which can be also which can also
act some type of filters there right so
visual filters page filters and Report
level filters are the three main types
and if you want to add onto it you can
also add in some slices right now let's
proceed to the next
question explain DXs in PBI so what
exactly is the meaning of tax and to
improvise your question uh or to
improvise your answer or if you want to
outperform you can also explain with
some of the explanations or
implementation of Dax in your nearest
examples like if you are working if
you're a beginner or if you're a fresher
if you're working on a portfolio then
you can give the example of your tax
implementation on that portfolio or if
you're an experienced candidate just
explain your latest implementation of
Dax in your previous projects so the
answer for this question is Dax is
basically the full form for data
analysis expressions and is a Formula
language used in PBI P pivot and SQL Dax
includes functions operations and
constants that can be used as a formula
expression to calculate and written one
one or more values so Dax just
understand it in this way right so if
you are about to perform an analysis or
if you're about to extract some insights
for example you own a Superstore right
and you wanted okay let's assume that
you own a Superstore and you have five
regions north south east west and
Central and you are U providing um
products from uh few categories let's
say it mobile phones desktops everything
and now you wanted to
identify one zone which is giving you
highest sales in Mobile phones and you
wanted to identify one zone which is
giving you least sales in um mobile
phones in such scenarios you can just
write up a formula equals to um mobile
phones product and M you know product
uh minus products which are less than a
number specific number you you actually
wanted to identify a products less than
um 100 U mobile phones right you just
want to know if there is any region
which is uh selling less than 100 mobile
phones then you can extract that so the
expression what you're writing there is
nothing but a tax expression so apart
from this example you can also put up
some complex examples if you're an
experienced candidate or if you're a
fresher then you can come up with some
Dax Expressions that you buil on your
portfolio projects moving ahead we'll
discuss the third question how does
powerbi integrate with other tools and
services so there might be a situation
where you might have to get connected to
different sources of data right so let's
say you wanted to import Excel data as
well as some service like a cloud
service you want to extract data from a
cloud service as well so how can you do
that and if you want to do that can you
do it right so that's the question so
basically this is a kind of question
which comes up from two different zones
can you integrate or can you connect to
two different sources of data or in case
if you can connect how to connect right
so it's it's like is it possible to
connect there's also question to
beginners to test your knowledge on the
fundamental knowledge and prob I they
want to know if you can connect data
from two different zones it's not like
two Excel sheets they want to know from
two different platforms Al together
let's say I have data and Azure let's
say I have data and SQL so can I connect
them both yes you can do that so the
answer for this question is PBI offers
extensive integration capabilities with
various Microsoft products like Azure
Excel SQL and some third party Services
as well like a website any application
or uh database SQL databases Excel
spreadsheets and other cloud services
like gcp AWS Etc so that's possible so
you just have to let's go for a
demonstration on this not a complete
demonstration let's cancel this so here
if you just it's it's just like a
overview how to connect so here if you
see we have Excel workbook semantic
models data flows data was SQL Server
web o data feed plan query and if your
uh source is falling different from
these available ones you can just click
on more and select any one of these
options right here correct so uh with
that let's get back to the next
question what are the differences
between PBI desktop and PBI service so
the terms are self-explanatory if you're
an experienced candidate then you can
Define the answer right away but if
you're a beginner especially if you're a
fresher then you must be a little
cautious so if you are building your
portfolio if you are learning the
fundamentals of powerbi then you are
doing it using powerbi desktop right but
if you are a professional or an
experienced candidate then you are
developing the interactive dashboards
you are developing the interactive
charts and graphs and everything and you
are providing that visual only visual
only the dashboard to your end user who
is your client so in that scenario your
client will be given the powerp service
module right so they will be having a
service access only just to watch the
visuals so the answer for this question
is powerbi desktop is a free application
so it's not completely uh free so there
are in situ there are uh situations
where you might have to deal with some
huge data or you have to deal with some
uh parameters like security everything
in those scenarios you might have to go
with the licensed version so for a
learning purpose it is free application
installed on a local system that lets
you connect to transform visualize
modularize your data and few more uh
implications that you can do and on the
other hand powerb service is a
cloud-based service that allows you to
share as discussed only to share and
collaborate on uh and distribute your
power reports and uh dashboards with
others within your organization so
client is partially a part of your
organization because he has some
business to do with your organization so
basically understand it in this way
powerbi desktop is something which
allows you to build it will give you the
blocks you build the visualization and
then you give a screenshot or you give a
picture of that particular build to the
end user you can have a visual on it how
it is performing it doesn't have to
worry about how it is working in the
background he doesn't have to worry
about how big or how um large is your
data set how it is extracting what API
is it using what's the he doesn't care
about it all he cares about is the
visual how is his business doing so in
that scenario you just want to give a
picture that's when you use the power
service now let's go with the next
question how do you handle Security in
powerbi
so this is a question given to the
experienced candidates so you can think
about it about the access rowwise access
let's say you are the leadership team
and next is the manager next is the uh
individual contributor correct so here
the full access the full visuals of your
business how your business is going on
how are the leads how are the revenue
how is the RP how's the traffic
everything is visible to the uh
leadership or the manager correct but
when it comes to the IC or individual
contributor who is just working on
traffic he will have access only to
traffic not the leads not the revenue
generated not the uh RPL and everything
because he has nothing to do with it and
that is something which you can't reveal
to an IC for data security purposes so
it you can also consider this in the way
of inheritance right so uh you can
divide it based on the level of the
employee right so level wise you can
provide the access to your employee to
your manager uh if you're a developer
let's say So based on the employee level
based on the manager level based on the
leadership team you can give separate
access to separate candidate so the
answer for this question is powerbi
provides Ro level security RS which
allows you to control access so you're
basically controlling the access to the
data for different users within your
organization you can Define rules on the
data set that filter the data based on
the user R additionally PBI integrates
with Microsoft asure active directory to
provide authentication and
authorization now the sixth question
what is a Content pack and
powerbi content packs are type of
package that includes a related set of
dashboard report and data elements they
used to share insights reports and data
sets with colleagues and organization
within a broader audience powerbi also
offers organizational content packs
which allows you users to quickly
connect and analyze data from popular
business applications so basically
content pack you can imagine content
pack as a set of charts graphs or a
complete dashboard or data set elements
so when you integrate all those inside a
bubble that particular bubble can be
considered as a Content flag now moving
ahead we have the 7eventh question
describe a scenario where you improvised
performance of a powerb report so let's
say this is uh so basically before we
answer this question this question is
for an experienced candidate not for an
intermediate or not for a beginner L
right so if you are someone who has
three to four years of experience that
is when this kind of questions are
shooted so explain a scenario where you
improve the performance of a Baria
report so there are certain
scenarios where let's say you're working
with a uh business data Amazon sales
data so you have Amazon sales data or
any other data for a beginner purpose
okay let's say some XYZ company so
you're working with XYZ company and you
have a sales data from Up past couple of
years and uh your client asked you ke
last year this particular dashboard was
working fine but down the line when we
entered the new quarter or new an annual
year I can see there is some discrepancy
or I can see there is some delay for the
powerbi dashboard to load now there can
be multiple reasons for this the first
reason could be the hardware setup or uh
uh maybe the data is increasing day by
day so the hardware is not supporting so
that could be one reason and provided if
uh there are some visuals which are
already created visualizations or graphs
or dashboards and we are not most mostly
using them so those can be one of the
reasons so in these scenarios you can
just give some uh explanations which you
already faced in your current
Organization for example like you can
say uh the client is not willing willing
to uh scale up the hardware like the the
hardware which stores the data or
something like that is not ready to
scale of the hardware but he wants to
use the same Hardware but he wants you
to increase the speed in this scenarios
you can eliminate the data which is not
currently in use let's say you're using
2020 21 22 23 and 24 data now all you
focus on as the year on-ear growth so
you just need 2022 2023 and 2024 not 1
and 12 right you can erase that data
from your existing Hardware or servers
this will ease up the load on power bi
and automatically there should be an
increase in speed another one if you
have already created some visualizations
which you're not currently using let's
say you already created two to three
dashboards and you rely on One dashboard
alone not the rest of those two you can
delete those visualizations so something
like that which can help you but to
consider this question as an assignment
I would like the viewers who are an
experienced data analyst to answer the
question in your way possible so that
the viewers can benefit from multiple
answers so you can write down few
scenarios where you face this problem
and how you solved it it can be a
oneline answer it can be a points which
you can mention right a set of points
which you can mention that helped you to
improve the performance of your PP end
report so the answer for this question
which I have is in one scenario I
improve the performance is by optimizing
data model reducing the number of
unnecessary columns and rows in data
sets and dazing summary tables to
decrease the data volume that needed to
be processed I also replaced complex
calculations in the report with simple
ones which uh were possible and used
direct query mode for realtime data
requirements to speed up a report
loading times so this can be a good
answer you can also add up some answers
from your end as well to benefit the
viewers now let's go with question
number eight explain the difference
between measure and a calculated field
so this can be an important question for
freshers especially right so me
personally I've asked this question to
the candidates many times so the answer
could be a little tricky right so most
oftenly the question can be asked as
what's the difference between measure
and calculated column or measure and a
calculated field or measure and
dimension right so the answer should be
like this just pay attention to what the
answer you know interviewer is asking
you and answer wisely if he's asking you
the difference between measure and
dimension it's clear self-explanatory so
something like measure is something
which can be measured the number is a
measure let's say the salary is a
measure the average of uh marks obtained
is a measure marks obtained in a
specific subject is a measure measure
rate of interest is a measure traffic is
a measure right so when it comes to
Dimensions something like a character
data type maybe and name of the store
and let's say we didn't have we had
various regions in the previous question
north south east west central this
particular data which cannot be measured
is called as a dimension now for this
question here what's the difference
between measure and a calculated column
so calculated column is something which
you generate out of a calculated field
right whenever you try let's say you
have the quantity and you have the price
but you don't know rate of each product
correct in such scenarios you can write
up a calculated field and build a new
column called rate of product that
particular column is a calculated column
which is newly generated after writing a
calculated field so the answer for this
question is calculated column creates a
new column based on existing data using
formula it adds to your new you know
it's add to your existing table as a new
column as we discuss measure creates a
dynamic calculation that summarizes your
data measures are used in visualizations
to analyze Trends or answer specific
questions now with this let's move on to
the next question describe the process
of publishing a powerbi report to
service now this can be an answer for
both I mean this can be a question for
both fresh as well as experienced so U
now you can give it a try you can give
me the answer for this you can write
down your answers in the comment section
below and U everybody has their own way
of answering this question but as simple
as that let's keep it normal now in
powerb and desktop go to publish and
choose public vs service select the
workspace to publish and configure
settings like sharing access click
publish to upload your report of V
service so this is the answer given by
most of the experienced candidase but
when it comes to pressures it's okay if
you answer in this way create multiple
charts create multiple graphs understand
the requirement of the end user build
the require required charts and graphs
integrate all those charts and graphs to
the dashboard it's also a good way to
tell it but if you're an experienced
candidate or if you're a beginner just
try to include these points as well just
go take a step ahead and go a step
further and answer include these points
in your answer go to publish select
powerbi service select workspace right
so these will enhance your answer and
make a stand out from the other crowd
now let's continue with the 10th
question how would you handle missing
data in powerbi so this can be answered
for both you know this can be asked for
both beginners as well as U experienced
candidates so it's obvious if you're a
DAT data analyst it's obvious that your
data will not not have complete uh
completely filled rows and completely
filled columns all right there is a
possibility that you might have blank
rows there is a possibility that you
might have blank cells there is a
possibility that you might have
irrelevant data there is a possibility
where it can be a typing mistake and you
might insert special symbols in place of
numbers and special operators in place
of alphabets everything is possible so
in such scenarios how could you handle
right so there are multiple approaches
so let's say if you are going through
some column which you feel is not
mandatory to create your report you can
ignore those uh cells and you can just
delete it and uh in case of there is um
a discrepancy in your existing data and
you find that is important then you can
always have a way to go back to The
Source Who provided you the report or
Who provided you the data as to complete
them ask to give them them the right
number or in few scenarios you can also
if you don't want to eliminate any kind
of rows and columns you can also have an
option of taking an aggregate value in
it maybe the minimum value maybe the
maximum value may be an average value in
that particular missing cell so there
are multiple possibilities and if you
feel like adding those answers you can
also feel free to add them so that
everyone is benefited so uh my kind of
answer is there are several ways to hand
handle missing data filtering where you
can exclude simply that's the first one
you can just ignore those and exclude
those missing values replace missing
values with some aggregate values custom
logic create a tax formula to address
missing values based on specific
scenarios now let's move ahead with the
next question how do you connect
multiple data sources to a powerb report
so the answer is PBI allows connecting
various data sources you can directly
import directly use live connections or
create composite mod model to improve
and combine data from different sources
so this is not just the powerp dashboard
you're here I mean it's not just the
powerbi desktop you're not just
importing data it's related to the
realtime dashboard report so if you have
a report and you are ought to connect
some external Source some realtime
streaming data you can do that using
some live connections and apis now let's
move with the next
question what are data Flows In powerbi
so the answer for this question is data
Flows In powerbi are cloud-based
preparation and management tools that
allows users to ingest transform
integrate and enrich Big Data from
various sources they are designed to
simplify data preparation and enable
scalable data integration and storage
across multiple powerbi projects now the
13th question how can you handle data
updates in so this is also one of the
simplest but also the trickiest question
let's say you already connect let's say
let's we are dealing with Excel data and
your client provided you the Excel data
and you already created a dashboard out
of it and out of your knowledge you
don't know right uh you might not know
what happened after they share to the
data and the client gets to know there
there is some discrepancy there is some
irrelevant data or there is some missing
value in the data provided to you and
they add it and you missed it correct in
those scenarios how can you handle data
updates right you can either refresh
there are multiple answers for that so
let's go with the answer so data updates
in powerbi can be handled through
scheduled refreshes or realtime
streaming data sets schedule refreshes
so let's say you provide some six day or
one week or one day based on requirement
you provide a scheduled refresh and it
will uh act upon it and it will refresh
its source every single time it
basically refreshes the dashboard you
created it will extract the data from
the source and it will um create a new
report out of it so schedule refreshes
can be configured in powerbi service
allowing data to be updated at specified
intervals realtime streaming data sets
can be used for dashboard tiles that
require continuous UPG updates now the
14th question on our list can you
explain the concept of a Slicer in PBI
right so those who already are
comfortable with Excel they might know
the answer for this so it's completely
similar right so let's discuss the
answer a slicer is a powerbi
visualization used to filter the data
basically it's nothing different from
Filter right it's just an option like a
drop down that you create in Excel using
the data validation that's the same in
PBI as well as Excel you just have an
slicer option where you can provide your
selection and it will give you an ENT
report so basically it's it's a filter
so it provides a way for users to filter
the data that is displayed in other
visualization on a report page slicers
offer a more interactive and intuitive
way to make selections and see the data
that changes dynamically as selections
are made let's say you have a class 10
class 9 Class 8 and you wanted to just
check the results of Class 8 you just
select the option of Class 8 on the
slice on and you have the report so
that's how it basically works now the
last question for today's session what
is direct query in PBI so the answer for
this question is direct query is a
connection type in powerbi that allows
you to directly connect to a supported
data source enabling realtime reporting
capabilities without without importing
or copying data into powerbi while it
offers up to-date data it also limits
certain functionalities and might impact
Performance Based on the query load on
the source system so with that we have
