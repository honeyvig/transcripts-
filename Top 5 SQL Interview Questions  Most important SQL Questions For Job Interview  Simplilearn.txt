Ado let's get started so speaking about
the top five interview questions let's
quickly jump to the workbench of SQL so
I'm using my SQL workbench and here we
have a database called use simply learn
so SLP is the database name so we will
be using the use command to get access
to that particular database so we are in
access to it and now now let's quickly
check out tables show tables there you
go we have a few tables here book
collection book order employee details
joining register and employee register
so let's go with the employee
details so I'll just simply shoot a
command select
star
from
EMP details
so now we have our employee table so we
will be using this particular data set
to run few queries from our interview
questions so getting back to the
interview questions so most commonly you
will be asked the following interview
questions so the first question is you
will be asked to find out the names of
the employees that start with the vbls
so AE i w u so they will ask a question
give me the list of names that start
with these five letters it can be either
a or e or I OU right so what's the
question so here you will be using like
operators and not like operators let's
say they want the names with WS so you
can just use the like operator and use
this particular command select employee
name that's the name of the column from
employee register or employee details
and then where employee my name is like
a modulus which means it should start
with a and it can have any number of
alphabets after that right so let's
quickly also check what do we have in
employee register so I think it's a
similar table to employee details that
we used
before we have the same details here so
no not our problem now let's try to
extract the names of the
employees W's name start with vels right
so we will be using the work clause and
like operators
run the command and there you go so we
have three names so if you able to
answer this question they will ask they
might ask a similar question with a
little modification so this time they
might ask you give me the list of names
that will not start with vels so you'll
just replace the like operator with not
like so either they'll ask the questions
which might ask start with vels or they
might ask a question which does not
start with W this is one of the common
questions now going to the second
question so here also they will give it
a Simple Start they will ask to give the
details of the employee who has the
highest salary or they will ask you to
give the highest salary you can simply
use the max aggregation and you can get
the maximum salary so we have
$887,000 and sometimes if you are able
to answer this question they will make
it a little tricky to you and they will
ask give the second highest salary here
you can use offset or there are multiple
possibilities but let me give you the
simplest one where you can have the same
query only difference is where salary is
less than Max of salary first the
subquery will be executed which will
extract the maximum salary and the next
one is less than so it'll give you only
one row which has a little salary which
is Les less than the maximum one right
so simply let's execute the query so we
will have the answer so the next highest
salary is
$78,000 now moving on to the third
question so sometimes they will ask you
to use the update commands as well so
here we have some salary details of our
employees in the employee register
employee going to do here is let's say
this is the appraisal period and they're
giving you 15% hike to all the employees
so you need to update the salary column
so what you do is simply uh update table
name salary plus salary into the
percentage of hike which is 15% so here
we adding that particular percentage in
the form of decimal numbers which is
0.15 and simply run the command and you
have it now you can just simply uh query
the same detail which is Select Staff
from employee details so you will have
the updated salary list here there you
go now let's proceed with the next
question that we have in our list which
is about select the employee name and
salary from a given range right if they
ask you give me only the range of
employees who salary lies between 50,000
to 7,000 so you can use the between
operator here and range of numbers that
is 50,000 and 70,000 just run this
particular code and there you go you
have the details so there are two
employees whose salary lies between
50,000 and 70,000 now the last question
is uh they might ask you to extract the
details from a certain department so
basically this might also turn up to
find a difference between having and
group by CLA sorry having and wear CLA
yeah so this is one of the common
interview questions where they will ask
the difference between having and and
wear Clause so when you are implementing
Group by in your query and you're also
implementing some aggregate functions
like count sum Etc minimum maximum in
those situations when a group by Clause
is involved then you can use having when
there is no uh Group by function then
you can simply go with the we Clause so
here I'm trying to extract the number of
people present in finance department so
I'm not grouping by department so I can
just use where clause and run this and
now in situations where I have to group
by
I mean you know when I have to implement
Group by in those scenarios you can
include having clause in place of where
so that is the fundamental difference
between having and group by and also you
got the understanding of group by
command here and these are the most
commonly asked SQL interview questions
