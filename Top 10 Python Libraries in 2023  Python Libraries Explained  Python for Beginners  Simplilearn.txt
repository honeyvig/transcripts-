now before talking about top python
libraries let's take a look at what a
library is python has produced a number
of Open Source libraries each with its
own root Source a library is a
previously combined set of code scripts
that may be utilized iteratively to save
time now in contrast to languages such
as C plus plus or C python libraries are
not context specific now a library in
this context refers to a collection of
essential components a library is a
collection of modules that can be
installed with the help of a package
manager such as pip now that we know
what libraries are let's take a closer
look at some of the most popular
libraries in Python first on the list we
have numpy numpy is an open source
python Library used for scientific
Computing and data analysis it provides
powerful numerical and mathematical
functions that enable efficient
computation of large multi-dimensional
arrays and matrices numpy is an
essential library for data manipulation
and Analysis in fields such as machine
learning image processing and scientific
Computing now some of the key features
of numpy include multi-dimensional
arrays numpy provides a powerful
n-dimensional array object that can be
used to store and manipulate large data
sets mathematical functions numpy
provides a wide range of mathematical
functions that can be applied to arrays
and matrices as well including linear
algebra Fourier transforms and random
number generation numpy is widely used
library in a data science and machine
learning communities and is often used
in conjunction with other libraries like
pandas scikit-learn and tensorflow
second on the list we have pandas pandas
is an open source data manipulation and
Analysis library for the Python
programming language it provides easy to
use data structures and data analysis
tools for handling and manipulating
structured data panels provides two main
data structures one is series and other
one is data free now a series is a one
dimensional label array that can hold
any data type while the data frame is a
two-dimensional label data structure
with columns and potential of different
data types some of the key features of
Partners include data cleaning Partners
provide tools for cleaning filtering and
transforming data such as filling
missing values removing duplicates and
replacing values data manipulation
pandas provide powerful tools for
manipulating data such as grouping
merging and reshaping data integration
with other libraries pandas integrate
with other popular libraries such as
numpy scipy and scikit-learn to provide
a complete data analysis and machine
learning environment pandas is widely
used in data science and Analysis and
are particularly useful for working with
tabular data such as data in CSV and
Excel files next on the list we have
matplotlib matplotlib is a python
Library used for data visualization it
provides a wide range of tools for
creating graphs plots charts and other
visual representation of data it is a
highly customizable library that allows
you to control every aspect of
visualization you create you can
customize the style color size
appearance of elements such as lines
markers access titles and legends it
also offers several types of plots
including line plots Scatter Plots bar
plots histogram plots pie chart and many
more
matplotlip is built on top of numpy
which makes it easy to work with arrays
and other numerical data matward lib
also integrates well with other python
libraries such as pandas for data
manipulation sci-fi for scientific
Computing and c-bond for statistical
data visualization
fourth on the list we have scikit-learn
scikit-learn also known as sklearn is a
popular open source machine learning
library for python it provides a wide
range of algorithms and tools for
building and evaluating machine learning
models
scikit-learn is built on top of numpy
scipy and matplotlib which makes it easy
to integrate with other scientific
Computing libraries in Python it
