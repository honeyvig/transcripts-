before we get started here is a question
for you in Matlab what is the comment
used to save a command window text to a
file let us know the answer in the
comment section below now just quickly
go through on the agenda for today's
session
today we will start the session by
understanding what is plotting then we
will move on to learn how to create
plotting then we'll learn how to create
multiple plots followed by we will learn
how to add line color and marker style
to a graph then we will learn how to
generate a subplots at last we will
learn some of the 2D plotting functions
in Matlab
now let's begin the session by
understanding what is plotting
plotting is a graphical representation
of a data set that indicates the
relationship between the two or more
variables Matlab plotting plays an
important role in the fields like
mathematics finance and statistics and
data analytics now it's time to learn
how to create plotting in Matlab
creating a plots in Matlab is very easy
if you are creating 2D plots you have to
take a vector a coordinates and a vector
B coordinates and connect them by a
straight line I am taking a variable a
which is equal to
one two three four
and we'll take a one more variable B
which is equal to minus 1
0
1 and 2.
in Matlab to create or to plot any graph
we use a plot function so I am using a
plot function and pass a variable A and
B
as you can see we have got a line graph
where minus 1 corresponds to 1 and 2
corresponds to 4. similarly 0
corresponds to 2 and the 1 is
corresponding to 3. like this you can
get a simple line graph using a plot
function
now what if if the vector a and Vector B
does not contain the same number of
elements can we plot the two vectors
which does not have a similar elements
let us try I am taking one more variable
as C which is equal to 1 2 3 4 and 5. we
have five elements in Vector C
now I'll take one more Vector which is
called D which will be equal to minus 1
0
and 1.
again we will use same plot function to
plot this
plot of C comma d
as you can see we have got an error
because to pull in the plot function the
vector must have the same length then
only we can use the plot function to
plot any graphs in Matlab
using this plot function we can also
plot some trigonometric functions like
sine cos tan secant and cosecant
now let's try one for example first I'll
take a variable a which is equal to some
elements like 1 2 3 4 0 5 minus 1 and 3.
and I'll take a one more variable C
which is equal to sine of E
now again using the plot function
we will plot a and C
as we can see we have got a graph
according to our values that is we have
given some mixed values of integers and
negative numbers according to that we
have got the graph now what if if we use
the standard functions of gravities
using pi 2 pi 3 Pi like that let's try
for example I'll take a is equal to
0 to
pi to represent Pi in Matlab we will use
p and I
divided by 100
from 3 to
3 into pi
and with the semicolon now again I'll
take a variable C which is equal to
sine of a
now we will use plot function to plot a
and
C
as you can see now we have got a perfect
sine wave for our equation that is 0 to
pi divided by 100 to 3 pi
as you can carefully observe the graph
it starts from 0 and increments to pi
divided by 100 and stops when it reads 3
pi in Matlab it automatically increments
by 1. now let's see how to add title
axis labels and annotations to this
graph to add a label to x-axis values a
function called X label
and will pass the name of that label as
X within the single quotes and end with
the semicolon if not you can also leave
it like this one that only and then for
y axis we'll use same y label
and I'll give as a sign of that X
and
close the bracket
and to give the title for that graph we
use a function called title and within
that will pass a title that is a
plot of the
sign
function and close the code and the
bracket
and enter
as you can see in the graph we have x
axis labeled as X and Y axis labeled as
sine X and we have a title for our graph
that is plot of sine function like this
you can create a simple graph using plot
function and add a title X label and Y
label now we'll learn how to create
multiple plots in Matlab now we will
learn how to create multiple plots in
Matlab for that first I'll take a
variable a which will be equal to some
equation that is 0
2 pi
which is divided by 100
2
pi
and end with a semicolon
I'll take a function C which is equal to
sine of
a which holds the results of sine a
then I'll say plot
a comma C
as we did before we are plotting a sine
wave
then I'll say
hold on
hold on function is used to hold the
current plot and edit that plot then
I'll also take new plot and pass the
same variable a
and C
and also I'll pass one more variable
which is equal to R which will represent
the color map of our graph and I am
using a
codes to represent the dotted lines of a
graph one one graph would be a normal
line and another graph will be dotted
line and end with the bracket
now I'll use Legend function
and I'll pass
sine
and
cos
Legend function takes the argument
indicating the plot lines in their name
now I'll just press enter
as we can see we have two waves that is
a dotted one red wave as you can it is
called a COS wave and the normal blue
line is a sine wave the two waves here
has been overlapped because we are doing
it for the same equation
now we will do same for the different
equations for example now I am taking a
variable B and assign a equation 0 to pi
divided by 100 from 3 pi and then I'll
say
C is equal to
sine of that b
and I'll plot
B and
C
then I'll say hold on
and I'll give one more
equation which is equal to a and I'll
change this equation by 2 pi
now now I'll say C is equal to
COS of that
new equation that is a into semicolon
then I'll say
plot
r a
comma C comma d r that is the color
and
I'll say legend of
sine
and cos
and X
label
as
X
and I'll say y label
as
sine of x
and COS of
X
I'll just say sine X
and
cos x
and for title I'm giving
plot of
sine and
cos function
and just will say enter
and as you can see we have our exercises
and y axis our title and we have our
Legend where it says this first graph is
a sine and a dotted line is a COS
like this you can plot a multiple graph
in a single plot in a single graph now
let's learn how to add lime color and
marker style to the graph now let's
learn how to add line color and marker
style let me just clear my screen
and clear all the variables
a style option in plot command are the
characteristic string that consists of
one or more characters that specifies
the color and the line Style
to make it more clear I'll take an
example of a vector which consists of
elements from 1 to 5.
and I'll take a vector B which is equal
to sum of the elements like 0.5
10.5
40
.0
36 point
one
and at last I'll take it as
5 point
close the bracket make sure if then we
are via Vector a consists of one two
five elements then the vector B also
consists of five elements it is one two
three four and five
we have five elements and then
I'll just say plot
i a
B
and now I'll specify the marker size the
markers I should be oval and the color
should be K K represent the black color
and I want the graphed line should be
dotted
so I'm using this codes and this enter
as we can see we have got a graph with a
marker Style
old and a dotted line and a color black
like this you can customize your graph
with any using any of the marker style
color and the line
in the Matlab now it's time to learn how
to generate subplots
the subplot function is to display the
multiple plots in a different sub
regions on the same window
the subplot functions required three
Arguments for example if we take that
three arguments is M and P M cross n
will be the Matrix and P will be the
parts of window
now let's understand it with an example
before that I'll just clear this screen
first we have to create a vector for
that I will take a variable X which is
equal to some equation that is 0 to Pi
divided by
Phi 2
3 pi
3 into
5 this is my equation I am taking
then we have to create a set of matrices
using the cylinder function
for that I'll take a variable as a b and
c I'm taking a three different variable
which is equal to
I am using the function called cylinder
within that I am passing a function that
is 5 into
COS of
RX
and end with the semicolon
now this cylinder function will Returns
the coordinates of the cylinder unit
I have to just press enter
now we will enter the subplots uh using
the keyword we'll use sub
plot
of we have to as we discussed we have to
pass a three
parameters that is I'll give it as 2 2
and
1
and I will name that
as a mesh of
e
and I'll give it as a title which title
will be
ah just forgot to
do this and then
once a block subplot is created likewise
we will do the same
as replacing the values as I'll do it as
position two and it will be for
B and the title will be
B again same thing and now the position
will be
3
and it will be for uh C
and the variable title name will be also
C
now at last I'll take one more position
it will be 4 and the mesh
will be for all three together like is
one
like I'll give all the variables that is
a b and c
all together and the title will be like
same that is
it will be a comma
B comma C
now we will just
a small mistake I'll just delete this
and enter
foreign
plots plotted in the same window window
it is equal to subplot a subplot B
Supply C and subplot ABC together like
this you can create subplots and you can
create multiple plots in a single window
it's time to understand some of the 2D
plotting functions in Matlab we have
numerous difference categories into the
plotting functions like line plots data
distribution plots discrete plots
geographical plots polar plots and we
have numerous subcategories in each
categories like line plots contains line
plots log plots and functional plots in
data distribution plots we have
histogram pie charts Etc in District
data plots we have bar graphs Scatter
Plots Etc in geographical plots we have
visualization of data and map in polar
plots we have polar in polar coordinates
the first category is land pots inline
plots we have three different categories
that is land plots locked plots and
function plots let's see have an example
for line plots first I'll take a
variable a and I'll give a line space
of within the line space I am taking an
0 is X1 potential and 2 pi
as is X2 potential
and
red is the number of points
and I'll just close it by the semicolon
and I am take a variable Y and I'll just
say it as sign off X which Returns the
results of sine X
and as we know we'll for simple line
plot we will use a plot function and we
will plot X and Y by passing the
variables and enter
as you can see we have got this simple
sine graph for a equation
like this you can plot any type of lime
plots using a plot function well coming
back to lock plot I'll take a one more
variable which is equal to X and we have
to pass a value for that variable using
a log space
within the bracket I have to pass the
values I will take it as value a as
minus 1 and
value b as 2 and the semicolon then I'll
just take a one more variable which is
equal to y y is equal to
2 to the power of x
here just have to mention dot I just
made a mistake now I'll use a function
called log log
of X comma Y and also else I want the
grid of My Graph to be on and also I'll
say grid on
as you can see we have got our log plot
which is for the equation Y is equal to
the power of E X and our grid of our
graph is also on
like this you can also plot the log
plot num coming back to function we have
to use a float function for that I am
using the F plot
at the rate of within the bracket at the
rate of one more bracket X
sine of
X
as you can see we have got a function
plot for sine X now I will try the same
function plot for two different equation
that is sine X and cos x for that I'll
just take a variable x t
which is equal to of function plot
of a t into
I'm just passing the equation of cos 3T
this is
this is the equation for x t
s likewise we'll just give it an another
equation which is of Y of t
and it will be of sine
2T Now using F plot
you will plot x t versus
y t
you can see we have two graph that is a
COS 3T and sine 2T has been overlapped
using and we have done this using a
function called a plot which represent
the function plot coming back to our
second category we have data
distribution points in database
distribution points we have histograms
pie charts Etc let's see how to
implement them in Matlab first I'll just
clear my screen and the workspace
to create an histogram I'll take in
variable X which is equal to a random
integers
from
1000
comma 1.
and I'll take a variable H which is
equal to histogram to plot histogram I
am using a keyword called histogram
of the variable which has been created
and enter
we can also customize the width of the
histogram using the function
been waited for example I'll take what
that variable Edge and I'll pass
as say histogram of the same variable X
and I'll specify
the bin
width
this should be within the
quotes
and the width is 5 and just enter
now as you can see in our graph
now as you can see we have created a
histogram plot where the bin it is Phi
that is 0 to 5 that this is 0 to
minus 5 to 0.
now we will move on to one more example
of this category that is pie chart
in pi we can create a pie chart using a
keyword called Pi for that I'll take a
variable again X which is equal to 1
3
0.5
anywhere random variables like three
point
four and nine
I'll just call a function that is
Pi off X
you can see we have a pie chart which is
of 56 percent six percent eighteen
percent three percent and two percent
which is divided based on a value on
given in the variable X
now I'll just use a function called
explode which will
create a gap or differentiate our
pipelot
if it is like the zero
one
zero one
and
zero
this is the value for explored
and again I'll call a function called pi
explode
first we have to pass a variable comma
explode
close with the brackets enter
as you can see we have gave some space
between the graph and separated some
pipe plots in the given plot we can do
this giving an export function and
passing a while for that
now we can also label our pie chart by
using a keyword or a function called
label
and a third category is discrete data
points in discreta points we has graphs
like bar graphs Scatter Plots
Etc let us take one example of bar graph
like let me clear the screen
I am taking a variable X which is equal
to some
values like 1
9 0 0 2 10
to 2000
and I am taking a variable Y which is
equal to some
values like 75
[Music]
91
105 sum of the floating points
also 131
[Music]
150 179
[Music]
do not three 249
[Music]
185.5
[Music]
now to plot a bar graph I'll just
take a function
and pass the variable X comma y
as we discussed before the length of the
two variable must be same I'll add
one more to this list that is comma 2
6.
make sure the variable at the vector X
and the vector y or the variable X and
the variable y must contain the same
number of elements the length must be C
now I'll call a function that is bar X
comma y
you can see the bar graph has been
created here based on the timeline from
1990 to 90 100 to 2000
now what we'll do we'll group this bar
graph and display them in a group
for that I'll take a one more variable Y
which is equal to 2 comma
like two space two space three
and one more Group which is 2 Phi and
six
one more group of two eight and nine
and one more group of 2 11 and 12.
handles pass
this Y into bar
now you can see we have four different
group of variables which is equal to
zero to two zero to two in between two
and four which is equal to 3 same as 2 5
6 2 8 9 and 2 11 12. like this you can
also create a different group of bars
and display them in a single graph
coming back to our next category which
is a polar plots plotting a polar
coordinates
for the tab I'll take a variable called
Theta which is equal to a coordinates
that is 0 to 0
.0122
into pi
and with the semicolon then I'll take
one more variable
and I'll give a equation that is sine of
2 Theta
into
cos 2 Theta
and with the semicolon and Inter now
I'll just use a keyword called
polar plot of
Theta
into
uh yeah I just made a mistake in the
polar
see like this we can we have got this
polar plot for the equation of sine 2
Theta into cos 2 Theta this is the
format of a polar graph it will be in
the form of fla as you can see it looks
like a Petals of flower and this entire
graph is in the form of LA
the last category is animation
to display an animation line we use a
loop to add a thousand points of line
after adding each new Point use a
drawdown to display the new point on the
screen
now let's create this displayed animated
line in Matlab
for the time taking a variable H which
is equal to
animated line which is a function
then we'll take axis c z of
0 to 4
pi
and minus 1 2 1.
close the square bracket and column in
it
oh I just forgot to mention I here
pi
and enter
okay now I have to use uh where two
variables for that I'll take first
variable as X which is equal to a I'll
create a line space
line space of 0
4 into pi
and 1000 which is the number of
points that we have to create and and
with the semicolon and one more variable
is equal to Y is equal to sine of X and
with the semicolon enter
now within a for Loop that is 4
K is equal to
1 starting from 1 to
length of a x
now we have to add points within that we
are having adding points
to her H comma X of
key
and Y of
key
now we will use a function called
draw now
and
end the for Loop
now just brush up all the plotting
function that we have learned in this
tutorial by running some examples on the
plotting graph
first I'll take an a variable X which is
equal to a line space
inside that I am passing a value that is
0
2 pi
and the number of points as 100
and I'll
press enter now take a variable that is
uh I'll just say it as
sign off
X just we are plotting a simple
sign
plot
now
using figure
function is also used to create a one
more figure block when you are you
dealing with the multiple plots or
multiple figure block you can create a
new figure block and then generate your
graph now I'll say
plot
X comma y
as you can see we have just plotted a
simple sine wave as we did before for an
equation passing in the X variable
you can also enable this give title and
also you can on the grid and we can also
set the access level for example you can
give grid on
and
access
level as equal
you can see we have a grid is on the
axis is equal 0 5 1 1.52011.52
this axis is equal like this you can
customize your graph based on the color
the line size marker size marker style
and everything
you can also save your plot as an image
using the function as safe as function
like for example I'll just say
save as
G
c f
sine wave
it will be the name which which it will
be form and the format is PNG
and close the bracket enter
I have to give it a sorry made a mistake
in save as
you can see in the file section assign
web.png has been saved like this you can
save any graph that you have plotted in
your file section and then download it
if you want or import it and use it
whenever you need it
here we have used a function called GCF
which stands for a get current picture
and used to retrieve and handle the
current figure
and also it pass an input argument to a
save as function with this we have
reached the end of this session today we
have learned what is plotting how to
create plotting in Matlab how to create
subplots and some of the 2D plotting
functions in Matlab
