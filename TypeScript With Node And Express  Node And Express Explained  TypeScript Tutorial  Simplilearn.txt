hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn this is anubhav
and in this video we will be learning
about ice script with node and express
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and
press the bell icon so you'll never miss
any update from simply learn
so without further ado
let's see what's in it for you
first
we'll see what is typescript after that
we'll see what is node.js moving ahead
we'll see what is express.js
then we'll see how to setup the
typescript node in express
what is typescript typescript is an
object oriented programming language it
is a strongly typed superset of
javascript and all the code of type
script is compiled with javascript only
it is developed and maintained by
microsoft
typescript was created to develop
large applications
it is mainly used to simplify the
javascript code so that it can be read
and debug easily
what is nodej
nodejs is an open source cross platform
javascript runtime environment
and it runs on a web application outside
the client browser
node.js is used by the developers to
build server side web application
nodejs is perfect for data intensive
applications since it uses an
asynchronous event driven model
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross-platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
xyz is unopinionated
it is high performance fast lightweight
framework of node.js
expressjs makes the node.js code easy as
it is used as a server-side scripting
language
now we'll see how to set up node with
express and typescript open your visual
studio code
your folder which i have created in this
c drive type script
it's an empty folder
i'll show you
open the terminal
i'll show you if it is empty ls
so the folder is empty
now
we'll make a project inside it
we'll simply write npm
in it
hyphen y
for all the default values
press enter
so
you have seen
the package.json file has been installed
in this package
let's clear it
now the first thing you need to install
is typescript
type npm
pn
2d
this will install the typescript
dependencies
now i will install two more dependencies
please write npm
i
test
fn node
i will also install nodemon
this will install all the dependencies
there will be need in this project
let's clear the screen
now now we have to install express
npm
install
express
let's wait for a couple of seconds
the npm express has been created
open the
package.json file here you see
all the dev dependencies
express
nodemon and ts node
has been successfully installed
now we need to create a project inside
this folder for that
we need to write npx
headphone in it
wait for a couple of seconds here we go
here the screen
now we'll execute npx
psc typhoon
in it
so it
has already been here
you can see
yeah
now we will be creating a source folder
for that
write mkdir
rc
enter
this would be containing all our
typescript files here
you can see it's empty
let's create a file here
everything we're going to write is
inside this file only
so
you set up for typescript where the
express in node is ready
you can write anything here
so
with this we have read the end of this
