hi everyone myself dr. society today
named s conquer so the next topic from
the anatomy that is going to be
discussed is a celebrity and so
physiology of saliva and the anatomy of
salivary glands are equally important
they can be as in any of the basics
paper so let's discuss so for the essay
question it's always important to write
the contents so these are the contents
which you need to write for the anatomy
of the salivary glands so do write this
condense okay all these contents is
better if you write then you can give a
simple introduction of how the salivary
glands and saliva plays a very important
role in maintaining the oral as well as
a systemic health and any other
introduction if you want to put in you
can put in there so how the saliva aids
and speech and dilatation and digestion
and antimicrobial effect in lubrication
and em anything whatever you feel you
can put in there okay so and again you
can write as their three major salivary
glands simple introduction you can give
so next you can jump for the development
of the saliva glands so this is a
particular development of how you have
to mention so when mainly the
intrauterine life of the where this when
the salivary glands of that particular
cerebral gland is being developed that
you have to write first so as and you
can see the sixth week is a parotid in
submandibular the seven to eight week of
intrauterine black gland all intelligent
life is the sublingual whereas a third
month of internal trend life is a minus
or every gland so within the first
trimester of pregnancy
almost all the survival glands are being
formed okay and the development actually
occurs in this six stages okay so you
can just name the stages and if possible
you can draw a diagram related to this
stages okay
so mainly you have to write these six
stages like the bird says about
invagination the pseudo glandular the
canaliculi are terminal but stage n of
innovation so if you can write African
name and if you can draw a diagram
related to that then that will be
helpful so coming to the major
classification so classification of the
cell
Deon's is very very important so based
on the main the main the criteria that
is major and minor and again based on
the secretory system you have to
classify so coming to the major salivary
glands we know the three salivary glands
is parotid submandibular and sublingual
whereas a minor salivary glands again
include a label the buccal glands the
Palatine glands and the lingual glands
in the glass of Palatine yawn so all
these are the major under - and every
lands are based on the secretory system
with what all come under Sierra's what
come under Meg's and what come under
mucus so the parotid gland in the Warren
and blur glands are completely serious
but a submandibular gland is
predominantly surreal it's it's mixed
but it is predominantly serious and
sublingual it is predominantly mucus and
the mucous completely mucus are the -
arrived arrogance except the worn em
down so you have to write this
classification for sure and now we have
to individually describe the respective
salivary glands so first major salivary
gland that you need to describe and give
a good description is a parotid gland so
you can give its dimensions you can give
the average weight of it and also you
can give it as it has five processes
that is free superficial and too deep
okay so the main the headings have to
fall in the development followed by the
classification followed by the parotid
gland literal description and again
coming to its details at the boundaries
of the parotid gland so inferiorly what
are the boundaries so clearly what are
the boundaries all that so inferiorly
you can see it is the anterior aspect of
the sternocleidomastoid okay and
superiorly it is the inferior margin of
the zygomatic arch posteriorly the
border of the mandible post-award of the
manual external auditory canal and again
anteriorly it is a superficial aspect of
the posterior aspect of the masseter so
these are the various boundaries that
you need to rise if you can draw a
diagram with this with like over showing
the ER and the mandible and the parotid
gland that will be really fetching so
diagrams are always fetching students so
that will attract the examiner so
wherever you can put a diagram if you
can draw a diagram it's better you draw
ok next coming to the parotid fascia so
the parotid has its own fascia which is
called as capsule okay
and it is continuous the superficial
layer of the deep cervical fascia okay
so it has this fascia again has
superficial and the deep layers the
superficial layer extends from the
masseter and so nuclear dome asteroid to
the zygoma whereas deep layer extends to
the extends from the ratio of the
positive value of digastric we're in it
again it forms the silo mandibular sorry
style of annular ligament which
separates the parotid and the
submandibular glands so this is very
important if you right it will be really
scouring okay and again the attachments
of the fascia includes the parotid sorry
of the parotid fascia enclosed
anteriorly it's a mandible inferior
latest I'll omen deborah lippmann and
posterior you styloid process so if you
can write related to fascia it's very
like fetching okay so next coming to the
duct so every cell every gland has its
own duct so if you can mention that
again the duct and it's important
characteristics that will be again
useful so Stenson's ducts is further
parotid gland so the the cause of the
duct also if you write it's useful so
for example this arises from the
anterior border of the parotid and
paddle and parallel to the zygomatic
arch it runs away and then 1.5
centimeters left it's approximately one
finger breadth inferior to the inferior
margin of the arch okay it runs parallel
like that and since endocrine
superficial to the masseter muscle and
again turns medially 90 degrees to
pierce a box inator and at the level of
maxillary molar and again at the level
you know where the sense in that is seen
and hourly that you can mention okay
this is how you have to write about the
sense on top then you can write the
nerve supply offered so the
preganglionic
parasympathetic from the c---nine nerves
arise in the otic ganglion wireless cell
petrosal nerve and postganglionic fibers
leaves this otic ganglion and
distributes a parotid gland via or
o'clock temporal now this nerve supply
is very very important students okay and
sympathetic is from the post embryonic
fibers ganglionic fibrous from the
superior cervical ganglion and
distributes to the arteriole
system along the arterial system so
mainly the parasympathetic innervation
is very important again this
individually they asked it as a very
short answer
so do remember this so the otic ganglion
the lesser petrosal nerve again the
postganglionic fibers leave the ganglion
and supply the gland wire or a Clos
temporal now so you have to write this
for sure so again the facial nerve we
know it you know it actually enters a
pirated line into no weights it and
after exiting it gives out its file
terminal branches so that if you can
write it's very good so upon exiting at
the style of mastoid foramen it gives
these branches and after it exit the
foramen and this enters into the goose
foot like you know it's the goose foot
of it looks like a ghost foot and
approximately one centimeter from the
silo master program and it gives out its
two divisions and the cervical facial is
followed by its fight terminal branches
we just you can briefly mention of how
the fashion of inner weights and again
leaves out the parotid gland and gives
its five branches you can just mention
that's enough so coming to the other
nerves that is a greater Oracle and
nerve it's deep to the superficial
around the posterior border of the
sternocleidomastoid posture to the
external jugular vein and the parotid
fascia is innovated by the sensory
fibers of this greater or a glut now
okay so it is enough that is first
encountered in the surgery next or
gluten purana we have already discuss
the parasympathetic fibers from the
orange or the ganglion okay and the
sensory fibers us from the trigeminal
know so this is how we have to write you
have to give the nerve supply so
especially then our supply of the
parotid gland is again asked so you have
to write students you have to mention
all the nerves or low temporal now the
trigeminal nerve the facial nerve all
these nerves you have to mention and if
possible put a beautiful diagram okay
and the blood supplies by the retro
mandibular vein and external carotid
artery okay so the lymphatic drainage is
again to the superficial and the deep
cervical nodes
okay so that's it so for every gland you
have to write with a little bit of its
introduction okay of how this or how
does it look if it has a phase share
like for example pirate it has a parrot
aphasia okay and then you have to give
its boundaries and its attachments and
apart from that you have to give its
nerve supply its blood supply and it's
lymphatic drainage okay and the duct
related to that particular salivary
gland so this how this is how the entire
glove an odd part of that particular
structure will be covered okay so next
coming to the submandibular gland so
this gland is again we know it is lies
in the submandibular triangle which is
formed by the anterior and posterior
bellies of the digastric muscle and the
inferior margin of the mandible so it is
a c-shape but it forms a C shape around
the anterior margin of the mylohyoid
muscle where it divides into devices a
mandibular gland into the superficial
and the deep nodes or the deep loops
okay the marginal mandibular branch of
the seventh cranial nerve trans
officially to the submandibular gland
and then deep into the plasma so this is
the mild introduction that you can give
simple introduction for the
submandibular gland if possible you can
put this diagram okay so next coming to
the gland relation so every gland you
have to write its relations and its
boundaries so superficially it is it to
the skin the plat is mom with the
capsule and the cervical branch of the
facial nerve and the facial beam and
deep relations are against the Milo
Hartford for most of the part and
posterior to the lingual nerve and the
hypoglossal nerve so these relations you
need to put in and the wharton start
it's not Wharton's it is what ends duct
we we had wh o RP ons the spelling
mistake so it's a Wharton's duct which
arises from the deep part of the line
and runs from the open side on the
lingual frenulum
reading world freedom so this where it
opens you have to write and the lingual
nerve actually loops around sister so
these two points is very important and
the blood supplies the facial artery and
the facial beam
so the nerve supply is the preganglionic
fibers from the superior server saliva
to the nucleus through the sensory route
that is called a dimple in the facial
nerve Riza submandibular gland on and
from where the posts in ganglionic
fibers actually innovate this
submandibular and this a lingual log
line through the lingual nerve okay so
it reached wire it reads the post
ganglionic recess of mandibular ganglion
through chorda tympani and again it
innervates the submandibular and
sublingual via lingual nerve so this
points we have to put in next coming to
the sublingual gland it is the smallest
of all okay it weighs about 2 to 3 grams
and it doesn't have any true facial
capsule it lies between the floor of the
mouth and mylohyoid its duct is called
as a bottle instruct okay which opens
whitney node adjacent here to the
wharton slab the water is out is the
submandibular gland duct okay and in
most of the cases it has again consists
of smaller ducts of linear Raveena's
this points you can put in for
sublingual gland so the nerve supply is
similar to that of submandibular gland
and blood supply is from the lingual and
the sub mental arteries and veins and
lymphatic drainage is to the
submandibular lymph nodes simple so
every gland has to have its nerve
innervation its blood supply and it's
emphatic drainage its relations and it's
stuck duct so these three major salivary
glands you have to write all these the
boundaries the duct associated the
attachments okay and if it has a fascia
the attachments of the fascia as well
and then the nerve supply the blood
supply and the lymphatic drainage so
these are very important for all these
three major saliva glands so coming to
the minor so the minor are present on
the label and the buccal glands or the
gas law so palatine glands and the
palatine glands on the lingual glands so
the anterior group are called as a
glance of Blandon and none okay which
are near the apex of the tongue and a
mucus character whereas the posterior
are present posterolateral to the circum
violet papillae okay
this is this a simple introduction is
enough so even if an atomic fat is being
asked then you have to write all what
all we have discussed so far and then
little or physiology you can add ok
already we are being discussing the
saliva in health and disease the
physiology part also so you can put some
points from there and you can just add
okay so physiology you have to give this
like serious secretions and the mucus
secretions what are the importance of
that ok and then what is a contribution
of the glands towards the secretion so
this is very important ok
this is very important of how what is
exact contribution of the stimulated and
unstimulated saliva towards the salivary
secretion so if you put this it will be
really fetching okay and you can
highlight that as well and then how the
saliva is being produced what's the
primary and the secondary or the
DuckTales equation so the primary is
through this transport that is a sodium
potassium chlorine for transport and the
it occurs and which actually contributes
to the primary fluid or the plasma of
the saliva sorry the primary fluid of
the saliva okay then ductal secretion is
actually it adds to the ionic
composition of the saliva okay so that
could be other like bicarbonates
potassium and all that which adds to the
ionic composition so just minimum
production of the saliva if you right
it's enough so here are the other
functions as you know the antibacterial
is the lubricating the digestive
functions and how it moistens oral
mucosa okay all that the buffering
capacity and also the prevention of
caries so it is actually it acts as a
protective pellicle over the tooth over
the teeth so it is called as a
protective pellicle and the amino
logical factors like it has AG a apart
from IgA also it has other
immunoglobulins like IgG and IgM to
minor quantity does have that so these
are all the important functions of the
saliva that you need to note it down
okay and then the clinical aspects you
can end in so you can just write the
headings and if required you can write
any important points related to that
luxurious tomia Solorio
salad night is is inflammation of the
salivary glands okay silo's is a non
inflammatory non neoplastic enlargement
of the salivary glands sigh lowly thesis
is nothing but it's related to the ducts
inflammation and the occlusion of the
ducts okay and the benign and malignant
tumors if you can remember from your
undergraduation any points and you can
right there okay
so every question has to end up with the
clinical aspects because that will add
on to your mark so little at least one
page on clinical aspects it's very
important okay so that's it and you can
give these references it's up to you
actually basics paper it's not that
important to give any article references
but you can add some differences it's
okay so this is how you have to answer
for the salivary glands so mainly you
have to write the and add part after
which you have to follow followed by
which you can write the physiology part
simple physiology aspect is enough if a
not a question is asked if your
physiology question is asked then simple
introduction of anatomy is enough so
it's dependent it's actually depending
on whether they have asking as an essay
question or a short answer so based on
the time and the management or you do
you have to answer accordingly so that's
it thank you students
