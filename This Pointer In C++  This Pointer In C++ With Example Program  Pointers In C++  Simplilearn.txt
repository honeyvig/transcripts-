hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this session we
will learn about this pointer in c plus
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
so in this session we will cover topics
like what is this pointer
then we will have a look at the syntax
of this pointer
then we will understand the working of
this pointer and after that we will
learn
how to access the executing object using
this keyword
and we will also learn about the
features of this pointer
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so first topic is
what is this pointer
in c plus this is a keyword that is used
to represent an object that invokes the
member functions
it automatically points to the object
for which the object is being called
or in other words
this keyword points to the current
instance or object of the class
for example let us suppose we have a
local variable of same name as that of
the data member and we want to assign
the value of a local variable to the
data member but having the same name
would create a problem
so in this type of case we use this
pointer
this keyword tells the compiler that we
are referring to objects data members
now
let's learn about the syntax of this
pointer
the syntax for referring class variable
or instance variable would be this
keyword
then arrow operator with class variable
equal to local variable value
and the syntax for referring to current
object of class
would be this with asterisk sign
or d reference operator sign
now
let's understand
working of this pointer
this keyword represents the address of
current instance of the class
the this pointer acts as an implicit
parameter to all the member functions
now implicit parameters are similar to
normal parameters
the only difference is these parameters
are passed silently to the functions
that is
it is passed as a hidden argument and is
automatically passed to the member
function when it is called
now let's learn how to access the
executing object
as we can see in the example we have
created an object obj of class o
and with the help of this object we have
called this function display in which we
are printing the address of the object
and we are also printing this pointer
and this is the executing object
so by printing this
we will get the address of object in the
memory
along with this we can also access the
data members using this keyword
all right now
let's move to features of this pointer
the first feature would be to
distinguish the data members from local
variables which means it helps in making
the class members more readable by
differentiating the members of the class
and the parameters which have the same
name
this keyword helps in differentiating
between the class variable and the
parameters
as we can see in the example we are
assigning the var variable
which is a parameter
to the class member where
and this can only be done with the help
of this pointer
now
let's move to the next feature
that is
method chaining in c plus plus
method chaining in c plus plus is a very
useful feature of this pointer
it helps to chain methods together for
ease and cleaner code
in this each method returns an object
and allows the call to be changed
together into a single statement
it helps in invoking multiple methods
that are chained together as we can see
in the example set method replace method
and inc method are chained together in a
single statement
and arguments are also passed

so now let's go ahead and do some
examples of this pointer in our code
editor that is vs code
all right so here we will do an example
of this pointer in which we will show
that how this pointer differentiates
between the class member and the
parameters having the same name
so let's go ahead and first of all let's
create a new file
and let's name it
this
one dot cpp
all right now we can write the
header files
hash include iostream
now we'll write the namespace standard
now we will start with the main function
we'll write int main
inside in main first of all we will
write the class name and then the object
of that class let's say object
now
let's write return 0 first of all
and now we can make some calls with this
object but before that
let's create class
so all right now we have to create a
class
which has the name a
as we know the class name is a we have
already defined and the name of the
object is obj so let's create class
a
and inside that class we will
inside the private scope
we will declare some variables
let's say
and x
y
and z
so these three are the variables now
i'm sorry
spelling is wrong and
z
so these three are the variables
now inside the public scope
we will create a function
let's say the name of the function is
set
so data type is void name of the
function is set and
from the main function we will call this
set function
so all we need to do is we'll write the
name of the object
obj dot operator
set which is the name of the function
and we will pass
the arguments let's say uh 20
54 and 65
these are random numbers
now
here we will write
int x
and y
intersect
as you can see the
parameters and the class members
have the same name
so variables
are of same name
so for that we know that we have to
write this
pointer
so
we will write
this
x
so here
this x is the parameter 1 and this x is
the class variable
so this pointer differentiates between
both of them
as the name is same so this will help in
differentiating
we'll do the same for y
and we'll do same for x this
arrow operator
z equals to z
so here we are assigning the values to
these class members
now after that we will display these
values so let's create another function
let's say the name of the function is
void print
all right so inside this function will
simply display these variables
so we'll write
x value is
the small one x
x value
is
the variable x and after that we will
write n l
write
y value is
y
handle
we'll do same for z you can copy it
and just paste it
it will save some time
all right as we have displayed or
printed all of these three variables
so
as the class ends so we need to
add the semicolon in the end
now
this print function we need to call this
one
so with
obj
object
we will call this print function
all right
so
after calling this we have already added
return 0 so let's save this one and try
to run it
all right let's check
here it is
x value is 20
y value is 54 and that value is 65
so arrow operator helped us in
differentiating between the class
members and the parameters
what if we don't use this
let's
have a look at that as well
if we do not use
this
pointer
then
let's save it and let's try to run this
let's check the output
as you can see x value is zero y value
zero z value zero it is not correct so
this one is right and this is our output
correct output
now
let's do another example
so here we will do an example and see
that the
this pointer can be used for calling the
member function as well
so we'll do an example regarding that
so first of all let's name this
this two dot cpp
let's save it
and we'll start with hash include
iostream
now the name space standard
will start with int main
inside int main we will
name the class
and create the object obj
class name is king and the object name
is obj
so from here we will call a function
let's say obj
dot
let's say the name of the function is
text
here we are calling
and let's say return 0 after this
now we have to create this class
so let's create this class
class king
and inside this class king
inside the public scope
we will declare the functions
first of all we'll declare function
call
and
now
we will define a function
that is text
so inside this text function
all we need to do
is to print a message
and call another function
so first of all we will print a text or
a message let's say
hello brother
so after that
we'll write endl
now we will call another
not c out we will call this function
call which we have declared and not
defined yet
so we will write this
arrow operator
c a l
call this is how you can call using this
pointer
and
here we are calling this call function
so
we'll close the class using semicolon
and now
inside the class scope let's say
void king scope resolution operator
this means that
this function is
of class king
so
now we will
print whatsoever we want let's say
k is
display a text
let's say
a
and that's it
then we'll do the same for
b and c
here we will print b
and now we will print c
all right now all we need to do
and everything is done yeah because we
have created this function outside so
we don't have to use this semicolon now
we can save this
and we can try to run this
here we can see uh hello brother and abc
so this is what we want to print here we
can see we have used this
pointer to call this call function
and
after printing this hello brother
a b and c is getting printed so this
means this is the correct output
now let's do another example
let's make a new file and save this one
let's name it this three dot cpp
all right so here now we will do an
example of method chaining as we know we
use method chaining when we
want to return the reference of the
object
and method chaining helps us in writing
a clean code as it chains up the calling
together into a single statement so
let's start
first of all we'll include the header
file
cache include iostream
now
write the namespace standard
now we'll write the main function
by mistake we have
all right
now inside the main function first of
all we write the name of the class that
is test
and we'll create the object
the name of the object would be n1
now
we will chain up the calls
let's say the name of the object n1
and the name of the function let's say
is assign
and we are passing 100
and now we'll chain up display function
with it
so this is method chaining
now
we'll write it on 0
and now we'll start with the
class
so
class name is test
and inside the class we'll declare a
variable let's say
num
and
now under public scope
we will
write the function
and
will not define the function in a usual
way we'll write the data type first of
all let's say
test
is the data type
address of operator
assign which is the name of the function
and
argument would be num the parameter
would be num
and inside this function
will use this
arrow operator
and now
we will assign
the value of
parameter num
to the class variable
after that we can return reference to
the object we'll use the dereference
operator
and
this pointer
now
we will make another function that is
display
and inside this display function
will print a message
and we will print the
variable that is done
so first of all we'll print the message
saying that
the value
of num
is
all right after the class we'll put a
semicolon
and we'll try to run this one
after saving it
so as we can see
the value of num is 100
so let's do some modifications in that
let's say
we want to add 1000
so it will get added but we need to save
it first now we'll try to run
as you can see the value of num is now
1100
so these are chain function calls and
when the reference is returned this
reference
is returned then this reference can be
used to change the function calls from a
single object that is
n1 in this case
so
this is the data type and this is the
address of operator when we are doing
the method chain we must do it like this
and then we will return the reference to
the object
so these were some examples of this
pointer in c plus plus you can try some
more examples if you want to learn this
topic in a much better way
all right guys with that we have come to
