despite the decay of work experience in
the industry I felt I haven't achieved
the success I aimed to I felt my skills
did not match Market requirements and it
was going out of sync with the evolving
Market standards that's when I realized
I needed to make myself Market ready and
adapt without wasting any more time I
decided to up skill and I enroll for
professional scrum Master certification
offered by simply learn this decision
proved to be the turning point in my
career as I was able to secure a new job
Road from being a senior process
associate to now as a Project Lead hi my
name is priad dashni manand and this is
my journey I started in one of a very uh
leading it concerns in Chennai but I did
not get a position which I actually
wanted for at some point I had an hunger
for getting into a project management
role so that Journey wasn't easy and I
felt at some point in time I should
upskill myself otherwise I would be lost
in the crowd earlier when we started
careers in um
20101 it was just uh assumed that only a
btech or an mtech person who would get
into it roles whereas in a given
scenario or in today's case that's not
the thing actually anybody who want
wanted to get into uh technology they
just do a course and they just come in
they explore they learn and they get
into good uh levels and that's how the
market is running at present there were
so many people who are telling about so
many other programs and also other
companies that was offering but I had a
couple of my friends who have done
courses with simply learn they were just
talking about the mentors that they will
be helping you until you finish your
course and all those so in this case I
should actually tell about my husband
because we live in a very nuclear family
it's only me and him he was the one who
supported me throughout this let's say a
weekend uh it was 88 hour of courses I
have to sit the whole day for the course
uh I wouldn't have time to take care of
the household C or something like that
he does on behalf of me so he doesn't
complain that uh you have not done or
something like that so I feel he was the
biggest support I had here and uh and
honestly to say this course was taken
only because of him as well whatever
background you come in from uh the
mentor would be in a position to help
you to get into the desired uh area that
you wanted to go to so the mentorship
was good that was one thing I should say
uh second thing is my project that I've
worked on so that has helped me to carve
our ways to this particular rule from
operations in the same organization to
move into a technology background this
particular course has helped me a lot so
I just published my certification I just
told give me an opportunity this is my
desire I wanted to move further in this
and uh that's how it has made a
difference in my carer bar just because
I was able to move into this position
I'm just uh getting new new work that I
am learning towards my career path I
have to start with a PMP next would be
the PMP course that I wanted to bre it
up uh to move into a full of project
management and then maybe I have to do
an Executive MBA in uh top institutes
like I AMS uh which is a bigger uh goal
for me in life at this present condition
but I feel I should do that I'm not that
great person to give messages but what I
follow is follow your dreams have your
goals set in life dream big whatever it
might be dream big you achieve it or not
when when you just tell it to the
universe when you dream big you will
surely achieve it there might be so many
wealth related things that you learn
from people around but never get worked
up with all those you have your own life
you have your own capability and you
have your own path you have to carve it
and you'll have to move further with
your own desires never compare yourself
with anybody in life you are unique in
this world
