being a finance person it's very
difficult for me to understand the basic
concepts of cyber security I moved back
to India during covid-19 to be with my
family I took up my career in the area
of cyber security and the risk and
compliance Sy at work it was very
challenging for me to understand and do
the continuous learning in the area of
cyber
security I have been in the industry for
more than 15 years of experiences I
started my journey in the area of
internal audit and also slowly moved
into the information security and also
other risk and compliances this helped
me to venture into the new companies and
also with the hike in
salary hi my name is hariharan
pandurangan currently working as the
principal consultant in the weo
Technologies and this is my
journey when I was a kid I was always
wanted to get into the technology
related areas this was not well planned
during the time now I'm started getting
more opportunities working in the
various countries really helped me to
understand their business practices and
also the business equipments their
cultures Etc I used to work in the
internal audit mainly focusing on the
operational controls then slowly I moved
on to the information security and
general controls in cyber security it's
very important to know what threats that
the company is are facing and what what
tools that the hackers are using to
attempt into the company's devices this
helps us to create the compliance
measures and also the Strategic measures
to prevent the attacks on our own
company I was having a chat with my
friends related to our job one of my
friend suggested simply land is the
company that offers the various
Solutions and then I did the research
studies when I inquired with the simply
learn they offer a program called
Advanced Executive Security program
simply learn has been very crucial for
my ongoing Learning Journey this program
helped me to gain knowledge in the areas
of vulnerability management malware
analysis data security privacy and also
on the cloud security areas the initial
phase was really challenging for me I
could not able to spend my time with my
family every week I started attending
the classes sometimes you have to
sacrifice in your life to get benefit
out of them so definitely the live
classes helped me to get benefit and I
could able to get the certifications at
the very early stage so this helped me
to venture into the new companies and
also with the hike in salary my advice
to the professional is do not settle
with the current level of knowledge if
you get the very good role and the
impactful role definitely it will pay
way for your new career opportunities
and also the career growth the
technology is dynamic keep constantly
learning things day-to-day life so it's
not only important to learn things but
you have to put into practice in the
real life unless you put in practice it
will not pay results to what you are all
the things that you have learned so far
keep learning and adapting this is super
important
