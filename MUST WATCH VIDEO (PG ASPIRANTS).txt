yeah hi conquers okay this is Dr
shant uh I just want to give an example
just want to correlate two things that
many of you interns particularly doing
and as well as the repeaters I a
normal aspirant ideology I just want to
correlate this with a frog and a
temperature okay I just want to
correlate this with an example or a
theory of frog
and temperature okay uh this the is very
simple I think many of us are not much
known about this but it's it will be
very fine to see just have a look over
this and um okay that is a
frog if you keep the Frog um in a
boiling water in a
bowl okay if you keep the frog in the
bowl and if you keep on increasing the
temperature the Frog body system is made
in such a way that it adapts to the
surrounding temperature means whenever
the boiling temperature raises the Frog
adapts its body temperature in such a
way that it can balance the surroundings
and it can Sur surv in that abnormal
temperature as it
moves from a normal temperature to 50°
C it adapts 60° it adapts 70 adapts 80
adapts mov on 90 adapts once it reaches
100 100 we know that it's a boiling
point once it reaches 100 okay the BR
the Frog okay the Frog once the
temperature reaches 100 which is
the boiling
temperature okay uh once it reaches the
100 the frog in this bowl it tries to
jump
out okay but the
Frog
cannot cannot
jump
because the reason behind this is like
it
uses all the
energy for
adaptation okay the Frog uses all the
energy that is present in it for the
adaptation or modifying the body
temperature according to the
surroundings and when it feels and when
it it is emergency that it should jump
because after boiling point it can't it
cannot adist the temperature it will
die but once trying to jump the the Frog
does not have the energy that is
required to jump and the Frog
finally
dice okay
this is what happened with the majority
of us okay during the preparation
majority of us will face the same issue
during the preparation of
[Music]
us okay so this is what uh we we face
during the preparation I can just
correlate with the uh with your
preparation very simple easy way of
correlating the stuff with your
preparation
majority of the aspirants particularly
interns I can see this more in
interns fresh
intern then
a a
repeat okay what they do is like they're
similar in a
bowl
of preparation okay that's similar same
as that of frog there in a bowl of
preparation
okay then never try to start the
things as the time is going on time goes
on right so time goes on this aspirant
thinks that okay next week I'm going to
start the things next week next
week I'm going to start the things next
subject I'm going
to start the things
next month I'm going to start the things
and finally it goes
on next year I'm going to start the
things this is happening with many many
many of the
inters in the past and right now
too so I feel bad for these people okay
you people you know what you do as time
is lapping out you think that okay I'm
left over with 5 months okay 5 months
I'm going to cover 20 subjects one more
month is done time is going right one
more month 4
months I'm going to cover 20 subjects
one more month is going 3
months I'm going to cover 20 subjects
and
finally it leads to word called as name
quit next year next
year I'm going to do this
bad this is bad okay when there is
something that you need to jump from the
bow and you need to start the
preparation similar to that of the Frog
if frog when it has good amount of
energy when it feels that the
temperature is exing it can jump out but
frog does not uh the reasons may be many
one is lazy being
lazy being not like active there many
many things but as I just want you guys
to start the Things Early time is going
on as the temperature is going on in the
bow in the case of frog so when you it's
better you jump out right now what
you're going to do in the bow what
you're going to do in your brain
thinking that when I should start okay
next week I want to start next week I
want to start so remove all this okay
start the things try to do the things
fast analyze the things work on work on
the
and try to give your
best okay uh this is one and the second
thing is for the people who are
making 165 or
160
plus okay if you
guys want to increase your score you
need to follow this first basic
funa never
give
exam on phone one second never
give
exam
at all
times first follow these two things it's
not only for the people of this range it
it it works good for people of any sort
of range
generalize things a generalize General
things that everyone should
follow Saturday half
day revision should start okay and
interns or repeaters for
now Sunday half
day you can continue your preparation
and you can give exam
in the Sunday next half okay so this is
a few things that you guys must
follow
okay and one more thing like
spend
complete 3
hours with
paper
okay don't
skip questions
or
options these are a few things to follow
but I just want to give you how to do
this okay uh initially in the initial
say the few people who are making the
exam very fast they're finishing the
exam very fast 1 and half hour
completing 300 mcqs it may not work good
in final exam so my suggestion for you
guys is uh you can do this okay you can
take you can take a sheet of white
paper okay where you
can Mark 1 2 3 4 uh up to 300 I mean
before starting the examination only or
else I feel we'll provide this stuff
okay practicing stuff omr stuff
evaluation forms the many other forms
which are prepared by MDS conquer we are
going to provide you these stuff along
with uh your power play books within
short duration time Max 1 month the
books will be at your hand along with
these forms and all the accessory stuff
that are prepared in a smarter way for
your uh preparation okay so uh you just
you just write this okay uh once you're
done you need to work with both the
hands one with the mouse and
uh your eyes should work and followed by
this paper once you're done with the
first question okay I have
done I have done with the first once
you're done done with the first
question uh so you need to move on you
need to move on to the next one okay
so so you need to move on to the next
one once you're done with the question
you keep a mark like this or you can
keep a tick mark okay this tick mark
gives a hint that you are clearly done
with the first question and you need to
underline or you need to write the
keyword starting letter of the keyword
which is the most common uh bone disase
so common is keyword okay you can write
Common in the right okay so you're clear
with the question and the tick mark
gives an information that you are very
clear with the question option A keep a
DOT option b keep a DOT option C keep a
DOT option d means this gives an
information that you are not missing any
option because many of us even me I used
to miss some option because if you find
a good answer that is there in your
particular McQ books what you're reading
or the discussion you directly go for
such option if it is there can be better
option or a best option than this so
that can happen so a tick mark gives an
information that you are confirmed with
the question followed by the keyword
that is important for the question
followed by dots which gives information
about a b c once you're done you can
keep the uh answer and you can move to
the next question or else once you are
solving the uh elimination based
questions you can just keep it wrong if
you're eliminating D option and a option
and if you're confused about B and C and
you finally confirmed B you can
eliminate and keeping an into Mark in
the same worksheet okay uh we call this
as
worksheet while you give examinations if
you do this definitely there will be an
increase of 10 marks in your final exam
if you start doing this right from now
because analyzing the paper in the final
exam and giving the best of you in the
final exam is more important than what
your reading day by day this is this is
called as a practice okay this is called
as a practice and we will make you to
practice as well as for because this
this is analysis where many of you
students they do well here they study
well they do well but they spoil the
exam and come back so this this is what
happened this is one thing that you need
to follow guys okay uh okay I have an
issue I have an issue in the sense like
I can feel like many of the people still
there going not only people of MDS
conquer my friends who are part and
there many people who are not preparing
or not analyzing the things very well uh
I mean this is a conclusion that is
obtained from talking with more than
thousand people who has given the recent
need examination and out of which many
people are successful I just want to
give uh what's the difference
between exams before 2016 means exams
there many exams before 2016 that is the
most favorite exam is aipg followed by
as followed by PGA okay uh the pattern
of preparation of as is a bit changed
okay the PGI is as same where as APG
there is no pointing of APG now it was
completely neat and we used to have
state
entrances now we don't have that okay so
it's all about
neat then we need to move about ases and
we need to move about PGA okay so I
think you guys are clear with this uh so
there will be a video uh which is going
to be uploaded in one or two days uh
about your methodology change in the
trends or changes Trends or
changes that you need to
do while you're preparing for this meet
or as because as uh ideology of Papa set
is also a bit different if you take the
last two two two papers into
consideration of the Toppers into
consideration so I want you just try to
focus on uh we we'll have a video on
this trend changes this is just to analy
it's not for the promotion purpose it's
just to analy you because I feel like
many of the people still are going in a
wrong direction because of wrong
assumptions okay if you're asking an
individual who has cracked a APG rank
topper and if you're taking suggestions
from that topper it doesn't make any
sense because need is changed you're
going to write NE and you asking some a
Topper who don't know anything about NE
I think he may be good at subject I
agree that he is good at subject because
he's cracked
a I I appreciate them but they have not
written neat and how can you take
suggestions from them and they have not
seen the need Pap as need questions are
not out he can't give an analy
he can't analyze the paper okay if you
want to take information you can take
from the recent need people you can talk
with them people has appeared for the
need or if you appeared for the need you
can analyze the paper by comparing the
previous aapg papers which are with you
but don't take suggestions from the
people who has cleared the entrance long
back they may be Toppers they may be
good at subject really we have to uh
give sort of appreciation for them
because of the success and their
achievements but I feel it it's not a
right way to take a suggestion from such
a people and start your preparation and
it's
true we'll have a video uh within a
short duration of time for now uh I I
just want to say all the best to
conquers particularly and all the best
to the aspirants who follow
us uh yeah thank you and all the best
this is Dr
ston signing off bye
