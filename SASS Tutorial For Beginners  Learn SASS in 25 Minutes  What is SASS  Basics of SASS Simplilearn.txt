foreign
and welcome back to another video by
simply learning this is anubhav and in
this video we will see what is SAS
features and I will be demonstrating its
Concepts and features so let's begin but
before that if you haven't subscribed to
our Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and press the Bell icon
so you will get all the updates from
Simply learn also I wanted to tell you
guys about this amazing program by
simply learn so if you want to become a
software developer consider this Caltech
postgraduate program in full stack web
development by simply learn and master
those necessary skills check out the
link in the description for more details
you can also call on the number that are
given below to know more about this
program so do check it out now let's
jump into our video I'll open the visual
studio code
and then I'll tell you what jazz is
let me create new window okay I'll close
this one
okay
so says or syntaxically awesome style
sheet is a preprocessor scripting
language that is compiled into cascading
style sheet which is CSS it offers more
advanced feature than CSS such as
nesting variables mixins and functions
which makes it easier and more efficient
to write and manage style sheets I'll
demonstrate each and everything I have
told you about these features first
firstly we'll see about what is these
nesting variables and mixins and all
we'll first see about it and then we'll
dive into it okay so SAS is a CSS
preprocessor like suppose you have
written a code in size what the
preprocessor will do is it will process
the SAS code into CSS for example in
react we write jsx then it gets
converted into HTML right so now SAS is
completely compatible with odd versions
of CSS okay it also reduces the
repetition of CSS and therefore it saves
time that means when we write CSS code
okay I'll show you one of my files in
just a second
I'll open this Tailwind okay
in this source and this okay so I have
opened this CSS file for you guys okay
so in this what we are doing is we are
giving some uh commands to this page
that I have created one portfolio app
okay this video will be in the
description don't worry about any of the
things just learn the concepts okay
so here we are giving some command to
app logo then we are just giving it
height and pointer events then we are
again using that app logo to give it
animations okay but with the help of SAS
we can do it in one go we don't have to
declare every time these things we can
do it in the one go
so now I think you have got to know it
saves a lot of time okay
so to get started with jazz you need to
install it in your computers
you can go to SAS
I have open that for you guys let me
include this one yeah
here when you'll go or let me show you
you just write SAS okay the first thing
that will come is this one so as it is
showing CSS with superpowers right so
SAS is a most mature stable and Powerful
professional guide CSX extension
language in the world
these are some of the features or the I
would say the things that are very good
about SAS as SAS compatibility Rich
features that we'll talk later mature
industry approved large community and
Frameworks like bootstrap Bourbon and
Chassis
okay
so we'll click on this install and then
you will find your device like if you
have mac that one is paid you can
install it for free with the help of
this command okay
just copy this command open your virtual
Studio code but first let me create one
folder for you guys
okay I'll create it in the desktop
and let's name it as SAS
okay
I have opened folder
and create new folder
let's meet created here
then we can open that right
now and play this folder here opening
the video Studio code this one going to
the bootstrap okay this one yeah
open this SAS folder yeah and we are
good to go
now we'll open the terminal
okay
so these are some shortcuts that I
wanted to tell you guys because so many
students tell me about how to do these
things so for that I opened the terminal
with control and backtake control and
back tech you can also open it with the
help of this
dominant new dominant okay so it's
showing that
we can do it
with Ctrl shift and back tech but we can
do it with the control and back tip okay
it's open two terminals let's kill one
yeah now what we have copied from there
we'll paste it here so let's wait a
couple of seconds to get an installed as
you can see it's installed for this you
should have node.js installed in your
system and npm installed in your system
to install uh npm you just write
npmi and it will get installed okay if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
now let's move forward now let's install
the compiler for SAS okay for that just
go to the extensions and here right
live
SAS
compiler
and as you can see
this one is preview this extension is
duplicated
okay
let's install this one
this is also a good one I don't know why
this one is deprecated replicate means
it's removed uh okay fine this one is
also
good
okay yeah
now it's installed in my system and I
think you are also installed you have
done the installation now here we'll
create a folder let's name it as SAS
here we will create a file
let's name it as index
dot HTML
okay
and inside this we'll create a file in
this SAS
let's name it as says
let's name it as
okay
custom
Dot
as you can see it is showing this this
now what I'll do is I'll create one
program for you guys or if you want I
can explain you first the features then
we'll move on to the
that recording part right
so once you have installed SAS into your
systems
uh in this file we are going to write
your the styles using CSS syntax the
main person purpose of this video is to
know more about SAS syntax okay which
includes features like variables nesting
mix-ins and functions
so let's take a look at each of these
features in more detail and then I'll
explain you about it okay so the first
one that I told you about is variables
so SAS allows you to Define variables
that can be used throughout your style
sheet that means when you declare a
variable in this one it will be same
throughout the style sheet okay this can
be useful for defining colors font sizes
and other common properties that you may
use to reuse okay
to Define a variable you use the dollar
sign
or dollar symbol followed by the
variable name and its value for example
I have
okay I'll open the SAS file here I have
declared one dollar sign and then I will
write
primary
color
semicolon and then I'll write red
so you can also add some other extent
cool extensions like prettier to make
your code look good or stylish
okay or we can also write it as dollar
sign we'll declare variables like this
only
font size
should be 16 pixel
right this is how we write the code
right okay from with this we can go live
just by clicking on the start so it has
taken us to this one so let's just cut
this one and this one
okay minimize this one
okay now we'll talk about nesting I'll
go deep into it don't worry I'll explain
each and every concepts of these
features but firstly I'll tell you about
the main main things okay so now what is
nesting in SAS SAS allows you to Nest
selectors within one another okay which
can make your style sheet more organized
and easier to read
to Nest a selector simply include it
inside another selector for example I'll
give you one example
let's open the HTML file now and we'll
write
navigation bar
for nav
and inside that I'll use the UL which is
ordered list
unordered list actually
and then we'll give it a margin
of 0
and then we'll give it a bidding
and then we'll give it
list
Style
let's give it none
so inside this nav
we use this order unordered list okay so
this is what this nesting is we are
nesting something else inside a nav okay
so this is how we Nest a selector okay
now we'll talk about make sense
so mixins are reusable blocks of code
that can be included in multiple styles
they are similar to functions in
programming languages okay to create a
mix in you can use the
add mixing directive
we have to create that will show you you
can add add the read or add mixin
directive followed by the name of the
mixin and its properties for example I
will show you
so first we'll write mixin
border
so this is what a directive name okay we
will first will declare mixin add mixing
and then let's write border radius
inside that we have used the dollar sign
and then radius okay
now inside this we'll name the other
properties like okay I'll show you one
or two
web kit
webkit border radius then we'll give it
a radius we can use also use
Mars border radius okay border radius
Tire radius these are the things that we
can use
you can then include the mixing in your
styles using the add include directive
at the rate we will write if you want to
use this link if you have written mixing
in this and I have to do use it not in
this sash file obviously but if I have
to use it inside some other file so I'll
write include in the
upper module of the page and then I'll
write include and then I'll write the
directive name okay
so
you can use it as I'll give you one
example of that here
so have you created one mixing or
something else here
so I'll write
button inside this button I have to give
it a properties of that mixing that I
have already created somewhere else okay
so then I'll write
include
order
radius
so now I think you guys are getting it
that it's making us very making research
very easy and CS is very easy right so
because of this one line we don't have
to write this paragraph not this
paragraph if I'll complete this code
okay I'll just complete this and then
I'll show you
so yeah so we have created one border
box or something then we can include
this border radius here
right
it's that simple right it's making CSS
very easy
I'm telling you guys just stay focused
you will learn CSS SAS it's very simple
okay
now we'll talk about functions in SAS
so functions are similar to mixins only
but they return a value that can be used
in a style
to create a function you can use a add
function directive followed by the name
of the function and its properties that
didn't make sense we used to write at
the rate include directive right in this
functions we'll write at function
directive okay
it's very similar to mixing
so let's write an example here we'll
write function
embed
with all the sign Excel
and then
we'll return
x n divided by
16 or something else and then let's
in 16
or 1.
okay
so you can then use this function in
your code to style your calculator value
for example okay
so now we'll give you an example okay
not not the body tag and you will just
giving you an example
font size should be m
20 pixel that's right
so yeah
to compile your SAS file into a CSL file
you will need to run it through the SAS
compiler right so this can be done using
the command line or by using a task
Runner like Gulp or grunt
okay
and now we'll see
I just close this tab and then this
extension was working completely fine so
I was just telling you about this size
so I just click on this as and it's
compiling now
just wait for a couple of seconds more
so I'll tell you more about SAS SAS was
created by Hampton Carlton in 2006 and
was later it was designed to make CSS
more Dynamic and flexible allowing more
efficient and scalable styling for web
pages
okay so let's now see whether it is
working
go here
just a second
now let's see the compiler okay as I
removed these two semicolons and saved
it it created two files for us okay one
is custom.css and second one is
custom.css.map so what we'll be doing is
here is so Source mapping URL custom
this file okay so whatever we write in
this file it will then convert it into
CSS as I have already told you
now let's move forward let's open the
HTML let's delete this code and here
I'll
write
okay here now let's create a header in
this body
and we'll link it don't worry
so I have created
hello from
simply learn
okay
now here I'll name this document as
what you doing
and then I'll link my this CSS file into
my HTML okay
so I'll write link
so I'll write my style sheet
okay after that I'll give the link of my
this custom.css file okay for that I'll
write the folder name inside this folder
it's custom load CSS right
let's save it
okay the head is giving me and
now everything is same as CSS okay don't
worry about anything guys it's all same
but now we have to write all our CSS
code into this SAS file and then it will
get converted or mapping into this CSS
okay you will see
into some time
will go to the custom.js
now
what I observe and I also do this I'll
use the semicolons here
or
like I'll write here this one
header then we have to do it something
like that I'll also do that but inside
this SAS we don't use these things okay
now
see how simple it is okay
we'll
read first let's give it a width to that
hello world or something
I do
with hundred percent
hide
50 pixel would be
fine
background
as I have told you I will show error
when you will do the wrong CSS you have
word using CSS
and now you will see it just mapped all
our SAS code into this CSS file right as
I have written here header with 100
height 50 pixel background blue and it
just converted all the things into this
without I don't have to write this I
didn't write this as you can see so this
is that simple okay and it has very
great features
right
let's move ahead now we'll see how to
Nest nesting we have to do nesting okay
for that we'll do here give it a
building first
everything
let's be preparing of 10 percent to that
header that we have created just now
this one
okay
I'll give it a fair thing and then
okay we can't use that semicolons here
okay fine so we'll write H1
inside this H1 we'll write
color
and we'll give it a color white
then text a line
sender okay after that I want hover
whenever I hover on that H1 tag which is
Hello from Simply learn it should change
the color Okay so so we'll give it a
background right
that also okay
so let's save it
and let's check whether it is compiled
successfully or not
okay okay now we'll just right click on
this HTML file
and open with live server
and as you can see it's showing
completely fine as I hover on this hello
from Simply learn it's working
completely fine so this is how SAS works
we are writing SAS code here and
it is converting our SAS code into what
SAS
the CSS code into SAS okay so overall
SAS is a powerful tool for writing and
managing style sheets and its use of
variables nesting mixins and functions
can make CSS more efficient and easier
to work with if you are working on a
large or complex web project it may be
worth considering using SAS to help
streamlining your Styles and improving
your workflow
