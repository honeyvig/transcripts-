hi vanessa this is dr sri kant from team
mds conquer
now i'm back here to continue mds
conquer
neet 2020 recall so the subject of
discussion is going to be community
so the question number one a group of
four to eight
experts discussing about oral health to
prevent dental caries
in front of a community what type of
communication
or discussion it is hope you learn this
different types of
discussions that is the panel discussion
the group discussion the symposium
role playing or social or social drama
okay
so before going into the right answer we
learn few important aspects so first of
all we'll learn about what is symposium
symposium is generally what you
regularly encounter in your pg life
okay so once you start your pg they're
going to keep some symposiums
what is actually the symposium symposium
is
is they go they're going to give a
single topic
a topic and a series of students
or the speakers are going to discuss on
the same topic so all the sessions are
going to be like five or six sessions
are
are going to be on the same topic and
and the speakers are going to brief
their point of view
related to the particular topic and
there is no discussion among the
speakers
but at the end at the end the the
consent person
okay the the consent person is going to
come out with the conclusion
and summary okay so in the end the
audience which are which are around them
they can ask few questions related to
this okay
so this is all about symposium
symposiums are regularly done
on a single topic the speakers are going
to discuss
the next thing is the group discussion
and most of you are well familiar with
the group discussion so in this diagram
you can see
most of the people are they they their
position the chair positions are
in circle okay so a group a group is an
aggregation of the people interacting in
face to face situation
and the maximum size of a group should
not be more than well the range
is 6 to 12 so it's an important question
again
okay the process of identifying the
problems
and they have to find a solution
to the problem and the participants in
this they sit
in the circle position you can clearly
appreciate that in the diagram
and there will be a leader for this the
group leader
who is going to initiate the subject or
who is going to describe
what are the concerns or the what are
the solutions what the what are the
questions for which you have to get the
solutions
uh by which and he always encourages uh
uh like encourages everyone to
participate uh in that particular
session and the main disadvantage is
unequal participation few people
who who react react or involve more in
the
more in this group discussion and few
people they will be skipped or they will
be ignored
in the discussion so that's the main
disadvantage of a group discussion but
the concern so the points to be noted is
the effective size the effective size is
going to be
six and it ranges to maximum 12 okay
and i mean like what what is the leader
is going to do okay the functions of the
leader
is going to initiate the subject or
prevent the side conversations among
the among the group mates and always
encourages each and every one to be a
part of this
the main disadvantage you have to make a
note about the disadvantage they can ask
the disadvantage related to the group
discussion
the next one is panel okay so these are
the lines which are taken directly from
your shop and peter
and the question is being prepared in
such a way okay so the line first line
from shop and peter clearly says that
a panel discussion is a panel means
something like a group of
four to eight experts sit and discuss in
front of the audience okay so
they are going to sit and discuss in
front of the audience the audience are
allowed to question
allowed to ask ask different questions
and the chairperson sum ups the
different views from the different
people so it's an experts
panel of four to eight sit in front of
the audience and they are going to
discuss about the
particular topic from their view point
of view okay so this is a question that
is given the answer for this question is
panel discussion and last but not the
least is role playing or
social drama okay and this diagram is
related to the show show drama okay
so the size of the audience or the
content should be 25 around 25
the audience should take active part by
suggesting the alternative solutions
and even taking part in the drama
okay and this type of communication is
more effective so please do add this key
point that is it is
more effective and whatever this this is
a diagram based question of puppet show
puppet shows are generally
ah they are more familiar in the
villages and this this is a type of
social drama and this is
most useful in the children health
education so please do add
or highlight this particular point okay
this is more effective and useful in
children health education so the answer
for this particular question which is
given in the need the answer is panel
discussions
so going to the next question the the
process of
investigating the healthy individuals
with the objective of detecting the
with the objective of detecting the
unrecognized
diseases or its precursors
in order to take the preventive
measurements or delay the development of
disease or to make the prognosis better
is termed as
okay so it's termed as this a this is a
definition of screening okay the answer
is screening is a simple definition of
screening screening is the
is a process purposefully you are going
to identify the
unrecognized individuals or undiagnosed
clinically undiagnosed individuals by
which you are going to identify the
screening so screening is useful for
prevention
screening is useful to make your
treatment or your therapy more effective
and the screening is used to make your
prognosis more effective
so when you're talking about screening
this is a wh definition that is taken
from the textbook
so just for your academic purpose you
can add add a note of this
which is almost same as the question
that is given in the neet okay so just
just just read it off and just try to
understand it's almost the same the
definition
but screening the main useful uses of
screening is screening helps in
identifying the
risk factor identifying the genetic
origin
of the disease if the disease is genetic
coercion identify the precursors or the
ethiology
and helps in early detection so when you
detect the disease early
your treatment can be more effective and
your prognosis can be
better and better okay so and coming to
the screenings the medical screenings
are categorized into
three types that is mass screening where
enter population is screened
and multi or multiphase screening okay
which involves the use of
various screening tests in a sequence
manner it's almost like
your multi-phase sampling technique so
one level to next level for example
if you are planning to identify a person
or a group of people who are having
uh the tb the tb the first thing what
you need to do is first of all
you need to see the clinical features so
once you collect the
people who are having the clinical
futures then you are going to have
some basic tests okay some some some
basic test which helps in
identifying few people then you are
going to move to the
next level okay so this is how you can
you can move to the
basic test to the high-end test and this
is done in a multi-phase only in a
particular group of people
who moves from one phase to other phase
means once their test was positive only
the
positive tested people will will be
going to the next level okay that is
called as multi-phase or multiple
screening
and next one is prescriptive screening
technique okay
this aims in early detection of specific
disease
that can be controlled better which is
which is specific to a
specific individual okay so these are
the different types of screenings better
to make a note rather than
rather than leaving this because the
question was basically moves around the
simple definition of screening which is
a most commonly uncounted question
the next comes okay this is a i mean
like this is a ah
like study related question okay which
is already discussed you can go back and
check your cohort and the case control
study
which is there on the youtube channel
okay you can just check it off but the
question is very simple a group of
pregnant females
who were selected from the population
and their follow-up
ok so you have done a follow-up to
evaluate the risk of
development of anemia so you have taken
the pregnant woman
okay then you kept them under follow up
for nine months
that is the pregnancy period nine months
and then you have tested whether they
have got enemy or not so you are moving
forward
so what is forward moving study forward
moving studies
the simple cohort study okay so it's not
case control
okay ah okay both options are eliminated
so you have to go for coherent study
okay you have two options related to the
coherent study
but you clearly know that coherent study
is a prospective study
which is moving forward your whereas
your case control is a retro prospective
study which is moving backwards so it is
a prospect to cohab study
the answer is b for this particular
question if you want to have a good
details of the differences between the
case control cohart
or the examples related to the dentist
and everything you can just go back
uh to the to our youtube channel okay
click your case control and cohort study
okay you will get it you finish the
video and probably i'll try my best to
post the
links of the video in the description
the next question
most on the sampling technique okay so
i mean like there is a video related to
the sampling technique also
okay the sample and sampling technique a
video of 15 minutes
please go and and please try to finish
that okay
but it's a very simple question if we
need to select
10 students from a class of 100
what is the best technique of choice
it's very simple like if you know the
meanings of all the
four options which are given in the
question it's very simple the answer is
systemic sampling technique okay the
answer is b and
uh i i'll i'll try to explain it uh
with with examples over here okay so
stratified sampling technique is very
simple
like you are going to take a sample of
100 ok similarly i am going to tell you
for a school
so in which you are going to divide the
students into
different different groups okay for
example
people on different colonies for example
a school has
ah surrounding ten colonies and students
are from the ten colonies so
you're going to divide the students on
ten colonies once one colony will have
five or
six fifteen twenty something like that
all the ten colonies and you're going to
select
a particular group of individuals from
each colony two from here
one from here something like that so
this is called as
you are going to divide them into
subgroups then you are going to do the
random sampling technique that is called
as stratified
you are going to divide them into straya
the next one is cluster
cluster is very simple first of all you
are going to divide the people into
cluster same example i am going to give
for people of different colonies 10
colonies you got
in the previous study in the previous
study what is that stratified
you have selected the individuals in
each colony
but here you are going to select the
colony entire colony you are going to
take the sample from entire column means
here the sample is cluster means group
of people here it is the sample is
random means only one individual here it
is
one person from each cluster or
few persons from each cluster here
entire cluster is taken entire cluster
is taken
okay and of course you know the meaning
of convenience sampling convenience
sampling is something called as
accidental sampling means basing upon
your convenience you have selected few
people like for example
if i am doing a study i am more
convenient if i
if i take people who are more convenient
to me for example
i love to take my own students in the
study so that they will hear my words or
they will be under my control so that is
what my convenience is
so that is called as convenience
sampling so very simple just by knowing
the
uh like the terms you can easily answer
this question the answer is b
for this question b okay
so next question is of course once again
you have encountered a very simple
question that is
uh the association between the iodine
and god is an example of okay
so what is basically what is association
the first thing you have to make a note
what is association
association means a connection between
two factors
okay one factor how it is connected to
the second factor
so a simple definition says that
it is the co-occurrence of two variables
definition according to textbook is
it's a co-occurrence of two variables
right
so there are three types of associations
type one type two and type three
type one is suspicious
association type two is indirect
association
type three is direct association in this
direct association again you have two
types
one is one and one association second
one is multi-factorial association i am
going to give example
suspicious association means it starts
with letter s
okay it start with letter s suspicious
association means
you are suspecting but it may not be
true it is not true
but without any knowledge you are
suspecting for example previously
in the old era like 20 years back we
have a
a norm that when you give birth to a
baby in the hospital the death rate will
be more when compared to the birth
in the home so it's a it's a norm
okay but it's not true logically to
speak the death rate will be more when
you give birth
in the home but they have a norm that
they have some suspection which is
not true okay so that is called as
suspicious association which is not real
which is not real
or not true the second one is indirect
association
means if the the causative organism is
not
the primary agent which is responsible
for the occurrence of disease
but further like further like as
investigation goes on and progress and
progress
you you come to a conclusion that this
factor may also have
an indirect effect on the occurrence of
a disease means
it is indirect not directly associated
but it is going to cause disease so it
is indirectly going to cause a disease
so that is called as
indirect association i am going to give
an example for example if you talk about
the same example
the people are living in high altitude
high altitude and people the high
altitude people will get
brighter but it's not directly
association
indirectly it is indirect association
what is directly associated
for occurrence of god that is iron
deficient
sorry iodine deficient iodine deficient
is a direct cause
but indirectly your high altitude may
cause goiter that is this is an example
of indirect association
okay so coming to the direct association
one and one one and one means
only one agent is responsible for
occurrence of a disease for example if
you take
a particular bacteria okay that is hiv
hiv is caused by hiv virus only
yes right so it is one and one
association its one and one association
for example if you take multifactorial
care is kerys is a multifactorial
disease which depends upon many factors
so caries association is not a single
one-to-one
it is a multi-factorial association and
similarly you can take your
hypertension or cardiac problems most of
the cardiac problems are related to
obesity your lifestyle
your food habits and all these are
called as multifactorial association
ok right so i am going to give one good
example
ok which is given in the examination
your
iodine deficient irritant deficient is
going to cause
goit and this may lead to
thyroid adenoma ok
so the association between these two is
direct
for example if they are giving an option
what is the association between iodine
deficient and
thyroid adenoma is indirect because it
is going to cause gaud and the goit male
leads to thyroid adenoma
okay so the association between iodine
and this is indirect whereas the
association with identities
direct so the answer is direct
association it has
a direct association
hope you are clear with this three types
of associations and the definition of
association
and make sure you learn some good
examples so one to one are mostly
measles is going to cause measles
disease okay so
i mean like that that is one-to-one
association right direct
the next one again most commonly
discussed regularly discussed in the
classes
in a class of 100 students if the ranks
are given basing upon their
annual performance from rank 1 they are
telling
ranks ranks means one two positions
some gradings better is grading is a
better word for this grading
means you are giving rank one rank two
is a grade ok its not percentage
if they are giving percentage it is
going to be different like for example
out of 600
or will take your neet exam into
consideration
out of 960 how many marks you got
okay how many marks you got that is
number that is different
corresponding to that number they are
giving rank or they are giving grade
okay so what type of so first of all
learn what are
what is what what are the different
skills ok i hope most of you are
familiar with this
ok the different scales are the first
one is
nominal scale so what is nominal scale
there will be no specific order for this
specific order for this skill okay so
regularly what we do
okay male or female okay or
boys or girls or or like what is
from which country you are all these
questions are called as nominal skills
they don't have a
specific order the second one is ordinal
so ordinal has ordinal is also
qualitative nominal is qualitative right
nominal is qualitative
ordinal also qualitative okay but this
has
order specific order
for example if you take tnm
classification
it has grading it is called as grading
people of a classroom are divided into
grades a grade b
grade secret people of a classroom are
divided into ranks one first rank second
rank third rank fourth rank
and similarly like if you take the
severity of a disease hemophilia
you have severity of a disease very
severe or your
hypovolemic shock you have different
severities so all these severities are
going to come into this
ordinal scale then the third one is you
have to make another third one is metric
scale
metric scale is a number okay
hemoglobin percentage temperature of an
individual
marks of a person in the examination all
these are metric skills
so again in this metric skills you have
two types of skill
one is interval skill
and second one is rational skill so
interval scale
is very simple that it doesn't have
absolute zero value no absolute
absolute zero value and no ratios are
used
the best example is temperature in
centigrade
and temperature in foreign heat you
don't have 0 degrees
centigrade you have 0 degrees kelvin but
you don't have
0 degree centigrade 0 degrees fahrenheit
so there is no absolute zero value
and this cannot be this cannot be used
as a ratio
ok whereas your your relation is
you will have absolute zero value
and you have ratios the examples are
your hb
your temperature in kelvin will come
under this category okay
and your marks will come under this
category right so these are
the other types okay so make a note
about the different skills
which are very very important in your
examination point of view
the next comes of course this is just an
extension of the screening what we have
discussed
examination using a tongue depressor
or available illumination source comes
under which type
simple the answer is type four we are
going to discuss all these types
okay coming to the type one type one is
called as complete examination
where you are going to use a mouth
mirror explorer
light radiographs percussion palpation
test pulp vitality
study model lab test everything you use
everything
and coming to the point to be noted this
is not often used in the public health
it is regularly used in the diagnosis of
a particular disease
in a well a cubed clinic
or a well-equipped college and the
second one is the type 2 is
the limited limited type 2 is the
limited examination
type 2 is the limited examination that
is your mouth mirror explorer adequate
light
and the posterior bite wings are used
this is of greater importance in the
public health programs
combined with service to the individual
patient who is at a particular risk
type 3 is inspection examination
where these three are used and make a
node this is the most
commonly used in the public health
sector and i hope you remember this type
4
what we used to do this is called a
screening what we used to do in your
public health programs once you go out
to a particular village what you do you
use a tongue depressor available light
over there
and you are going to check the patient
by giving
the individuals who really require the
treatment okay
so make a note but this is too
unreliable for the
public health survey so basically we
have to
the most commonly used or the preferable
thing that to be used is
type three but the question is very
simple tongue depressant and available
light are most commonly used in
which type that is screening that is
type 4
the next question is very very simple
question okay
i mean like most commonly encountered in
your basic mcq books and
regularly we discuss it what is the
particular phenomenon
chalking of phenomenon okay so what is
this
like whenever you apply hf
so whenever you play hf the tooth has
the maximum content called as
hydroxyapatite this hydroxyapatite has
calcium in it
so what happens this fluoride is going
to react with the calcium
to form caf so this caf is so resistance
so resistance and it forms a reservoir
reservoir over the outer surface of the
teeth so for example if you take this as
a
ok as your teeth so whenever you apply
the tropical fluoride
this cf is formed on the outer surface
like this for example the red colour is
cf
and it forms as a reservoir of cf which
makes very resistance and does not
permit any
further fluoride to come inside the
fluoride this red colour is something
that is going to act as a barrier
and will not allow the fluoride the
green color fluoride to enter in
so this is what is chalking of
phenomenon it is very predominant and
common with n f ok so n f is the answer
c
is the answer for this question but how
you can overcome this
how you can overcome this very simple so
that is the reason why whenever you
apply naf you have to wait for four
minutes to dry off
so when it dry off what happens it's
going to dissolve in the oral fluids
this gf is going to dissolve in the oral
fluids
and this will be this red color area
will be removed
okay and the fluoride outside will be
entering inside so this is what
chalking of phenomenon how it what
precautions we have to take to
this take take to avoid this and of
course the second important area is
it is most familiar common with naf
the next question of course a very easy
question for most of the
final year students because this is one
of the important exercise in your
final year community examination
practical
so according to the cp cpitn index
if the pocket is four to five
millimeters what should be the treatment
done okay so this is the question
the answer is scaling and root planning
the answer is c will discuss
so before going in detail we have to
learn what is the cptn problem most of
you are well familiar with this
cptn probe but cptn probe is basically
of two types one is
epidermology and second one is clinical
uses clinical uses will have
more markings clinical uses will have
more markings here you can see more
markings and the
epidermology usage will have less
markings
so what are the markings for the
epidermology you will have
markings only at these two markings that
is 3.5 to 5.5 is the marking that is
present
and the ball is 0.5 millimeters diameter
and the weight of this is five grams the
weight of w h o probe is five grams
ah the other names is it is called as
ball and probe
because it has a ball at the end they
can ask you the diameter of this ball
and probe that is 0.5 millimeters
and this is also called as trs
621 probe this question was already
asked me know this is also called as
trs 621 pro so this is e pro
okay so what is c probe clinical uses
probe will have more markings
apart from 3 to 5 it has 8.5
and 11.5 markings also ok it has 0.5
3.5 5.5 8.5 and 11.5
markings so that is the difference
between the clinical proof clinical
probe is used in the clinical scenarios
epidermal
logical probe e probe is used in the
epidemiological scenarios when you are
testing
more population next goes okay
so go back and just please try to read
everything which is given in the show
and peter i am just focusing more on the
codes and the treatments okay so what
what is the coding so you have a
different coding that is x 4
3 2 1 0 very simple 0
is no signs of disease one is gingival
bleeding
two is presence of calculus three is
pocket of four to five millimeters so
normally
you will have a normal range is two to
three millimeters pocket will be there
right so if they are asking period
related question what is the
histological
depth of the pocket sorry so what is the
histological depth of the pocket means
it is 1.8 millimeters
ideally in a healthy individual in a
healthy ginger what is the depth of the
pocket healthy
healthy what is the depth of the pocket
zero millimeters clinical probing range
is
two to three millimeters so if it is 4.5
millimeters
or when the gingival margin is on the
black area of the probe
when you're comparing the probe anything
is same okay that coding is three
and if it is more than six or the black
area of the
cpi tn probe is not at all visible then
the coding is
more than six if when only
one teeth or no teeth are present in a
particular six set
okay or the third molars are excluded
or excluded unless they are functional
in the place of second molars
then you are going to see x c x is not
that important whereas your all these
4 3 2 1
and 0 are important so basing upon these
codes you have to plan your treatment
that is called as
tn so what are the tns tn0 is for
code 0 or codex there is no need of any
treatment
cn tn1 is code 1 that is you have to
advise the patient to improve their
personal oral hygiene 2a is code 2
where you have to advise scaling plus
personal hygiene
2b is code 3 scaling and root planning
plus personal hygiene so they have asked
a question on
code 3 that is they have given the value
is
four to five millimeters means which is
reflects the
answer as code three so what is the
treatment for code three
code three is scaling and rooting t3
tn3 is code 4 where you have to go for a
complex treatment apart from improving
the scaling
that is complex treatment needs nothing
but you have to go for flap surgery or
some surgical procedure
plus scaling plus root planning
clear so the question is four to five
millimeters
so the answer is scaling and repelling
if the question if the option is given
as more than six millimeters
then the answer is going to be the code
four or treatment
treatment required three that is called
as complex treatment and
of apart from improving the oral hyster
okay the next question
according to stefan's curve the ph above
which
remineralization occurs so if you take
rimerization demineralization cycle
so this is demineralization red color
and this is remineralization
green color so the ph above which
the ph above which the demineralization
will occur so
it it moves around 5.2 to 5.5 five point
two to five point five
is nothing but is a critical ph
so below five point two to five point
five demilitation occurs
above five point two to five point five
remineralization occurs
ok so the value should be somewhere near
to 5.2 to 5.5 the only one option is
that the answer is c
so you have to make a note the critical
ph is 5.2 to 5.5
and the critical period is 10 to
40 minutes so mostly
uh after after a period of one hour or
60 minutes
it drops to the original ph what is the
normal ph
is 6.7 to 7.2
so this is the question which is a
normal basic question when they ask the
same
teeth or tooth which is treated with
fluoride so whenever teeth is treated
with fluoride it forms
hydro flora apatite
or fluoro hydroxyapatite okay so fluoro
hydroxyapatite has a lesser critical ph
so normal critical ph is 5.2 to 5.5 so
fluorohydroxyapatitic critical ph is
4.2 to 4.5
so they can ask critical ph of enamel so
regularly when whenever they do not
mention
the outermost surface of tooth or teeth
is enamel so we consider it as enamel
5.2 to 5.5
or when when they ask dentin dentin is
six point two to
six point five they are cementum
cementum is seven
point two to seven point five so it's
just jumping
fluoride treated is four point two to
four point five enamel normal is five
point two to five point five dentin is
six point eight to six point five
cementum is
seven point two to seven point five it's
very easy to remember
and just make a note about these studies
and evidence based things which are
related to dental caries and
uh uh the most commonly as already we
have covered this in our power play
books the study is covered the study is
covered
the study is covered the study is
covered this is covered
so this is very very important text book
reference and i want everyone
to finish this off at any cost okay very
very important they can ask questions
over this area
again the next question is on dental
care so dental caries is
of course you know that the most common
disease in dentistry is
dental caries and of course they will
ask a decent number of questions on this
on this topic or on this disease and i
want everyone to
just try to focus try to learn as much
as related to the dental caries apart
from the basics what you have related to
this
so the question is most sensitive okay
so it's a direct line taken from the
book
so the most sensitive is surface okay
it's not the wood it is
surface index is the most sensitive so
i'm trying to collect all the indices
uh related to the dental caries uh okay
i'm going to post a notes
poster notes preferably as soon as
possible so we started collecting the
things and we'll be posting on it as a
reference source
so please try to finish that pdf which
is going to be posted on the group very
soon
okay so this is all for now related to
the community part of
neet 2020 so this is our ins
this is our telegram pace okay the link
will be shared in the description
if you want you can be a part of this
this is our instagram page mds conquer
underscore nbd conquer
ok where we are going to discuss the
diagram based stuff and everything
make sure you try to follow this and of
course we are planning to have a free
all india mock examination
uh like the date will be announced very
soon
and we are going to give a free
e-booklet
okay and make sure you drop your email
address in the comment box
