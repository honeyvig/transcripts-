website to rank higher in organic that
is unpaid search results in simple terms
SEO is all about making your websites
more visible to people who are searching
for the things online when someone types
a question or a topic into search engine
like Google as you helps your website
appear higher up in the list of search
results this means more people are

the shops on the Main Street than those
tucked away in an LA study shows that
organic search drives are whooping 53%
of all website traffic in fact a recent
survey by MOS revealed that 61% of
marketers consider SEO to be the most
effective digital marketing strategy so
in this video we will cover what is SEO
types of SEO how does SEO work things to
keep in mind while doing SEO access the
full spectrum of digital marketing tools
with chat gbt and AI tools complemented
by 35 Plus dedicated resources all right
so let's start with the first topic
which is what is SEO imagine you have a
fantastic store but it's hidden down a
dark Alle SEO is like putting a bright
lights and clear signs so so people can
easily find you online that's what SEO
stands for that is search engine
optimization it's about making your
website more visible in search engines
like Google when people search for
something search engin use complex
algorithms to rank websites SEO helps
your website take the right boxes for
these algorithms good SEO means your
website appears higher in search results
which can lead to more visitors and
potential customers it's like putting up
the big sign out hard your shop so more
people know you are there when your
website ranks higher in search results
it's like having a prime real estate in
the digital world study shows that most
people don't click past the first page
of search results so being at the top
can make a big difference in how much
traffic your site gets SEO isn't just
about getting more visitors though it's
also about attracting the right kind of
visitors people who are interested in
what you offer and are more likely to
become customers or engage with your
content by understanding what people are
searching for and optimizing your
website to match those queries you can
connect with your starget audience more
effectively so this was about SEO now
let's understand about the three types
of SEO all right there are three main
types of SEO you need to know about
first one is technical optimization so
this is like the backstage work of SE it
involves doing things on a websites that
improve its performance in search
engines but people don't see them for
example submitting your website sit map
to Google helps search engines
understand and index your site better
the next one is on page optimization
this is about making sure that your
content on your website is topnotch and
relevant to what people are searching
for you do this by using the right
keywords in your content and providing a
great user experience it's like making
sure your website is likable and helpful
to visitors the next is off page
optimization so this type of SEO happens
outside of your website it's all about
building your website reputation and
Authority on the internet one big way to
do this is by getting other reputable
websites to link to yours these links
called back links tell search engines
that your website is trustworthy and
valuable by understanding and working on
these three types of SEO you can boost
your website's visibility and attract
more visitors helping your business
Thrive online so this was about the
types of SEO now let's understand how
does SEO work so basically there are
some steps to how does SEO works first
search engine crawling search engines
like Google use automated programs
called crawlers or spiders to browse the
web so these crawlers follow links from
one web page to another collecting
information about each page they visit
they gather data on the content
structure and other elements of the web
pages which is then stored in the search
engines database now next one is search
engine indexing once the Crawlers
collect information about web pages the
data is organized and stored in massive
database called an index the indexing
process involves analyzing the content
keywords metatags and other factors to
understand what each web page is about
this index information allows search
engines to quickly retrieve relevant
results when someone performs a search
query all right now the third one which
is search engine ranking when a user
enters a search query the search engines
algorithms shift through the index pages
to determine which ones are most
relevant to the query the algorithm
considers various factors like keyword
relevance content quality website
Authority user experience and more to
rank the pages the pages that best
matches the search query and meet the
algorithms criteria appear higher in the
search engine results Pages websites
with strong practices including
optimized content quality back links and
user friendly design are more likely to
rank higher in search results so in
summary SEO that is search engine
optimization boost a website's
visibility online we discussed three
types on page focuses on content off
page builds site Authority and Technical
ensures smooth site operation SEO
involves understanding how search
engines find organized and rank websites

every step of the way each tool we have

to reach an engage your audience
basically Google follows three basic
steps to rank a website they need to
crawl your website they need to take
what they crawl back to their servers
and when they take it back to their
servers your your web pages they need to
you have them available for indexing so
when somebody actually types in a
keyword into google.com it'll be
available to be found on organic search
so that's what indexing is all about and
then Google's job when somebody does
type in a search query is to basically
rank th those pages that they've indexed
from number one to Infinity depending on
how many pages are relevant to that
search query so really it's about
crawling indexing and ranking so
crawling is simply a process done by
which Google has Bots and what these
Bots do is they go to your web server
and they're going to crawl every page
that they can find and how do they find
these Pages well they Bic basically
follow links you might have heard the
term spidering but that's what they call
search engine spidering so basically
what Google's doing is they're building
a web so to speak all the links that
they're following and so when they can
follow all these links on your website
they're going to be able to crawl them
and when they crawl them basically
they're going to take that content and
store it on their servers so it's
available in their index So based on
this method Google finds out which
websites have relevant content and which
ones don't based on certain keywords
that are typed into Google because if
they can't crawl your website you're not
going to be found and if you can't be
found then you're not going to show up
for Relevant keyword so we need to make
sure your sites available be crawled and
we'll talk about that a little bit later
okay but let's show you an example so
let's just go to Google Search and if I
type in the keyword simply learn okay I
can see I have 1,10,000 results okay and
that's how many results are showing up
for simply learn okay now they may not
all be simply learned pages but
nonetheless simply learned is rank
number one here organically and there
are
1,10,000 Pages related to the keyword
simply learn now when it comes to
organic search uh we don't want to get
it confused with paid search so anytime
you see paid search you're going to see
something that says add next to it okay
so we could see that there are paid ads
here but when it comes to organic search
those are generally below paid ads and
so that's where Google counts the
1,10,000 results and so that's the whole
idea behind crawling and indexing
Google's able to crawl simply learns
website and based on all the pages that
they gather they're going to make those
pages available in organic search so if
you type in a keyword and your web page
is not available for indexing then
you're never going to show up for that
keyword so that's why it's important to
make sure your website is available for
crawling and indexing and so when a user
types a query on search Google search
the most relevant websites that are in
Google's index are going appear in the
search results so in the example I gave
uh with simply learn well simply learn
is the brand name of the company simply
learn so there's a lot of relevancy
there so that's why you see simply learn
show up here organically number one like
we mentioned about what is SEO and why
SEO we talked about that user experience
so there's a lot of factors that go into
ranking relevancy being one of them so
in the simply learn example simply learn
is relevant to a lot of the simply learn
Pages because that's who they are simply
learn however simply learn also needs to
make sure that you know for their Pages
the page load time is fast meaning these
Pages load very fast for the end user
and Google also takes into account other
factors like how long someone is staying
on a website it or are they bouncing
meaning are they going to one page that
they land on and then leaving the
website okay and so the user experience
is very very important there are other
factors also like language and location
and so for example location if you do a
search say in India the results are
going to be a little bit different than
say the results in the United States why
because Google is indexing as many web
pages as they can find so if somebody's
doing a search in India their result
results may be a little bit different
than the results show up in the US
because Google has different Bots and
these Bots are crawling different pages
at different times and so Google's index
is updating continuously but it's not
real time syncing so if you do a search
in India you may not see exactly the
same thing because both search engines
the Google in India and the Google in
the US are may not be exactly synced up
so an example would be you know if
you're looking for Cafe so if you search
a cafe in say San Francisco you're going
to see different results now if you do a
search for cafes in Mumbai you're going
to see different results there's going
to be local search here at the top there
may be some paid search but again you
may see different results because one
location but two Google search engines
in India and United States google.com
aren't exactly synced up exactly at the
same exact time you do that search so
location is important language is
important and relevancy is important
along with user experience so all those
are important factors in how Google
ranks websites if you looking to boost
your websites traffic or dominate search
engine rankings then today's video is
just for you we are diving deep into
keyword research a crucial part of any
successful SE strategy by the end of
this tutorial you'll know exactly how to
find the right keywords to help your
content reach its full potential so
let's get started to kick off things
first let's understand what keyword
research is now keyword research is all
about discovering the exact phrases and
terms your potential audience is typing
into search engines Now by identifying
these keywords you can create content
that directly addresses what people want
to know by or learn about this not only
drives more visitors to your site but
also helps you connect with those those
who are most likely to engage with your
content in essence keyword research is
the backbone of a strong SEO strategy
guiding you in crafting content that
resonates with your audience now that we
know what keyword research is let's dive
into why it's so important picture this
you are hosting a party would you invite
random people who might not even be
interested or would you carefully choose
guests who are excited to attend so
keyword research helps you do the latter
by attracting the right guests to your
website when you know the exact keywords
your audience is searching for you can
tailor your content to meet their needs
this increases your chances of not only
driving more traffic but also engaging
visitors who are genuinely interested in
what you have to offer the better you
understand your audience search Behavior
the more effective your content will be
remember it's not just about quantity
getting the right kind of traffic is key
to conversions and overall success
moving on let's talk about about the
different types of keywords you'll
encounter in your research this is
important because not all keywords are
created equal and understanding the
distinctions can greatly impact your
strategy so short tail keywords are
Broad and usually consist of one or two
words like SEO or marketing now these
keywords have high search volumes which
means lots of people are searching for
them however they're also highly
competitive making it tough to rank for
them unless you have a very authoriz
website next comes longtail keywords Now
longtail keywords on the other hand are
most specific phrases like how to do
keyword research for SEO now while they
have lower search volumes they tend to
be less competitive and more targeted
attracting visitors who are further
along in their bios Journey for instance
someone searches for best budget laptops
for students is likely closer to make a
purchase than someone just searching for
laptops now next type of keyword is LSI
which is Latin semantic indexing
keywords now these are related terms
that search engines consider relevant to
your main keyword now for example if
your main keyword is digital marketing
then LSI keywords could be online
marketing SEO strategies or social media
advertising now even in this example if
you have given best leather shoes the
lsis would be official and Casual Wear
best food wear brand origin leather
shoes Etc so using LSI keywords helps
you create more contextually relevant
content
with search engines favor Now by
balancing these types of keywords you
can create content that appeals to both
Broad and Niche audiences giving your
website a better chance to rank well
across different searches so all right
now that we have covered the types of
keywords let's explore some of the tools
that can help you find them so keyword
research tools are like treasure maps
they guide you to the keywords that can
drive the most traffic to your website
number one is Google Keyword Planner so
Google Keyword Planner is a fantastic St
Point especially for beginners it's free
and provides a wealth of information
including search volumes and competition
levels for various keywords you can also
discover new keyword ideas based on what
people are already searching for next is
ahrs ahrs is a more advanced paid tool
that offers in-depth analysis it doesn't
just give you keyword data it also
provides insights into how difficult it
is to rank for a particular keyword as
well as click through rates CTR and
related keyword ideas so as is
particularly useful for competitor
analysis helping you see which keywords
for your competitors are ranking for and
identifying gaps in their content that
you can exploit now next comes sem rush
now sem Rush is another powerful tool
that goes beyond keyword research it
offers comprehensive data on keywords
including Trends over time and allows
you to conduct competitive analysis
track keyword performance and more sem
Rush is a go to for many SEO
professionals because of its all in one
capabilities so these tools simplify the
process of keyword research allowing you
to focus on creating content that will
resonate with your audience and perform
well in search engine results so with so
many tools at your disposal the next
step is figuring out how to actually
find the best keywords for your content
so here's a step-by-step approach number
one start with a brainstorming session
so you can list down potential keywords
related to your topic think about what
your audience might search for and
consider different variations of those
phrases so use the keyword research
tools we just discussed to analyze these
keywords pay close attention to search
volume competition and user intent the
goal is to find keywords that have a
good search volume but aren't too
competitive and next consider user
intent this is crucial ask yourself what
is a Searcher hoping to find if someone
is searching for best travel laptops in
2024 they're probably looking for
product reviews or recommendations daily
your content to meet that specific
intent and you'll have a much better
chance of converting those visitors into
customers so by following these steps
you can pinpoint the keywords that will
not only drive traffic but also ensure
that the traffic is relevant and likely
to convert now one of the most effective
ways to find high quality keywords is by
analyzing your competitors this might
sound like a spy mission but it's
completely above board and Incredibly
valuable so tools like sem Rush allow
you to see which keywords your
competitors are ranking for so this
gives you insight into what's working
for them and more importantly it
highlights gaps in their strategy that
you can exploit for instance if you
notice that a competitor is ranking well

optimization as the name suggests is is
the practice of optimizing web pages to
rank higher and get relevant traffic
from the search engine onpage
optimization includes both content and
HTML source code optimization search
engine optimization can be very complex
so when you're trying to understand it
for the first time I find it very easy
just to break it up into general
concepts that you might already have an
understanding of when you look at the
hundreds of signals that go into SEO
they can be broken up into either
relevancy or because sometimes it's both
popularity so relevancy and popularity
out of all these signals they fit into
one of these two things we're going to
break all the signals we have into these
two areas in this section we're going to
talk about the onpage factors that's
because these are the factors that you
have direct impact upon and you can make
a small tweak and have a big impact with
Organic traffic with your onpage
relevancy Factor
the primary onpage relevancy factors
that I'll cover in this lesson are title
tags and metad descriptions header tags
which are used for headlines and
subheadings website URLs and URL
structure image alt text internal links
keyword usage and site Maps let's start
with one of my favorites and that is the
title tag this is also called a page
title the page title is not shown on the
page now rather it is displayed on the
browser Tab and this is what makes it
highly important is that in addition to
being displayed on the browser tab it is
also the title tag or the page title
that is shown on the text in the Google
search results as the link to the page
the page title influences both the
click-through rates and people's first
impressions of our website next up we
have the meta description Now The Meta
description can be a bit confusing
the metad description is in the code and
it does not influence rankings but it
does influence
clicks people will see your snippet or
your page information in the search
engine results that gray text is the
metad description if you don't have a
metad description then it may pull
information from the
page you can affect this and improve the
ch of your metad description appearing
if you write a short descriptive phrase
of the content or the purpose of the
page and just because we edit these
elements does not guarantee that they
will show up I often say that we affect
the change but we cannot control it this
is because the search engine May
override your changes and show different
content in these
areas sometimes it may help and it might
be a better description but many times
it's not
now let's go to the next element the
header tags these are also referred to
as the heading and
subheading and this is how HTML was
built when the web was first
created it enables a logical hierarchy
of content so starting with the headline
then displaying a subheading and then
subheadings after that the idea here is
that you're establishing a hierarchy of
information so you start with the H1 one
like a newspaper there's only one main
headline per page it describes the main
purpose of the page then a subheading
the H2 this is how you break the subc
content into
subcategories obviously you'll want to
use a keyword in there as well you see
by describing the purpose of the page in
the headline and then again in a
subheading you're naturally going to use
your primary and secondary keyword words
because you're going to associate them
with the product or the purpose and the
benefit the key is to keep it short you
see after the headline are the
subcategories the H2S and then your H3
is typically used as a paragraph heading
now putting the keyword in these
headings alone does not make your page
optimized remember the purpose is to
provide a quick reference for people to
find the content they need within
seconds so short explanatory heading and
subheadings paragraph headings are very
effective and naturally you'll be using
keywords to help people locate the
information that is most important to
them now if we go back to the search
engine results page the serp there is
another element in that listing the page
title is the large Blue text The Meta
description is the gray text now the
green text is the URL of the page that
is listed this is the address of the
page just like the address for your home
the internet knows that the URL is the
address for that page this is extremely
important for SEO for a variety of
reasons the most important though is
your keyword usage I like to make sure
that I have at least one Relevant Word
in the URL now also here keep it short
one of the worst things you can do is
have a URL full of keywords or even
worse hyphenate them all remember people
use these
URLs they provide context for the page
people also copy and paste URLs into
Mobile messages emails and Social Links
so it is extremely important to keep
these short succinct and I like to say
readable now I've just briefly touched
about the importance of the URL and now
let's look at the URL
structure first let's start with the
primary core of the URL the domain name
in the examp example with the URL I have
here example.com that's the domain name
so this is the first thing that people
see with your online business now beyond
the internet this is going to be what's
in all of your ads emails brochures
business cards and online your social
profiles all of your marketing efforts
are going to drive people to this domain
there's a lot of advice about buying or
using domains that have your keywords in
them and unfortunately domains have been
being sold for decades so there's less
chance of finding a domain with the
keywords you want now the search engines
don't make the keyword used in the
domain a primary ranking signal so
that's good however the domain is your
business it needs to be memorable if you
have a very I call it a spammy looking
domain name with multiple words and
hyphens or one that's hard to spell or
confusing people are going to make an
initial impression off of that so make
sure you have something that's going to
make a great first impression here's the
rule for a domain name something that's
easy to spell and easy to pronounce
ideally sure it's something you can type
and share something you're going to be
able to put on a business card and be
proud of not something that you bought
primarily because you want it for SEO
reasons and you think with that you're
going to succeed as an example just
think about Amazon their domain name
says nothing about books and yet it grew
to be one of the largest e-commerce
companies in the world the same with
Alibaba or Google their domain names
were not the keyword but their marketing
and branding built their company now
everything after the domain is a
subdirectory this is based on your
website organization as an example if
you have a website selling shoes then
the subdirectory can be called shoes
it's easy right the subdirectory is the
folder that contains the relevant files
or Pages for that group think of a file
folder with documents inside the file
folder is usually based on a major
category of content or products now
inside the folder are individual
documents or Pages these files or Pages
usually come after the subdirectory in
this example you see the file. HTML the
next step in optimizing the URL is to
name the page in a way that explains the
content of the page to use our
e-commerce shoe website a page name
would usually be a specific product name
this way you would end up with domain
name SL SHO
as the category SL brame running shoe
insert that here if you've ever looked
at the HTML that make up the
instructions of the page you'll
understand a bit more of how search
engines get the information from the
page the text on the page in the markup
such as the headings provide
instructions as to where the text is
located the importance and prominence of
the text in addition to the arrangement
of the overall page HTML is a set of
instructions for a brow browser to
assemble the page and the search engines
use that as well now the search engines
spiders cannot see images as the
internet developed many attributes were
added to provide for accessibility and
additional features users that are site
impaired cannot see
images and the alternative text tag
describes the image further there are
many times when our bandwidth isn't
strong and not all of the images will
load in that case we need the alt text
description to provide the context of
the image and its purpose search engines
use this alt text description to gain
additional context about the page the
content of the image and its purpose now
we have an entire section on links but
at this point I just want to cover
internal links an internal link is a
link from one page on your website to
another page of your own website now
this is important from a relevancy
perspective
you'll see internal links in your main
navigation you'll likely have a link
that says home one that says contact us
or about our company what you're showing
to search engines and to humans is that
this section if you click on this link
is about our company or this is where
you find our contact
information you see these links are not
votes like external links however they
provide relevance and context to the
information on your own
website let's dive in a little more on
keywords when a search engine crawls and
processes your website it doesn't simply
look for the instances of specific
keywords it's a lot more complex than
that it's using a technology called
natural language
processing natural language processing
uses algorithms to try to understand the
meaning of text you see search engine
processing is attempting to be human
this is the same way that people see and
hear the words and we're using the words
to find the meaning expressed in the
words similarly when a search engine
goes to your website it may seek
keywords but it's looking for the
context of those words you may say
football but just having the word
football repeated throughout your
website isn't going to help you rank
specifically for football what you need
to do and what is more common in actual
human conversation happens very
naturally when we talk about football we
use naturally additional words such as
goal and referee and World Cup you see
Google and the other search engines are
going to take these into account by
usage of other synonyms and other common
words you present the context of a
bigger broader idea for your website the
next site signal that we have is site
Maps now there are two kinds of site
Maps
there's the site map that is for humans
and there is the site map that are for
search engine robots crawlers or
spiders the one that is for human is
called an HTML sitemap you've probably
seen these before the link is generally
in the footer of a website if you click
on it it shows you the major sections of
the website provide some search
functionality but looking at it as a
human it shows you the hierarchy of the
website and where to find important
information it shows how everything fits
together now there's something else that
exists called an XML sitemap it's not
linked from any page of your website but
exists as an independent file on your
server now this is something you can see
but it is formatted for search engine
spiders using a programming language
called XML it shows the hierarchy and
the priority of each of the urls of the
website every page every document every
image and it also shows the date that
each page was last updated or
changed so at this point we've covered a
lot of things that are important and
things that you should be doing when
optimizing your onpage content now let's
go a different direction and cover
things that you should not be doing
keyword stuffing hidden text repetitive
anchor text and cloaking the first one
is keyword stuffing now back back in the
early days of search engine optimization
people used to increase the instances of
words on the page now this is well
before natural language processing at
that time search engines were looking
for occurrences of specific words well
search engines they're very smart about
this what may have worked 20 years ago
or 10 years ago keyword stuffing does
not work you're not going to rank better
for any given phrase by including it a
dozen or more times on the page page in
fact you might get an over optimization
penalty by constantly repeating the same
word over and over focus on writing
content that engages with your visitors
and uses language naturally now the next
one is hidden text unfortunately I still
see this this is when you write content
that is solely for search engines and
not for people now typically is
attempted by writing a lot of repetitive
keywords as text coloring it white and
placing it against a white background
you see this was developed as another
way to add more keyword stuff text
without the user seeing the overuse of
keywords now it didn't work too well in
the past and it definitely does not work
today this tactic backfires in two ways
first search engines can tell when it's
white text on a white background it's
easy to tell from a computer science
point of view search engines read the
HTML and in the HTML are the instruction
for colors when you hide text modern
search engines are smart enough to
figure it out probably better than a
human now secondly it's done to hide
repetitive keyword stuff text which is
the second thing against you these
outdated unprofessional tactics will
most likely get a website penalized by
the search engines the next one is
repetitive anchor text you may have
followed a link to a page when looking
for a business or information and
instead of the information you want but
you get a page that doesn't feel like it
was written for people every sentence is
redundant repetitive and almost every
keyword is linked even when there
doesn't need to be a link it confuses
the flow of the information on the page
now again this used to be a tactic that
sometimes would work but it's no longer
helpful search engines and their natural
language processing algorithms have
advanced significantly they can tell
when something's not readable when
something is probably intended for
machines and rankings but not for people
search engines will figure it out please
don't waste time on redundant links
trying to inflate the relevance of your
links and Pages the last thing to cover
here is cloaking cloaking is the idea of
showing one thing to the search engines
and something entirely different to
humans now this is related to the rest
of the tactics I just covered it's
something that used to work but it was
expressly against the search engine
guidelines well it may have worked if
the search engines discovered it on your
website you could have been penalized or
dropped from the search engine results
entirely now we've covered all of the
most important onpage optimization
factors let's take a look at what the
theoretically perfectly optimized page
would look like in this example we can
see many of these elements being used
together you can also see that the base
keyphrase digital camera is being
repeated but always included with a
specific context first at the top of the
page is the URL which has digital
cameras in the address the page title
follows using the context of the
information and adding the word reviews
you can also see at the top of the page
that the main navigation and secondary
navigation also called the breadcrumb
navigation provides context of the
Page's location within the entire
website and natural keyword
usage the H1 headline is the key phrase
but also happens to simply be the best
title for the content of the page the
subsequent subheadings provide
additional information such as ratings
recommendations and
features the links provide relevant ways
to access additional content the image
utilizes alt text there are also clear
calls to action which provide relevant
offers to visitors as you can see the
context of all of the content is very
strong and sends a clear relevancy
signal to both search engines and
readers to conclude this section I'd
like to cover the top influencing
factors now sometimes you may find these
as lists but I found it a bit more
practical to separate them into
categories typically every year you'll
find these collections of lists from
surveys experts or speculation some are
from testing but honestly you can't ever
truly test a search engine as the change
a little bit with every algorithm so the
best thing is to take from these lists
these factors that are the tried and
true factors over the years that have
worked
consistently also those tactics that not
only make your website more effective
with users they tend to do well with
search engines so if a tactic serves
that Dual Purpose it's a good tactic so
these are not exclusive and have to
lists for every situation but guides and
indicators for you to use the top onpage
factors from surveys opinions and data
are these a relevant page title page
headings anchor text links a
keyword-based
URL a keyword or contextual file name
such as page name image name or PDF file
name alt text and images and finally
what you do with the content on a page
to make it more readable lists bullet
points and bolded text the top factors
for off-page linking tend to contain
these items the total number of domains
linking to you the number of Highly
influential domains linking to you the
number of unique domain IP
addresses the total backlinks without no
follow
limits the total relevant anchor text in
links to you and finally the the types
and context of keywords in Anchor text
links the domain also contributes
factors to your overall rankings such as
the age of the domain which would
include ownership information such as
the length of time owned and operated by
a company the real business information
tied to that domain such as the business
address being the same as the business
registration address for the
domain in addition the signal from
social accounts driving visits to the
domain functionally the search engines
also utilize some attribution based on
the quality of programming of the
website for instance taking care of the
basic search engine Protocols of the
robots. text file XML sitap and https
protocol websites that Implement these
features have shown that they are
familiar with search engine guidelines
and and
protocol now one of the changes over the
past few years has been the
implementation of page speed as an
increasing ranking Factor slow loading
pages with a lot of extraneous code that
slow the delivery of the page will be
penalized as they take away from the
user
experience optimizing the page code
speeding up the load time of the page
can directly impact your rankings and
this is closely related to the mobile
friendliness of your website if your
website is not mobile friendly it will
be limited in visibility as Google's
primary index is focused on mobile
devices and mobile delivery behavioral
factors are the newest factors and with
the Advent of artificial intelligence it
is making determining the intent and the
is making determining easier for a
search engine to derive a judgment of
relevancy based on
interaction while the extent of these
signals is not fully known it is
suspected that they are minor but
growing in importance these include the
amount of users that search for a brand
name business name and go to that result
showing brand awareness also the amount
of direct visits bypassing search time
on page pages per session which is also
called the depth of visit and lastly the
behavior of a Searcher from the results
page
how many results are clicked how many
times do they return to the results this
evaluation is looking to judge if the
results presented were satisfactory or
deficient for that
query the two broad categories of
ranking signals are popularity and
relevance of the onpage factors the page
title is the most important individual
field the URL is important and should be
memorable alt text is important for
search engines as well well as for site
impaired humans avoid keyword stuffing
hidden text repetitive anchor text and
cloaking natural language processing is
a technology that aims to understand the
intent that humans have when searching
for information and so off-page SEO is
simply the process of linking or
promoting your website using link
building and so if you remember I talked
about this earlier on there's two types
of links in internal and external
linking and so for onpage SEO we used
internal linking for off-page SEO we're
going to talk about external linking and
external linking allows us to improve
our websites recognition or relevancy or
credibility and why do we want to
improve our relevancy and credibility
and trustworthiness and Authority
because we want Google to know that our
web page is trustworthy it is recognized
by other websites and it is relevant for
a particular keyword and so if we can do
that using off-page SEO methods then
Google's going to rank our web page for
the keyword we want to be found for so
it's really off-page SEO synonymous with
link building and there's plenty of
opportunities to do link building it
just comes down to creating a strategy
so again some of the benefits to off
page well we talked about you know being
credible and trustworthiness and
relevant we need to do that in order to
rank but there's some other benefits
there so if we're have a link on another
credible website then it's likely going
to increase the traffic to our own
website it also creates high domain
Authority and so what I mean by high
domain Authority is if we have basically
links to other web pages pointing back
to us then basically our domain
Authority is going to improve and when
our domain Authority improves other
websites are going to want to link to us
so the higher authoritative we are for
our website then other web pages are
going to want to link to us and so the
more external linking we have the higher
the domain Authority so it all starts
with linking to other high domain
Authority websites so linking to a high
domain Authority website for example
having a link on Wikipedia that points
back to our web page creates high domain
Authority for us and it helps Drive
traffic so some of the other benefits of
off-page SEO are in credibility so if
we're linking from Wikipedia to our web
page it does create credibility for us
it also helps us increase our page rank
so remember that external linking helps
build domain Authority helps build
credibility trustworthiness and it's
going to in turn help us rank for that
particular page and then certainly not
last having a good off-page SEO link
building strategy increases our brand
awareness because if we're on other high
author websites Wikipedia or say a
social platform it's going to increase
our brand awareness and increasing our
brand awareness increases our
trustworthiness and so if somebody is
looking to say become a digital
marketing specialist then likely instead
of typing in digital marketing
specialist on Google they may type in
our brand name in this case simply learn
and so these are all the benefits to
off-page SEO so it's nothing more than
having links on other websites that are
pointing back to ours and again there's
lots of benefits it drives helps Drive
traffic and increases our Authority so
those are things that we want to take
advantage of when we want to rank and
the key behind off-page SEO or link
building is always going to be content
so from an onpage SEO perspective having
quality content allows that content to
be optimized for Relevant keyword and
ranked but also from an off-page SEO
strategy having highquality content
allows us to have other sites and it
doesn't necess have to be a website it
could be a social platform or it could
be another blogging platform or blogging
website link back to ours why because
the content is original it's natural
it's well structured it reads well and
so that's the whole idea behind off page
you can't have links on other websites
if you don't have quality content so one
of the ideas behind off-page SEO is not
only do you want to create good content
but you probably want to spend a lot of
time or a bit of time on others websites
so remember the example I used earlier
in this presentation about having an ice
cream blog and ice cream recipes well it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to say
spend some time on other blogs related
to desserts related to cakes related to
food in general related to vegetables or
other items that people could link from
so the whole idea is understanding who
else is out there who has relevant
content that you could share so you
could share your content with them they
can share their content with you and
generally that's how it works naturally
anyway in the web spere if somebody
likes your content they're going to link
to it they don't necessarily have to
wait for you to ask them but it might
not be a bad idea to understand who else
is out there that has content similar to
yours so that you can you know get a
link on that particular website or blog
post and so some other ideas behind
having external links pointing back to
your website is social media so social
media is not just Facebook or Twitter
but it expands beyond that there's
there's core there's medium there's all
sorts of content generated websites like
Reddit so the list goes on and on you
just need to find what's relevant for
your content if it's relevant for your
content then it's worth worth putting or
trying to get the external link on that
social media platform and then again
going back to my ice cream blog recipes
blog post yeah if you find a particular
blog that you want to have an external
link on there's nothing wrong with
reaching out to that particular blogger
you know in some cases very flattering
but in other cases if the content is
relevant then why not it's only going to
help your end user experience if you add
somebody who has say a Blog about cakes
having their link on your blog post so
there's nothing wrong with it because it
also adds to the user experience and if
you're going to ask somebody to put an
external link on theirs you might want
to be open-minded and make sure that
you're are able and willing to put an
external link on your blog post or
website pointing to their content that's
how the web Works especially if the
content of quality relevant and of good
nature did you know that 93% of alline
experiences begin with a search engine
that's a massive audience you are
missing out on if your website isn't
ranking high on search result pages that
is
scps but SEO can feel challenging filled

there all
right and here's the conclusion all
right so this is basically our blog post
so now let's say we want to optimize
this blog post and we want to do SEO on
this one sh so let's first just copy
this we'll copy this and paste in
our
document all right so this is our
document and we have pasted this all
right now let's go back over here and
let's say we want to write it in a more
familiar or you can say friendly tone
and in a more explanatory tone you can
also use so let's just write
this don't worry about the spelling guys
uh Chad take care of this all right so
let's see what are the changes in both
of these blog
post let's just wait to finish
it and here's the conclusion so this is
the second block post so let's
understand the difference uh in between
these two first we'll first check out
for this one start small begin with
manageable changes all
right as you can see here it is begin
with manageable changes take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to
nearby destinations or stand and stretch
during work breaks these small efforts
can add up over time all right let's
just see what is written over here in
the second block Post in the second
block post it is written begin with
manageable changes that fit seamlessly
into your daily routine for example or
for instance choose to take the stairs
instead of elevator walk or bike to new
nearby destination instead of driving or
stand and stretch during work breaks
these small efforts can accumulate over
time and contribute to your overal
Fitness so if you want to take the
second one which is a few changes it is
more bit
explanatory uh compared to the first one
we can just copy past this this one as
well so you can uh write a second prompt
as well in which if you want to write in
a friendly tone or in a formal tone you
can write like that all you have to to
do is to just write the prompt in chat
gbd let's just copy paste it we'll
replace it with the First with the
second
one all right so now we are back in chat
gbt so now basically we have the blog
post content basically we have the
content of it now we want to polish it
we want to select the best title out of
it and many more things so for that
let's just make use of prompts instead
of writing all these prompts by yourself
you can make use of the prompts that is
that comes with aipm chat gbt prompts
all right so let's just say we want to
write about the title we want to select
a perfect title for this blog post so
what we can do is we'll go over here and
first of all we'll select in topics
we'll go and we'll select copyrighting
because we want to write about the S
optimize title we want the best title
we'll select
copyrighting confirm
all right now after this you can just go
for prompts what whichever you
like I'm going to go for this one blog
post title generator as you can see also
if you didn't get what you wanted then
you can go for the search engine over
here you can just type let just say if
you want to uh want to if you're writing
a script basically and you want a
perfect title for it then you can write
a script generator or something like
that over here automatically whichever
prompts that are relevant to it will
come all right so we have selected this
one blog post title generator because we
have to create a title for our blog post
we'll click on this and now all we have
to do is to write the name of our blog
post the name of our blog post is we'll
select everyday Lifestyle Fitness in
everyday lifestyle let's just select
this
one all right now as you can can see you
can select the titles to write it is
five let's just select 10 all right now
the language you can select English and
many more languages are there we'll keep
it in English itself tone emotional or
default let's just be default itself
poetic default default itself we'll keep
it like this all right
now click on this let's just
see so according to chat gpta impr promp
these are the 10 best title that we can
Implement in our blog post now what we
want to do is select one best title out
of it all right so these are 10 we have
to select one out of it so for that
we'll go to Google Keyword
Planner so this is Google Keyword
Planner we'll click on this find your
campaign and keywords we'll click on
this visit Keyword Planner now you guys
might be thinking what is Google Keyword
Planner so let me explain to you
guys so this Google Keyword Planner is a
free tool that helps you find keywords
for your online content it shows you how
often people search for certain words
and phrases and how much competition
there is to rank for those keywords this
way you can choose the best keywords to
Target in your ads or blog post or
website to attract more visitors and
potential customers so it'll give you
the numbers basically which are mostly
ranking and having the competition all
right so we'll click on discover new
keywords and let's select where it is
we'll select the first
10 go to Google Keyword Planner and now
here we will paste
it so all 10 of them are pasted now what
we'll do is we'll click on get results
so after clicking on get results as you
can
see so this is average monthly searches
this is competition the we want the
maximum monthly searches Fitness healthy
lifestyle and low in competition so
according to your preference you can
select from here and whichsoever this is
100k to 1 million and many more more
topics you can select from here which
has low competition so as you can see
this treadmill has more uh average View
100K to 1 million but the competition is
also high so we should keep the
competition low as well so we should
keep in mind so we can select our best
title from it so whichever
suits all right after selecting the best
title we can go
to our what we call this blog post to
change the title so this is the new
title let's keep it like
this all right so now our title is done
now let's go back to chat
GPT and here is a chat
GPT and now let's go to
the it's layout now here we want to
write the content regarding that
regarding that title so what we'll do is
basically we'll go over here and we'll
select
SEO and once we have selected it we'll
go we'll select this prompt human
written 100% used s optimized article
now based on that title that we have
generated we'll write a complete content
on it we'll use the help of this prompt
so as you can see G gbt 3.5 turbo gbt 4
gbt 40 we'll select
this and paste our title this is our
title transform your life how everyday
Fitness can boost your help so now this
prompt will generate the content based
on this title all right
now let's
see as you can see transform your life
how everyday Fitness can boost your
health this is the content
outline the article outline you can
say so this is the introduction what is
everyday
Fitness then physical fitness
benefits and it keeps on
writing I believe it will it will be a
long article or
blog so you don't have to write too many
prompts for this you can just do this
and the whole thing will take care of it
own as you can see fqs are also being
generated by this prompt otherwise we
would have wrote another prompt for the
FAQ and many things are there that
should be in there in the article or
blog so yeah now we can select our
article or blog we can
say so we have the title we don't want
the outline let's
say we'll take it from here from the
introduction it's a long article I
believe as you can see this last
question is not completed but you can
click on continue generating and it will
complete that we don't want the last
question I think three questions or four
questions are sufficient for us so now
as we have copied it first of all we
need to make sure that our content is
unique it is not plagarized because we
can't publish or use the plagarized
content so we have to be sure that we
are using the unique content for that
we'll have to go to this site known
as duply checker
we'll click on this first link and now
as you can see here we can copy and
paste it paste we can just exclude this
last question as I told
you all right now our content our
article is pasted now we will check the
plagarism
all right first of all we'll have to
tell them that we are not a robot and
then we have to click on check
PLM all right so it is showing maximum
thousand words allowed per search all
right so let's just do one
thing we'll do it because if you want to
do thousand words you'll have to go for
the pro version or the premium version
so we now have
to use some part of it not the complete
part it's actually a long article so
from the rule we'll take
as you can see number of words is 5
not5 and result found zero 0% plagarism
12% uni all right so plagarism is uh 3%
I think that can be that can we can
neglect it and now let's check for the
rest of this
one all
right all right here we'll copy and
paste it
check
plagerism as you can see number of words
671 0% plagarism 12% unique so I don't
think it'll be a problem so it is good
to go I believe and now we just copy and
paste it
so
let's take it from
here till
here all right so this is our content
now so our content was not plagarized
but let's just say it is plagarized and
is not unique so what should we do then
we can simply put a prompt in chat gbt
that make it non- plagarized or make it
unique or rephrase it but let's say uh
that plagerized Checker the duply
Checker mentions the particular lines of
where there is plagerism so you can
select that line put into chat gbt and
ask them to rephrase or make it
plagarism free by doing this you can
make the complete content plagarism free
it is very easy or else you can use a
prompt from aibm as I told you all you
have to do is to just type plagarism
free content writer and a particular
prompt will come you can just put your
content in that prompt and the rest Chad
JD will take care of all right now to
boost your SE strategy you must focus on
EAD that is expertise authora liveness
and trustworthy
and keep that human element strong use
chgb to improve your content with
interesting verified facts and relevant
examples create a FAQ section to answer
Comm common questions and look for any
missing information to fill in these
steps will help you make high quality
content that connects with your audience
and ranks better in search engines so
for that we'll write a prompt to chat
gbt to include the we call FAQs and the
uh statistics if you want to uh make use
of statistics and FAQ and include it in
our content so how should we do that
let's just understand it let's come to
our chat GPT again now here what we'll
do is we'll write a simple prompt
saying no no no first we go to the new
topic now here because otherwise it will
keep on writing in that prompt itself
all right we'll write
please add to what we call
stats or you can write
statistics and one
analogy and uh fa
AQ
section with
answers to
this content
draft to
increase
engagement all right now you want to uh
if you want to paste a particular
section of your content you can also do
that or else you can paste the entire
content it's as per your choice so let
me just paste a particular
section let's just paste this one and
all right let's
see all right so as you can see
statistics studies show that engaging in
just 30 minutes of modate physical
activity each day can reduce the risk of
chronic disease like heart disease so
these are the statistics and these are
the analogies and this is the FAQ
section
that you can include in your content or
a particular section of the content
usually these statistics are included in
the introduction part to make it more
interesting so you can make use of it
and do that all right moving forward
let's understand the chat GPT prompts
for meta titles and descriptions so
crafting meta titles and descriptions is
essential for drawing readers attention
so it is necessary that we should use
that all right so uh now we'll be WR
writing a particular prompt for it for
that for the content part I'll be
leaving the
space content here
and
create a meta
description and title for this content
here this mean this one all right
including the keyword now here we'll

keyword all right so whatever is the
focus keyword or the primary keyword you
want to include it in all right and

can you have to use the entire content
but I'm just showing showing you so you
can use this one it will be more than
enough don't have to worry about it
and the focus keyword

many other SEO software options SEO
powerit offers a One-Stop shop for
optimizing your online presence and
achieving better visibility on search
engines all right now the question must
arise how do I use SE power suit so for
that we will focus on things that is
keywords on page SEO back links and Link
building and first we'll have to focus
on keywords for that we will be
navigating to rank tracker all right so
this is our rank tracker we'll double
click on
it so rank tracker is a valuable tool
designed to assist you in discovering
profitable keywords monitoring your own
rankings as well as those of your
competitors and conducting thorough
competitive analysis also it serves as a
comprehensive solution to enhance your
understand understanding of keyword and
overall market dynamics so first of all
we'll have to create a project over here
so over here we'll have to type the URL
of this website and so I will just type
here
b.com it's an e-commerce site all right
so now we'll click on next then again
we'll connect on next and here you can
enter the keywords if you want and if
you don't want then you can proceed by
clicking on
next here you can add more search
engines Google Bing Yahoo ask.com I mean
it's your choice if you want to add it
or not I just don't want to add all
these Google and Yahoo are sufficient
then we'll click on
finish all right so our project is
getting ready all right so it is loaded
so first of all we'll start by
understanding the menu bar so the menu
bar is like the control center like of
rank tracker offering a set of drop-
down menus that help you manage your
projects and preferences so let's
understand first so this is file so this
menu handles basic commands relating to
your project such as opening closing and
saving files it's a goto for managing
project files efficiently then there is
preferences as we can see here in
preferences uh you can set up Global
configuration for the application and
customize settings specific to each
project it's like the headquarters of
triling rank tracker to suit your needs
then there is window so window this menu
provides a list of supported hot Keys
like keyboard shortcuts and allows you
to quickly switch between different
modules or sections within the
application it's all about making
navigation and action more efficient so
you can also learn these shortcuts as
well then there is help so in The Help
menu you can find information about your
rank tracker uh license along with the
links to online help resources if if you
ever need guidance or have questions
this is where you can find the
assistance all right then here comes the
project as you can see project this menu
is like a project management Hub it
displays a drop- down list of all the
projects currently open in rank tracker
allowing you to easily switch between
them so only one project is there so it
is showing that only now the next one is
new so the new Option lets you create a
fresh project and then open is there use
this option to load an existing project
from your hard drive or cloud storage
then save we all know save your open
projects with this command you can do
that then close this option allows you
to exit then as we can see check all so
check all rankings in all the open
project simultaneously with this command
it streamlines the process of gathering
information across your various projects
then you can also login like found in
the SEO powersuit Cloud login area this
is where you log to access Cloud related
features all right so this was about the
menu bar now coming to the sidebar so
quickly let's understand this one so
first of all there is the dashboard as
you can see project dashboard this is
your project Central Hub it provides a
visual summary of key statistics related
to your organic traffic ranking progress
and how well your competitors are doing
it serves as a quick gateway to all main
project sections then there is rank
tracking for in this module you will
find a list of keywords your targeting
it shows their ranking history traffic
statistics keyword efficiency index Kei
keyword difficulty and other essential
data that you may need to update
regularly so it is like that all right
now as we can see next is keyword
research so here it is so here you can
explore new keyword ideas using over 20
different tools like it is in there the
module allows you to analyze and
categorize new keywords into groups and
move them to Target keyword
section all right so as we can see these
are that 20 different tools the tools
that we are talking about then there is
Sur analysis that is SCP analysis this
is for in-depth keyword analysis it
provides you detailed analytical report
on websites competing with you for the
same queries then competitors research
this module enables you to research on
competitors based on domain or topic
domain strength it offers overall report
on your website's SE strength showing
how it evolves over time then there is
reports this module is for generating
and you know delivering reports to your
clients and I think that would be
sufficient so we have already created a
project and while creating a project you
can add seed keywords that you know
describe your business or use the ones
the tool suggest then see where your
website stands for and it helps you
understand how well your site is doing
in search results so the next step would
be analyzing so first of all for
analyzing that first of all we'll have
to go to keyword research we click on
that and then ranking keyword is there
as you can see all right so now here you
can type the name of the competitor and
click search so let's just say I want to
type the name of the competitor the so
store let's
say all right now I'll click can
search make sure the URL is
correct and it might take some time it
is fetching something it is collecting
the keywords and then it will compare
the keyword profiles all right so this
is what it is this is the result and as
we can see keywords and this is organic
traffic this is URL of the sold
store and these are the keywords as we
can see so these are basically the
keywords for which the competitors are
ranking and access their performance we
can you can have the option to
investigate any competitor of your
choice or rely on rank tracker to
recommend the most relevant ones within
your specific
Niche now after this you can explore
keywords with various keyword research
methods like keyword Gap search console
Keyword Planner autocomplete tools
related searches keyword combination Etc
so as you can see see all these are over
here you can have a look at these and
explore these meanwhile we can explore
this keyword sandbox as you can see
keyword sandbox with the help of this we
can filter our keywords which is the
next step all right so this is keyword
sandbox now we'll utilize the metrics
provided in the module to identify and
filter potentially lucrative keywords
eliminating those unlikely to generate
relevant traffic for our website
so factors such as search volume as we
can
see and keyword difficulty and
competition can guide you in selecting
Target keywords effectively so as you
can see these are the search volumes
and this is the competition competition
is high for this
keyword and keyword difficult is also
mentioned so you can filter out the
keywords according to your choice you
can either select or stop like drag like
we can see so it's your choice you can
filter out the
keywords so whichever you don't want to
you can just click on it and it will be
dragged now your keywords will appear
also in the track keyword so like I have
tracked this one and this one so in
track keywords I I can have a look at
these all right so this was about it
next we will go to the website
auditor so website auditor and sure your
website is optimized on the page and
checks if it functions well technically
and in terms of content
optimization so we'll open the website
auditor and then we'll type
the website that is
bof.com
right we'll click
on
finish all right so as you can see
to get a good ranking on search engines
it's important to optimize your site
first of all in terms of both technology
and content we will be using website
auditor for this job but before that
let's have a look at what all things are
there so first of all we'll explore
similarly that we explored in the
previous one so this is the menu bar and
I think we have explored this and this
is the sidebar it is bit different from
that so let's explore the sidebar so
site structure we have as you can see
this section organizes all the elements
of a website including its pages and
resources it provides like a visual map
of the site along with an audit
dashboard that accesses various Su
factors so as we can see page audit over
here now the page audit will do the page
level analysis so this was the function
of page audit then domain strength is
there so this feature offers
comprehensive report on overall strength
and performance of your website domain
showcasing its growth over time after
that there is reports this module allows
users to generate and share reports with
clients it serves as a tool to
communicate the findings and insights
obtained from the analysis of the site
structure and domain strength so this
was about the sidebar now we can start
with the little demo so first we have to
create a project that we already created
and wait till the tool crawls and
collects all the pages on your website
so that we have done all ready now we'll
go to site audit so as you can see here
under site structure site audit now
after visiting site audit we'll address
each technical issue systematically
following the tools recommendations to
eliminate all the
discrepancies so as you can see we are
not able to see any error as you can see
error zero warning is one information is
one so there is nothing exactly to be
fixed but if there is some error or
something is there there then we can
easily do that with the help of this
tool all right so next we can do is
visualization as we can see over here
under site audit you click on that now
to ensure visualization basically is
used to ensure your site is well
structured the tool transforms your
website into a visually intuitive app
once generated you can effortlessly
Sport and address like issues orphan
Pages isolated sections redirects broken
links and more so this is what it is
used for on the right side you can
arrange the pages based on the click
depth as we can see click depth internal
page rank page
views so on the right side this is the
right side and if you switch to internal
page link as you can see we'll click on
that you can see how the internal link
are spread it like it is bit different
sorting by Page views if you see
it lets you see which pages are visited
and viewed the most and least but we're
not able to figure it out as of now for
that I think we'll be needing a Google
analytics account and we'll need to log
in with that all right so after
reviewing and addressing on page
optimization for the site let's revisit
the keywords you gathered in rant
tracker like use website auditor keyword
map as we can see keyword map for
keyword map we'll have to go over page
audit inside page audit it is keyword
map now this module automatically
identify the pages most relevant to each
keyword
group so the program will take a few
moments to harvest all the data for your
keywords and Pages for further analysis
first of all you'll have to type the
keywords all right let's
say I want to
write
joggers watch
printed
T-shirts
shirts
sliders
and you can write as many as givers you
want
jacket hoodies
shs all right I think that is
sufficient now you can
also import from CSV so basically uh in
the rank tracker you can also download
an import from CSV or you can import
directly from rank tracker also now we
have rote the keywords over here now
we'll click on create map now the
program will take few moments to harvest
all data for the keywords and the tool
automatically identifies the pages most
relevant to your keyword group or
specific keyword so this is showing only
one it should at least show five because
website auditor will suggest the top
five most fitting Pages for each keyword
of group
so we must add more keywords I believe
we can add manually or we can just have
a look at rank tracker also like
hellfire club shirt we can see
can add
that all
right all right so still it is showing
one so after finding a match as you can
see we have find the match just hover
over the page and click map as you can
see we'll have to click on this or this
relevant it is
all right
so we'll have to hover over this and
we'll click on map now with the ready G
map ensure your landing page is
optimized for Target keywords now we'll
go to content audit first so here we can
adjust the target settings set the
default search engine for competitor
page and assign a specific one for the
current page so as you can see they are
showing the errors and warnings
so that we can improve on it and as we
just showing make your page meta
description approximately 22 word long
so it is showing how to fix also
basically and it we talk about
competitors we can see
Amazon and many other hm hm is there
American Giant
Nike so they have used the keywords
they're showing the meta description it
is
showing all right so now coming to the
content editor
so this is content editor basically what
it does is to start editing an existing
page you will need to choose between the
editing modes first of all as you can
see so it might take some time when you
click on that after doing that it might
take like 5 to 10 minutes after it will
show this
window now you'll need to choose between
editing modes browser mode is there and
document mode is there so let's just
select browser mode and let's click on
go you can easily
you know edit this site also and
properly write an SEO optimized title so
as you can see 33.2% optimization rate
is there it is showing and other than
that we can click on
this and this is showing us manage
mapped keywords manage search engines so
manage search engines so this will
change the default search engine set a
separate search engine for the given
page this can be helpful when optimizing
for creating a Regional or local page
and click manage search engines you can
also do that all right so the two top
Fields as we can see this one this one
so these two Fields will let you edit or
enter The Meta title and meta
description tags and you can see how
those fit into the intersections the
recommended number of characters based
on the best SEO practices so as you can
see 3111 160 you can easily edit that
and make it SEO friendly also all your
target keywords will show up in the
mapped keywords as you can see the
mapped keyword hoodies
so the green here it is green so green
means okay orange if it was orange it
means almost there red as an alarming
for neglecting or stuffing so next to
each keyword as you can see you will see
the actual keyword Count versus
recommended so the recommendations are
customizable simply click on any chip to
Manu change the
recommendation so you can do that then
the recommend recommended keywords this
section will list the keywords that have
been extracted from the top ranking
pages of your competitors so you can
also include these as per your
choice and then you can save in an HTML
document from here and you can reset
from here and save so once finished save
the page and upload it on your website
so so now let's just go to back
links now for back links we'll have to
go to SEO spy glass it is a useful tool
for checking backlinks it helps you
gather and analyze your own backlinks as
well as those of your
competitors so it's a good tool so again
we can write the website URL so we'll
type
b.com all right now we'll click on next
Su power
suit and we can also change this as per
our
choice let's
say We'll click on so these were the
number of backlinks so I've wrote
10,000 so it is collecting back links as
of now please wait while seos spy glass
collects backlink statistical data and
builds up the project okay so these are
the number of backlinks that this site
has
130,000 domains
9,622 and IPS
8361 all right so these is is the this
is basically the data so search engines
prioritize websites that have backlinks
from reputable domains conversely an
abundance of backlinks from spammy sites
can negatively impact your domains
reputation also considering this it is
advisable to access your existing
backlink profile before embarking on an
any efforts to build it further so this
involves examining and evaluating all
the back links already directed to your
site so we are going to do that and SEO
spy glass is one of the best tool for
that so step one find the pages linking
to your site for that to gather all the
back links directed to your site you
need to initiate a new project in SEO
spy glass that we already did and now we
can navigate to backlinks
profile we click on back
links all right so the tool will examine
its index and identify all the backlinks
providing a variety of useful metrics
essential for further
analysis so as we can see backlink page
domain in link rank link page links back
so all the back link pages are there it
is also showing
130k back links all right now coming to
the linking domains
so in linking domains module you can
quickly switch between all domains new
or lost
ones and additionally set the program to
show all tlds or filter out any specific
one
like
in.org
g.net so like
that all right now the anchor texts so
the anchor text module will show the
summary viget with the total number of
unique anchors and anchor diversity
diagram and backlink distribution of
anchor type the workspace will list all
the anchor texts associated with
backlinks in the project alongside
you'll see the states for each anchor
like link type as we can see and number
of back links you can also see
847 and linking domains Etc also
hovering over uh any cell in the back
links domains call you'll see the icon
of expanding the list of URLs to look
through so as you can see these are the
backlink page list of
URLs all
right now let's move on to the referral
traffic and to analyze the traffic your
website is getting through the backlinks
turn to referral traffic module this is
the referral traffic module until
backlink profile this is a backlink
profile if you want to analyze your
website you can come here in your S
Class once you click the update traffic
Button as we can see over here update
traffic
stats or this also will work oh this one
only once you click on this the program
will ask you to connect your Google
analytics account and if you haven't yet
then you can enter it so this is how it
will work so once the account is
connected it will take few moments for
the program to gather the data from
Google analytics or the backlinks in the
project after the task finishes you'll
see the results in the workspace you can
then switch between views linking
domains and backlink pages so the
linking domain view will show the
overall number of referral sessions
received from each domain and the
overall bounce rate the backlink pages
view will show the more detailed data
referral session from each backlink page
and also the bounce rate for each linked
page all right now let's navigate to
backlink profile and then we'll go to
summary
So within this module examiner summary
you can like including key metrics to
identify both the strength and
weaknesses of your site now we can peek
at your competitor's backlink profile
also now is the moment to access your
backlink profile in comparison to your
competitors achieving Superior SEO
performance is crucial for securing a
higher ranking than your competitors to
do that go to domain comparison first of
all as you can
see now this is our
domain now here we'll type the
competitors's domain let's like this the
so
store all right the spelling is wrong
the sold store
this all right click then there is
Snitch do cod.
in all
right and one more is there let's
write
nra.com
all right now let's click
okay so once this process is finished
you'll see a complete comparison of you
and your competitors's domains as we can
see
b.com the so store snitch do.in minra
now you can easily compare on the basis
of different metrics there are various
metrics over here and as you can see
there is a number
91% in terms of text links domain
strength 9.33 is of mintra and 7.99 of
pof.com and these are for snitch and
these are for soul store.com so you can
easily compare them on the basis of
different metrics all right now coming
to The Next Step which is spot the
dangerous links before progressing to
actual link building phase it's crucial
to address one final task identify and
remove potential and harmful backlinks
so for that we will go to backlink
profile then the penalty risk so
backlink profile this then we'll go to
penalty
risk all right so this is the penalty
risk it is showing 0% which is a good
thing so basically links with a penalty
risk of 70 to 100% are high risk and
should be checked right away as they
could lead to Google penalizing your
website basically links with a risk of
30 to 70% are potentially harmful so it
is advisible to examine them more
closely then links with the 0 to 30%
penalty risk are considered safe and
posst minimal or no risk in your link
profile all you have to do is to collect
those harmful links and get rid of them
so as you can see there are no penalty
risks so but I need to tell you how to
do that so we'll go to backlink pages
and we'll click on the particular link
as we can see so this button update
penalty risk so it will task updated
backlink page data so it will update the
penalty risk all right so this was about
SEO spy class now let's do the link
building with link
assistant so this link assistant
simplifies your link building tasks it
assists in discovering numerous link
building opportunities managing Outreach
and overseeing your link building
campaign directly within the app so
first of all we'll create a project and
specify the site and backlink and Target
settings all right so as we can see uh
we can like first of all we'll type
b.com right now so as we have provided
the web address select your desired
Target country so Target entry over here
and the language also you can select
from this and other than this the app's
search engine will be tailored
automatically according to your
preferences addition Al you have the
option to include negative keywords in
the top block list so what this is the
app will analyze the backlink profiles
of potential prospects and eliminate
those containing the specified negative
keywords so if you want if you don't
want some negative keywords you can put
it here in the topic block list and that
will not be included all right so this
was it now let's create on I repeat now
let's click on create
all right so this is the layout now so
first by default this will include the
list of top 100 backlinks or the
competitors of your domain with the
highest s link Rank and you can select
any of the six predetermined methods as
we can see six predetermine methods or
the configure a customized search this
one configure a customized search using
the export mode this is the export one
basically so these options enable you to
conduct a focused search based on
specific type of Link Prospect you're
seeking if you lack seed keywords you
can utilize the get keyword suggestion
feature this function automatically
identifies your top 20 ranking keywords
that generate the highest
traffic all right so now step two would
be let's say let's explore this one
guest posting top 100 blocks we'll click
on this all right so by employing this
search technique you can identify the
top 100 prospects ranked by organic
traffic using specific search operator
related to your seat keywords to
initiate the search input the seat
keywords here you will write down the
seat keyword so let's say I just want to
write winter
Weare all right
and you can also do the search engine
settings and I think it is fine and tags
for Future Organization and management
but I don't think I'll be doing it so
after completing the search first of all
we'll have to click on find so let's
click on
this so these are the contact
information this is the page previews
and this is the prospect preview and
additional details are also there you
can select or unselect all the results
to be moved to the prospects like
this right so then we'll click on move
to projects on hover move any result to
prospects to backlist or to the trash
also so let's just click on this we can
also click on remove Prospect but we are
not going to do that we'll just move to
prospects all right so these are the
prospect that you that we have moved now
that we have possess a recently compiled
list of potential links it is crucial to
access their quality and prioritize the
ones we intend to reach out to initially
we'll go to process
prospects all right then we'll click on
a URL and update so here is the update
and select contact info so as we can see
contact info we'll click on okay now
that we have settled on the list of
factors you would like to check take
respective data by clicking on the
update button or any of the columns
header take the factors to be updated
like I'll click on uh contact
information and press okay like
that all right can do for this one
also all right so the next step is to
reach out to prospects utilize the app
to initiate Outreach directly taking the
convenience of having all the contact
details at your disposal by connecting
your email account to link assistant you

everyone's contact info simply link your

develop Google analytics I'm very
excited to be with you today because
Google analytics is one of my favorite
Google platforms and my favorite topics
so let's talk about what we're going to
cover today and we're going to start out
with how to set up a Google analytics
account and so we're going to talk about
everything that entails including
creating your Google analytics account
we're going to talk about setting up a
property in your account and what a
property is is we're going to talk about
setting up a reporting view in your
property and we're going to talk about
installing the tracking code so those
are the series of steps we're going to
go through today in terms of setting up
a Google analytics account so let's get
right to it and so really the BR
prerequisite here when it comes to
setting up a Google analytics account is
to have a Google login and ID so when
you actually go to Google analytics you
need to be able to sign up or sign in
and so once you actually sign in then
you're going to go walk through a series
of steps but really that's really all
you need to get the account going is a
Google ID and login so if you have a
Gmail account or other email account
that you use for other Google products
then you're good to go that's all you
need to do so when you actually go to
sign up for Google analytics you're
going to be asked to set up a new
account and these are the series of
steps you're going to walk through or go
through to set up a new Google Analytics
account so you're going to choose an
account name and then you're going to
choose a property name okay so the
account name can be anything you want it
to be the name your company your name
whatever you want to name it the
property name is really the website name
so what website are we talking about so
here I'm going to set up a fictitious
website name for now it's called demos
simplylearn so the URL for this website
demo simplylearn is going to be demo.
simply learn.com so that's the property
when we talk about properties in
analytics we're really talking about
what websites we want to measure and
then you're going to be asked to choose
an industry category and so for simply
learn we're in jobs and education but
you have a number of different
industries that you could choose from
this is important go ahead and choose
the most Rel an industry that your
particular business is associated with
okay and I'm going to talk about why
that's important here in a minute and
then you're going to choose your time
zone and the time zone is also important
because that's when the day starts in
analytics and the day ends based on that
time zone so the data that Google
analytics collects starts and ends with
that time zone so very important to
choose the time zone your business is
located in okay and then you have some
additional options here okay so you have
some settings and so the first setting
is to allow Google products and services
so if you opt into this then basically
what Google's going to do is share some
products and services with you via email
I would go ahead and opt into that
that's of course recommended by Google
it doesn't hurt to hear from Google on
related products and services that may
enhance your business the second is
benchmarking so benchmarking to me is
something you should opt into so going
back to that industry and category we
chose jobs and education so by opting
into benchmarking basically what
Google's going to do is share your data
that it collects on your website in this
case demo. simplylearn
docomo to do the same exact thing for
you it's going to share Anonymous data
on other websites in the same industry
and the benefit of that is we get to see
what other websites or how other
websites are performing compared to ours
what's the Benchmark in our industry and
so the benchmarking to me is important
and I'm going to go over that in a few
minutes when we go over the different
reports but to me I would always opt
into benchmarking because this is the
only report Google provides an analytics
about how others in your industry is
performing versus your website okay so
it's a way to compare your website
performance against others in the same
industry the other options here
technical support and account specialist
I would also recommend you opt into
those because then it allows you to
basically Google allow Google access to
your account and they'll be able to help
you if you occur or run into any issues
so these are the options in setting up a
Google analytics account it's very
simple very easy to do you're just
entering in a few Fields note that we
talking about a website right now so I'm
talking about demo. simplylearn decom
but just know that if you want to track
a mobile app Google analytics will allow
you to do that as well you just choose
the option mobile app so we're tracking
a website we want to know how users
behave when they get to my website and
that's what Google analytics is going to
allow us to measure and look at we just
need to do a couple more steps in the
process so once we fill out these fields
here we're going to click get tracking
ID now I'm going to accept the terms of
service I'm going to accept another
terms of service in relation to data
protection I'm going to click accept
once I accept I'm going to be able to
get some tracking code the tracking ID
is the ID associated with your account
and and so this number is going to be
associated with your account so your
account ID starts with UA and it's going
to be this number here now the dash one
is the property you set up so in this
case I set up demo. simplylearn decom if
I wanted to track multiple websites
under that same account then I can
certainly set up multiple properties
just know that every property I set up
in that account is going to have a d
1-2-3-4 Etc depending on how many
properties I set up so by default I set
up one property so my first property ID
is -1 if I set up a second property the
same account number it's just going to
have a-h two and that's important
because that ID that account and
property ID is going to be associated
with that particular property or website
so again once you finish setting up the
account settings then you're going to be
asked to add some tracking code to your
site and that tracking code is going to
be related to the account and the
property so notice my tracking ID up
here notice the tracking ID in the
snippet of code now this snippet of code
needs to go on every page of your
website that you want to track and you
don't have to put it on every page but
if you want to track website behavior on
every page or website then it needs to
go on every page of your website so if
you're using a you know platform like
Drupal or jumo or even more popular
platform like WordPress adding the
tracking code sitewide is as easy as
maybe adding a Google analex plugin to
Wordpress for example and then just
simply plugging in the ID now there's an
alternative to adding the Google
analytics tracking code to your site and
that's Google tag manager so Google tag
manager is the way I would recommend
going so if you're not familiar with
Google tag manager I would recommend
watching the YouTube video we have on
Google tag manager you can just go to
YouTube Type in simply learn Google tag
manager and this will give you a nice
overview of you what Google tag manager
is and how it works but basically this
is the way I would go and I would
recommend that in addition to having
Google analytics you set up a Google tag
manager account and then that way you
can put the tracking code in Google tag
manager so if I go to Google tag manager
and I just go into an account on tag
manager I can just simply put in the
Google analytics ID right into tag
manager and so if I have it in tag
manager then tag manager is going to be
the place that holds the code and fires
page view when somebody comes to my
website so that way I don't have to add
the tracking code to my website if I do
it in tag manager so that's the
recommended method for me is to add the
Google analytics ID associate it with
tag manager if you can associate it with
tag manager then that's the easier route
to go versus putting code on your
website okay so again take a look at the
video we have on YouTube for Google tag
manager that's the route I would go now
once you do get the tracking code on
your website whether that be through
Google tag manager or through a Plugin
or you know just simply adding the
script to your site to pages on your
site then what's going to happen is
you're going to start collecting data so
that's ideally the way it works you need
to add this code to your website now if
you're not ready to do that and you
simply want to basically understand how
Google analytics works then I would
recommend getting access to Google
analytics demo account and so if you
just type in and search Google analytics
demo account basically what you're going
to do you're going to choose the first
listing there and you're going to go to
demo account so if you have a Google
analytics or Google login then all you
need to do is click on access demo
account and so what Google's going to do
is put this demo account into your
account and so it's going to look
something like this if I click on demo
account here it's going to add to my
Google analytics account so I'm going to
have then access to the demo account
from Google in Google analytics so I
would recommend going this route here if
you're not familiar or you're not sure
what you're getting yourself into so
think of the demo account is kind of a
test drive you're test driving Google
analytics before you even add any code
to your website so again all you need is
a Google account and if you have a
Google account and you add the demo
account to your Google Google analytics
account you're going to be able to see
how analytics works okay and so that's
what I would also recommend so if you're
not ready to start adding code to your
website then what you can do is just
simply add the demo account and then
once you add the demo account you're
free to peruse around Google analyics to
see the different types of reports it
has to offer now when you do actually
set up a Google analytics account you're
going to have some settings that you're
going to want to pay attention to so
when you set up the account you have the
account name and then you have a
property so under each property you have
by default you're going to have one View
and so here you can see this view here
so if we look at the account we set up
we set up a demo simply learn account
property is demo simply learn so that's
associated with the website we're going
to track and then again by default under
each property you're going to have a
view and so by default the name of The
View is going to be called all website
data and so in that view is where all
your analytics data is going to be
stored so you can see my screen here
there's a lot of different settings you
have you have settings under the account
you have settings under the property and
you have settings under the view so
we're going to talk more about these
settings in future webinars for advanced
Google analytics users but for now know
that there's a bunch of settings that
you have that you play around with when
it comes to Google analytics anything
from adding users to your Google
analytics account your Google analytics
property or view you can actually set up
goals you can set up filters you can set
up segments you can link up Google ads
you can you know set up remarketing list
there's a lot you can do in terms of the
settings as it relates to Google
analytics but so know those settings are
there they're located right down here in
this little sprocket icon that's the
admin icon so if you need to get to
these settings at any time you could
simply just click on the sprocket or the
admin icon and then you'll be prompted
to choose any one of these settings here
that you want to edit or alter so now
let's take a look at some Google
analytics reports so once you've
actually set up your account you have a
number of different reports that you
have available to you in Google
analytics so we're going to take a look
at you know C customiz reports we're
going to look at real time audience
reports acquisition behavior and
conversion so these are all the
different reporting buckets if you will
that you have available to you in Google
analytics so if I'm in admin and I'm
looking at the Google demo account let's
start out by looking at real time so if
I click on the real time report and I
just click on overview so basically what
this is going to do is show me me at
this point in time how many users I
actually have active on the website okay
so that's why they call it realtime
reporting because it allows you to see
the behavior of users who are currently
on your website and so this is the
overview report under real time and you
can see here I can see that
79% of my users are coming from desktop
18% 20% are coming from mobile and then
approximately 3% are coming from tablet
here I can see how they actually came to
the website so this is the referring
Source if they came from say search or
social I can see the source there and I
can see what pages they're active on and
then here I can see what locations where
they're located and so if I want to see
a breakdown of everything in the
overview I can certainly do that if I go
to locations under real time I can see a
majority of my users are coming from the
United States okay where are they coming
from from I'll just click on traffic
sources and here I could see the
different sources and mediums medium is
the means in which the traffic was
driven so if it's Google it's either
paid search or organic search so I can
see here it's organic then I can
actually see what content they're
looking at on my website so I can see
currently I have three active users on
the homepage two active users on the
Google's women's white te page so forth
and so on now most importantly if you
have a event tracking set up so if you
taking a look at our Google tag manager
webinar you know that you could set up
event tracking in Google analytics to
measure engagement on your website
whether that be a form submission or
somebody clicking on the play button of
a video so if I click on events I'll be
able to see what events are firing so
here I can see we have event tracking
set up and I can see how many different
events are firing on my website in real
time so here I can see e-commerce
somebody clicking on the quick view
click some you a couple of users
clicking on add to cart a couple of
users clicking on the promotion click
and as these events are fired you're
going to be able to see them highlighted
so if something gets fired it's going to
get highlighted and I could see that
these are the current events that I have
currently firing on the website and
that's what's currently now if I want to
look at the events that have happened in
the last 30 minutes I can just click on
this link here last 30 minutes and it's
going to give me an overview of the
events that have happened over the past
30 minutes okay so that's event tracking
and then more importantly we can also
look at what conversions are happening
in real time just by clicking on
conversions and so now I can see I had
one active user who entered the checkout
so that's goal number four so in
analytics you can have up to 20 goals
and so here I can see we have goal
number four has already had one active
user and so if I look at the last 30
minutes I can see I still have only one
goal over the last 30 minutes and that
was somebody who entered the checkout so
that's real time reporting in summary it
just gives you an idea of what's
currently happening on your website and
so for me ideally if I'm launching a
campaign or let's just say you do a new
website redesign and you want to see how
users performing and behaving then real
time's a good option for you so you
could see how things are happening in
real time now let's jump down to
audience reporting so if I click on
audience if is just right underneath
real time I'm going to see a number of
different reports available to me under
audience and so let's click on the
audience overview report so audience
reporting basically allows us to get a
sense of who is coming to our website
when I say who is coming to our website
it doesn't necessar have to be a
specific person in fact Google doesn't
allow personally identifiable
information in Google analytics personal
identifiable information such as a
specific name uh social security number
credit card information Etc however we
could still paint a nice picture on who
is coming to our website meaning what
country city or state did they come from
what language what device did they get
to our website from how old were they
okay were they male or female or other
what interest did they have what browser
did they use so we can paint a nice
picture based on all this information
that Google analytics is providing us
under audience so if I go to audience
overview here I can see I have all these
different options available to me to get
a basic understanding of who is coming
to our website so for example I could
see a majority of the people coming to
our website speak English and are from
the United States okay in fact that
represents 61% of the users and so
Google analytics does a great job of
giving me an overall percentage so if I
have a 100% of the users I could see 61%
of those users represented
English-speaking users from the United
States 7% represented English-speaking
users from Great Britain and so when it
comes to analytics we have users and
users are broken down into two
categories they're either returning or
they're new so when you add the Google
analytics tracking script to your
website what's going to happen is if a
user or when a user goes to your website
they're going to get cookied and if it's
the first time they've been to your
website what Google analytics is going
to do is store a cookie in the browser
so when that same user comes back
another day in the same browser
analytics is going to recognize that
that cookie is in the browser and so
then analytics is going to categorize
that user as a returning user okay so
that's how analytics is able to
differentiate new versus returning so if
that user doesn't have a cookie in the
browser then analytics is going to
recognize that store the cookie and then
count that user as a new user and so
when you're looking in analytics you're
going to be able to see a breakdown of
new versus returning so here I can see
over 3/4 of my traffic over the past
week here I can see April 6th through
April 12th three over 3/4 are new users
to the website here I could see about 23
24% are returning users okay so I can
get a good breakdown of what type of
users are coming am I driving new
traffic am I driving
traffic that's been to my website before
what language are they speaking okay I
can also paint a bigger picture how old
are they are they what gender are they
do they come from mobile so let's take a
look at some of these different reports
under audience so if I skip down now to
demographics I can click on overview and
when that report loads I can see now
under demographics overview I can see
the breakout of age ranges and so here I
can can see the majority of the traffic
coming to my site again over the past
week now if I want to change this date
range I could simply do that I can
change the date range just by clicking
on the date range and then maybe going
say the last 30 days and I can even
compare it to the previous period or the
previous year I'm going to choose the
last 30 days I'm going to click apply
now I'm looking at data over the last 30
days and again you can change the date
range to any range you want you you can
only go back as far as when you actually
created the Google analytics account you
can't go prior to that so here I'm
looking at the last 30 days and I can
see almost
47% of my users were in their age range
of 25 to 34 now when it comes to gender
I can see
66% represent males so I can get a
breakout of gender and age as well as
interest and click on interest and look
at the overview there and see what the
interest is of the users who are coming
to my site based on in market segments
or Affinity I can also choose language
and location so if I want to know
exactly where my users are located when
they're coming to my website I can click
on location and here I can get a
breakout 43% of the users of the last 30
days were from the United States more
importantly I can align my audience with
goals and we'll talk about goals here in
a minute but here I can see if I have an
e-commerce website I can see of those
43% 29% of those converted or purchased
something and that equates to 94
transactions so I can get a good sense
of not only how many users are coming
from a specific country but are those
users converting if I click on mobile
and mobile to me is one of those report
I tend to spend a bit of time on cuz I
want to know what devices users are
coming to my website and so for my
website here or this is the Google demo
website I can see mobile represents
approximately
27% of the traffic so desktop still
represents a majority of the traffic so
for you you want to keep an eye on
mobile because mobile is definitely a
majority of what people use nowadays
that's how people start their day that's
how they transact Via Mobile whether
that's purchasing something
communicating or searching it all starts
with mobile so you want to keep an eye
on mobile and more importantly you want
to keep an eye on Behavior so Google
analytics is telling me that yes I have
approximately 27% of my traffic of the
last 30 days came from mobile how are
they interacting with my website so if I
look AC across this report I'm going to
be able to see different metrics so if
I'm measuring specific metrics against
my dimension in this case the dimension
is what we're measuring and in this
example we're measuring mobile I can see
that the bounce rate is approximately
48% and bounce rate means that if a user
in this case for mobile landed on a page
they left the site without going any
further so they consider it a bounce if
they don't go to another page if they
leave the site from the page they landed
on and they don't go any further that's
considered a balce so a balance rate is
the percentage of people who come to the
site and leave the site without going
any further so in this case we have 48%
bounce rate that's almost half of our
users who come from mobile leave the
website from the page they landed on so
is that good is that bad well it's open
to interpretation is definitely
subjective but you want to keep the
bounce rate as low as possible you want
to keep people on your site especially
if you have an e-commerce website you
want people who come to your website to
purchase and so here we can see 48%
Mobile in desktop it's a little bit
lower at 41% now if I look little bit
further at engagement I can see how many
pages on average do mobile users look at
so versus desktop it's a little bit
lower you can see 3.86 on desktop it's
4.5 now if I look a little bit further
in engagement I want to be able to
measure how long somebody from mobile
stays on the website if they're bouncing
at 48% but they're also looking at 3.8
Pages 3.9 almost four pages per session
then that means in this report analytics
is tell me they're spending about 2
minutes on the site and interestingly
enough I can see that mobile over the
last 30 days had more transaction so 51
transactions versus 34 transactions from
desktop and interestingly enough the
e-commerce conversion rate is at 29%
that's higher than desktop at 07 it's
lower than tablet but it's higher than
desktop and mobile has the most
transactions and since they have the
most transaction
they have the most Revenue at
2380 so yes the engagement isn't exactly
as great as it is his desktop but we can
see that people are still purchasing
with their mobile devices so it's
something to keep an eye on and mobile
is something I definitely look at in
fact since it's such an important report
one thing you can do in analytics is if
you actually like a report and you think
you're going to look at that report
multiple times then you can simply just
just go ahead and click save at the top
here so if I click save I'm going to
enter a name for this report I'm just
going to call it mobile report and click
okay and then what's going to happen is
it's going to be located under save
reports and save reports is located
under customization customization is
located above real time okay so if I
close that up you can see audience real
time customization if I click on
customization if I click on Save reports
I should be able to see my save report
here and I do so here I can see mobile
report if I click on it I can simply go
to the report I was looking at before I
saved it so save reports to me is a good
feature in analytics cuz it allows you
to quickly access a report that you've
saved in the past so let's take a look
at one more report under audience and
let's go to benchmarking so remember
when we were setting up our analytics
account we had the option to opt into
benchmarking and I recommended you do so
and so if you did actually opt into
benchmarking then you're going to be
able to see how your site compares to
others in the same industry so if I
click on benchmarking and then click on
channels what I'm actually able to do
now is compare my website with others in
the same industry so if I go back to say
jobs and education and I choose educ
ucation all education as my industry
vertical I should be able to see
websites that are in the same particular
industry and how I compare with those
websites so I'm choosing all countries I
can narrow that down if I wanted to I
can just search for the United States I
can choose a specific State and then I
can choose a particular site size so
here I'm choosing sites by daily session
so these are sites that have an average
of 5,000 to almost 10,000 sessions a day
and so in this vertical education in the
United States sites that have 5,000 to
99,999 sessions per day that means that
there are approximately 310 web
properties contributing to this report
okay based on this criteria I chose now
if my S is similar meaning if I'm in the
United States if I'm in education and
I'm receiving 5,000 to 9,000 999
sessions per day then I'm able to
compare my site against 310 other
websites now Google's sharing this data
anonymously from the other websites and
they're doing the same with your website
to those particular websites
benchmarking reports okay so it's shared
data anonymously in particular
Industries and verticals and so now I'm
looking at a channel report so if I want
to see how I compare to others in my
industry then I can go ahead and see by
channel for example am I driving as much
traffic as others in my industry and you
could see I'm not in fact I'm 76
77% worse in terms of the amount of
traffic being driven from organic search
so anything in red is going to show as a
negative result a negative comparison
whereas something in green is a positive
comparison so if I look at engagement I
can see that I might not be driving as
much traffic but I can see that the
pages pression are better than the site
average or the industry average I can
see if I go over again looking just at
organic search I can see the bounce rate
is better than the industry average so
the channel report under benchmarking
allows you to measure how you compare to
others in your industry and you could do
so by looking at location and devices so
if you opted into benchmarking when you
set up your account then you'll be able
to compare your website against others
in your industry in your country region
and based on the size of your website in
terms of how many visitors or sessions
you're getting per day so let's go from
audience to acquisition so if audience
is who is coming to your website
acquisition allows us to see how the
traffic was driven to your website so
how do these users get to our website
and so under acquisition if we click on
overview we'll be able to see an
overview of how users whether they're
returning or new came to our website and
so what analytics does by default is
they have a number of default channels
and when we say channels we mean
analytics is grouping different channels
based on how users got to your website
meaning how did users get to our website
did they come via organic search meaning
did they typee something into Google and
find you in the organic listing
analytics also groups users based on
whether they came to your site directly
meaning did they type in the URL
directly into the browser or did they
bookmark your website and come back via
the bookmark so they're grouping users
under direct they also group users under
referral meaning do they come from
another website they group users by
social do they come from a social media
platform like Twitter or Facebook if
you're running paid search meaning if
you're running paid search on say Google
then do they come from Paid search ads
now if you're running display ads on say
Google's Network Google's Display
Network that's a default channel so
analytics Will Group users there so if
they don't recognize a channel then
they're going to group it as others so
by default Google analytics groups users
on how they came to your website via
these defa default channels and so I can
see how many users came to the site from
each Channel now if I want to drill down
on this report I can click on all
traffic and then if I click on all
traffic I can go to channels I can look
specifically at the channels report and
so now I can see organic search again
over the last 30 days is the number one
channel driving traffic and they
represent approximately again you can
see this number here in parentheses next
to the raw number of users I can see
that number is about
56% so 56% of my traffic over the last
30 days came from organic search and so
those are the number of users again as a
metric you're also going to have
sessions and you'll see sessions a lot
as a metric so users are broken down
between new and returning so every time
a new or returning user comes to the
website basically what they're doing is
initiating a session so you can have a
user who can come back multiple times
every time they come back to the website
it's a session so session is simply the
start of somebody coming to your website
and the session ends when they leave the
website and so just like we looked at
with the audience reports when it came
to mobile we can also look at engagement
by channel so just like mobile we looked
at balance rate pages per session
average session duration we can do the
same thing here with our Channel report
more importantly in addition to behavior
we can see conversions and since we're
running an e-commerce platform we could
see what the conversion rate is by
channel so organic search did drive the
most traffic and they did have the most
transactions over the last 30 days and
the conversion rate in this case is17
okay so how Google determines the
conversion rate they basically take the
number of transactions and divide that
by sessions so that means that over the
last 30 days organic search drove 38,1
123 sessions and of those
38123 64 actually turned into a
transaction which equates
to17 which also equates to 3,000 in
Revenue so I'm able to determine not
only how users are getting to my website
by looking at the channel report I can
actually see if they're engaging and if
they are converting and notice when you
look at a report in analytics you can
look at it by Channel you'll also get a
summary so here I can see a summary or a
total based on my date range so I can
see over the last 30 days I've had
54,000 users
49,000 of them were new okay that meant
that out those 4 54,000 users I had
70,000 sessions I can see my average
bounce rate was 43% the pages per
session were just over four and the
average session duration how long did
somebody stay on my website on average
about 2 minutes and 55 seconds the
average conversion rate was .14 and at a
total of 97 transactions totaling
$5,500 okay and that's all over the last
30 days so any report you look at in
analytics is going to have a summary and
note that any report you look at in
analytics is going to allow you to save
it so if it's a report you think you're
going to go back and look at at a future
date then you simply just have to click
on the save button conversely if you
don't want to save it you can simply
just export it so you can export it as a
PDF if I click on PDF it's going to
allow me to export that as a PDF now you
have other options available to you as
well you can do a Google sheet you can
export it as an Excel or you can export
it as a common The Limited file so here
you can see I can save it as a PDF if I
want to and if I click okay it's going
to save to my desktop or location of my
choosing and then I can go back and look
at it in that format at a later time so
that's the export feature available to
you in analytics again if you you could
save it as well or you can export it
okay okay some other reports under
acquisition if you're running Google ads
note that you can connect Google ads to
analytics and this is key because now I
can see how many people are coming from
Google ads to my website and are they
converting now this is important because
with Google ads I'm actually paying for
the click so you can see here I'm
running a report based on campaign data
so I could see what campaigns are
driving traffic how much I'm paying per
click and you can see on average I'm
paying 34 cents per click and then more
importantly I want to be able to see if
they're converting so you can see I've
spent
$810 over the last 30 days and received
$858 in Revenue so you want to make sure
that you link up your Google ads account
to your Google analytics account for
this very reason you want to be able to
see how your Google ads campaigns
perform once the users get to your
website and so I want to see if they're
engaging and I want to see if they're
converting so there are all sorts of
reports under Google ads so you can look
at it by keywords by search queries by
hour of the day if you're running
display campaigns you can look at
display targeting so there's all sorts
of reports under Google ads you just
have to link it up and you link it up
under the admin now there are other
reports that you can look at so if I go
to campaigns I can look at all campaigns
so if you're running all sorts of
different types of campaigns whether
that be on Facebook whether that be
email whether that be you know other
types of advertising let's just say
Twitter or Instagram you're going to be
able to see those campaigns here and
that's under all campaigns and again
you'll be able to see the campaign name
and you'll be able to see metrics
associated with those campaigns and more
importantly you'll be able to see your
e-commerce if you're running e-commerce
platform or if you have goals set up so
you'll be able to look at how your
campaigns are not one not only driving
traffic but two are they converting
let's go from acquisition reporting to
behavior so Behavior reports are going
to actually show you how users behaved
once they got to your website once they
landed on a page on your website how to
they behave so when we looked at
audience we got a sense of who is coming
with acquisition we get a sense of how
the traffic got to our website did they
come from organic direct social Etc the
behavior reports allow us to actually
measure how that traffic behaved once
they landed on a page on our website and
so if I go to overview under Behavior
now I'm looking at this graph here it's
showing me how many pagu I've had and a
page is simply once a page is viewed
it's counted as a page view so if a user
comes to my site they're initiating a
session and if they look at a page then
that page is going to have a page view
okay so a user can look at a page
multiple times in a session and every
time they look at that page it's going
to count as a page view so here I can
see in this graph how many page views
I've had again over the last 30 days and
if I look further at my overview report
I can see the specific pages and how
many pag they've had and I can also look
at some other metrics okay the average
balance rate the average time on page I
can look at the exit rate which means
how many people actually exited or the
percentage of people who exited from
that page so I can dig deeper into my
behavior reporting so if I click on site
content and I click on all pages then
I'm going to look at a report by Page
this is my demain mention this is what
I'm measuring my page and now I can see
how many page views each page had over
the last 30 days now Noe you also have
something called unique page views so
unique page views is equivalent to one
per session in other words if a user
came to my site and looked at the
homepage then the homepage is going to
have one unique page view and one page
view now if the user in that same
session looks at other Pages then every
page that user looks at it's going to
have one unique page view however if the
user goes back to to the same page in
the same session then it's still going
to be one unique page view but in this
case the homepage if they look at the
homepage a second time then the homepage
is going to have two page views if they
look at the homepage five times in one
session then the homepage is going to
have five total page views and one
unique page view okay so that's why
unique pages is equivalent to one per
where page views is a accumulation of
how many times the page was viewed in
the same session so in other words
you're always going to have more page
views than unique page views okay so
this gives me a sense of how my page is
performed so again I can look at total
page views and then engagement so
ideally what you want to do with a
report like this is if a users not
engaging on the page then that should
tell you something about the page itself
if they're not engaged if the bounce
rate's high if the time on page is low
if the exit percentage of exit rate is
high then you probably want to do
something with that page now these are
all pages but if I jump down to landing
pages my landing page report is showing
me how many people actually landed on
that page and so here I can see under my
landing page report I can see the
homepage had
36,7 sessions in the last 30 days that's
how many people landed on the homepage
so here I can see 71% were news sessions
meaning that I had a lot of new users
who landed on the homepage in fact
25,000 or
52% of the people who landed on the
homepage were new I could see the bounce
rates up about 42% but of those who
didn't bounce they went on to look at
about 4.5 pages per session and spend
about 3 minutes on the site and and the
one thing I like about the landing page
report is I can also see whether that
particular page in this case the
homepage did it help contribute to a
goal or conversion and in this case I
can see of those 36,000 sessions I hit
22 transactions totaling 1,200 in
revenue and that's an e-commerce
conversion rate of 0 6% so the homepage
over the last 30 days contributed to 0
6% of the revenue so this gives you an
idea of when somebody lands on your
website and they land on a page is that
page helping to move that person along
meaning are they not bouncing and is
that page helping to move people towards
converting and so that's what the
landing page in effect allows us to
measure is the engagement and in this
case we're measuring transactions okay
so analytics also gives us some other
reports under Behavior including sight
speed so sight speed to me is an
important report to look at just like
the mobile report to me sight speed's
important because what Google analytics
does is they take a sampling of pages
and in this case you can see over the
last 30 days they sampled
2835 page views and of that sample they
came back and said the average page load
time is about 4 seconds now ideally you
want to keep it as quick as possible I
would say even under 3 seconds okay now
there are other factors involved with
page load time the browser you're using
the country that you actually browsing
that page from mind not how to have the
best infrastructure you may may not even
be on the best internet Network meaning
you're on a cell network or the Wi-Fi is
not that great or you can be on a page
that just has a lot of images or a lot
of code that may slow it down so there
are other factors involved and so what
Google analytics does is show you what
those factors are so here I can see by
browser what the average low time is if
I want to look at Country I could see
what country is contributing to the low
time now the great thing about the site
speed report is if I go to speed
suggestions okay what speed suggestions
is going to do is it's going to show me
the page load Time by Page and then it's
actually going to provide a link where I
can actually click on to get suggestions
on increasing the page load time so for
example I can look at this particular
page here this Google redesign shop
bybrand yoube page line number five if I
look at line number five I can see the
average load time of this page is 8
seconds almost 9 seconds okay that's an
eternity to some people now notice this
link next to it so Google's recommending
seven total suggestions so if I click on
seven total what it's actually going to
do it's going to open up a new window
and it's going to open up another Google
report called page speed insights and
Page speed insights is going to give me
some information about what I can do to
create cor correct the page load of that
particular page so look at this sight
speed report it's important because
there is a correlation between sight
speed or p page load time and user
behavior of that page and there's also
correlation between page load time and a
page ranking organically on search so
page loow time is very important it's so
important that I'm even going to save it
so I'm going to click save and click on
speed site speed suggestions as my name
and click okay and now that report is
going to be saved under customization
under save reports let's jump from
Behavior to conversions now conversion
reporting is arguably the most important
section in Google analytics because what
the conversions reporting allows us to
do is see how people are converting or
if they're not converting on our website
and so in Google analytics we have the
opportunity to set up goals now you have
the opportunity to set up 20 goals in
your Google analytics View and so to set
up a goal okay so you're going to click
on admin and Under The View you're going
to see goals and so if you don't even
have goals the first step is to create
goals and so you have four different
goal types in analytics so you have
pages per session so how many pages per
session is so if your goal is set to say
three or two if somebody actually looked
at two or three pages per session it's
going to count as a goal okay so if I
look here I can see I have pages per
session set at 10 so that means that if
a user came to the site looked at more
than 10 pages per session then it's
going to count as a goal another goal
type is destination so destination means
that if somebody actually went to a
specific page then it's going to count
as a goal and in this case I can see
here that the goal is set to this
particular page here and so when
somebody actually lands on that page
it's going to count as a goal now there
are two other goal types we can look at
one is duration so just like pages per
session in our previous example if
somebody looked at 10 pages per session
it's going to count as a goal with
duration it's based on time so in this
particular case if you set up a duration
goal and the duration is set to say 1
minute and 30 seconds then that means if
a user comes to my website and they
spend at least 1 minute and 30 seconds
then it's going to count as a go goal
okay and then the fourth type of goal in
Google analytics is an event based goal
so when you set up event tracking you
could turn that event into a goal so if
somebody clicks on say the submit button
of a form you can turn that event into a
goal so here you could see the category
equals contact form so you can always
verify if a goal works just by clicking
on verify this goal and in this case
this event is turned into a goal so
anytime somebody fires this event it's
going to count as a goal so you have
four different goal types in Google
analytics you have pages per session
destination event and duration and so
once you've set up a goal then you can
measure goals under conversions so now
if I look at goals overview I can be
able to see how many total goal
completions I've had so if I want to
look at it by goal I can just choose the
goal option here so if I want to look at
for example goal 2 engaged users this
was the pages per session I can see that
I had a conversion rate of 10% meaning
that I had
7,000 of all the users who came to the
website 7,000 goal completions meaning
7,16 users looked at 10 pages or more on
my website and so that's how you want to
be able to measure whether users we they
ever they're coming from whoever they
are whatever Pages they look at you want
to be able to look at the conversion
reports to see if they're actually
converting based on the goals you've set
up whether that's pages per session
duration destination or event goal
conversion tracking reports can help you
measure who is actually converting and
then the great thing about Google
analytics here is that I can actually
see by segment so the default segment
and segment is just looking at a
specific user set so the default segment
is always all users however I can choose
a different segment so if I want to
choose instead of all users if I want to
choose Mobile Traffic I can select
Mobile Traffic hit apply so I'm actually
now looking at a subset of data I'm
looking at mobile traffic so if all the
mobile users who've came to my site I
can see 1,400 engaged P or looked at 10
pages or more okay and that's a 7%
conversion rate so the great thing about
Google analytics is you have the
opportunity to set up four different
goal types okay based on those goal
types you can go to goals overview and
look at the conversion rate of each goal
but you can also change the segment of
that particular goal to see who exactly
converted okay another report I like
under conversions is the multi-channel
funnel report so if I click on Multi
Channel funnel basically what this
allows me to do is see how different
channels work together to convert so
remember the channel reporting we looked
at under acquisition here I can see now
how different channels work together to
drive the conversion so if I look at
three channels direct organic and
referral I can see all three together
Drive 2% of the conversions if I look at
direct and referral 12 1/2% if I look at
direct and organic
12.24% so I can see how different
channels work together and so if I look
at top conversion paths as an example I
can actually see what channels how
channels work together to drive the
conversion so in this example I can see
over the last 30 days that my top
channel grouping was direct times to
meaning that somebody came to the
website directly meaning they typed in
the URL in the browser or they
bookmarked it and came to the site okay
they came the first time but didn't
convert but then they came back a second
time via direct and then converted so
that combination is my top conversion
combination of the last 30 days my
second best conversion grouping is
organic search and direct meaning that a
user came to the website via organic
search first did not convert and then
came back via direct the second time and
converted so basically what analytics
does is give credit to the last referral
meaning if you came to the website via
referral a referring website and
converted then the referring website's
going to get the credit for the
conversion but analytics does a good job
of showing you how different channels
work together so a channel may drive a
lot of traffic like organic search but
that traffic may not convert the first
time around for numbered different
reasons whether it could be brand
recognition Price shopping reading
content whatever the case analytics is
able to measure if that channel actually
did contribute at a later point and in
this case we could see organic search
drove traffic that didn't convert but
that traffic came back a second time via
direct and did convert so that's our
second best Channel grouping and so the
multi- channel funneling report to
conversion pass to me is a good report
to look at so you can actually see not
only how channels work together but you
can see sources and mediums and
campaigns and how all that all those
different campaigns and different
sources work together to convert so
that's just a good report to look at
there are so many different reports
available in analytics there's so many
that we haven't even gotten to yet so my
advice if you look at the demo report
you can get a feel for each of these
reports under each section whether that
be audience acquisition Behavior or
conversions take a look at these reports
see what makes sense to you see what you
can use to improve your website
performance now if you have any comments
or questions about any of the reports we
covered feel free to comment underneath
this video we're definitely going to
have more webinars in the future about
specific analytics settings that we
didn't get to today and other types of
analytics reports and features that we
didn't get to today today in this video
Let's Get To Know in detail about Google
analytics
4 Google analytics is a web analytics
service offered by Google it was
launched back in
2005 it tracks and Reports website
traffic from the information through
Wikipedia Google analytics is the most
used web analytics Service as for the
sources in April 2022
Google analytics was used by
73% of the 10,000 most popular website
across the globe however as per the
reports from built
with.com
281 lakh
52477 live websites use Google
analytics so now is the time to
understand what has been changed in
Google analytics over the years if you
are new to Google Analytics
it's even better before moving forward
do subscribe to Simply learn and hit the
Bell icon to never miss any updates from
Simply learn so what makes Google
analytics so important Google analytics
generates various types of reports and
helps to track bounce rates identify the
best content of your website record user
Behavior flow on your site and many
other
metrics thereby allowing you to
understand and build your business
strategies thereby growing your business
now that you have understood why Google
analytics is essential let's check what
we have for you in this
video first we will understand what is
Google analytics
for then we will move forward with
identifying Google analytics version for
your website next we will have a
detailed look at at Universal analytics
and Google analytics for we will
continue by understanding success
stories from Google analytics for users
and finally we will end this session by
understanding the future of Google
analytics for so allow me to introduce
the next generation of Google
analytics Google analytics 4 also known
as ga4 initially Google analytics 4 was
known as app plus web Google analytics 4
is the latest analytics property with
several advantages over the old Google
analytics also known as universal
analytics understanding more clearly
Google analytics 4 can measure and keep
track of website traffic as well as app
usage so now you can imagine that Google
analytics 4 is the One-Stop solution for
all your analytics needs if you are
still using Universal analytics we
recommend you to get familiar with
Google analytics 4 as
well as this is the new future of
analytics we will understand creating
and setting up Google analytics for
account in detail in the upcoming videos
let's first identify which Google
analytics property is associated with
your
website in order to identify which
Google analytics proper property you
have log into your Google analytics
account now go to analytics
account and then open properties and
apps here you can see properties for
your
website now below the properties and
apps several properties are listed
where you can see different IDs if the
ID starts with UA and ends with a
number then you have a universal
analytics
property however if ID only has
numbers like
here then you have Google analytics for
property we will learn how to switch the
universal analytics account to Google
analytics 4 in the upcoming videos now
that you have understood how to identify
Google analytics property let's take a
detailed look at the comparison of
universal analytics data and Google
analytics 4
data the major difference between
Universal analytics and Google analytics
4 is the measurement model Universal
analytics uses sessions and Page views
as the measurement model whereas Google
analytics 4 uses events and parameters
as a measurement model therefore any hit
type from Universal analytics property
say a page view user timing Etc are
captured as event in Google analytics
for property let's see the detail
comparison of every aspect of universal
analytics and Google analytics
for first we go with
events in analytics every measurable
action for example
page load form completion Scrolls app
installs Etc is measured as event an
event has category label and action in
Universal
analytics moreover it has its own hit
type in case of Google analytics 4 there
is no categorization all the hit types
from Universal analytics are considered
as
events now let's find the comparison of
universal analytics and Google analytics
4 in terms of page views page views is a
metric defined that calculates total
number of pages viewed on your website
now let's get a better understanding of
page views for instance when user lands
on a web page of your site the page
loads this is considered to be a page
view now suppose if user reloads the
page Google analytics tracks it as
another page view if the user navigates
to another page of your website and
returns to the same page this adds
another page view to your site now that
you have understood page views let's see
how page views differs in Universal
analytics and Google analytics for from
Universal Analytics
page view are translated to Google
analytics for property as page view
event this page view event automatically
gets triggered in Google tag
manager the next metric we have is
sessions session is the time duration
for which user is active on your website
a universal analytics session May
consist of multiple pages views events
e-commerce transactions Etc the session
is considered to be ended if the user
has 30 minutes of inactivity or any
other event for which session end is
triggered in Google analytics 4 session
metrics are tracked from session start
event which automatically gets triggered
with the basic interaction on your
website however the session durate
depends on the period between the first
and the last event now let's check our
next metric which is custom
dimension in Universal analytics custom
Dimension add the information to the
collected data whereas in Google
analytics 4 information is added through
the event
parameters moving ahead the next metric
we have is content grouping
content grouping in Universal analytics
allows to group content into a logical
structure after which one can view and
compare metrics by the group name now
talking about Google analytics 4 it has
predefined event parameter for Content
group this parameter fills the data into
content group moving ahead the next
metric we have is client ID client ID is
a unique string generated randomly and
acts as a sorous identifier client ID
identifies the browser instance and then
it gets stored in the browser
cookies and therefore subsequent visits
to the same site are associated with
that user in both Universal analytics
and Google analytics for client ID
serves the same purpose that is the
client ID is responsible for providing
the
identifier now let's move ahead with our
next
metric
parameters parameters are associated
with Google analytics for
properties understanding in detail about
parameters parameters are the chunk of
information that specifies the user
action for example parameters can be
passed to describe the value of the
purchase next we have is user property
user properties provide information like
preferred language a geographical
location of the users that interact with
your website or app now that we have
seen difference between Universal
analytics and Google analytics for
properties the question definitely
arises can Google analytics really
brings success to your
business well if you have a good
understanding of your audience and have
extraordinary strategies to work on the
Google analytics is your best
companion here are some success stories
by Google analytics for users we all
know about McDonald's the leading Fast
Food Corporation with a huge number of
outlets across the globe recently a key
study has been shared by McDonald's Hong
Kong which suggests that the company has
experienced growth in conversions by
550% through the inapp orders and what
made them achieve such a great
growth yes you guessed it right it's
Google analytics 4 let's have a look on
their success story the major goal for
the company was to redesign the strategy
to increase inapp food orders predict
the behavior of inapp audience es and
reach the right customers with
McDonald's mobile order campaigns to
achieve the goals McDonald used a simple
yet smart approach and implemented
Google analytics for properties with the
help of predictive audiences in Google
analytics for properties they tried
converting audiences into
customers moreover with the help of
Google ads they were able to manage the
campaigns as a result of the smart
efforts McDonald was able to gain
increase in conversions by
550% for the users who are likely to
purchase in next 7 days isn't it amazing
moreover for the same audience
McDonald's had noticed a visible
decrease in cost per action by
63% and an increase in Revenue by 560
per. some other companies that have seen
growth in their business through Google
analytics for includes PepsiCo claros
shop Etc with the proven success of top
brands in the world let us know what the
future of Google analytic 4 holds as per
the reports on buil with.com there are
281 l524
77 live websites that are using Google
analytics out of which there are 1 21
lakh
73,4 live websites from USA and 4 lakh
68538 live websites from India who are
using Google analytics if you look in
detail we have a list of big names like
Bank of America blogger.com CIS Co
Netflix
corsera flip cart ICI Bank Tesla India
ictc mintra Etc that are using Google
analytics for their growth however we
are all well aware of the success
stories of all the biggies on the list
thus Google analytics will continue to
be an important part of new business
strategies things you should know before
we end this session are Google analytics
4 will be soon replacing Universal
analytics from 1st July
2023 the universal analytics platform
will be no longer in action however you
will be able to access the reports for
some period of
time Google analytics 4 will be the new
future of analytics the concept of
linking is found AAL to good rankings
and understanding the internet at large
it starts with the premise that good
content will be cited by others
recommending it to other people how we
site and recommend information online is
by linking to it we link to information
that we find
valuable based on that the search
engines assess content by how websites
link to one another so we are going to
cover the definition and purpose of
links and the different functions that
links serve we'll also look at how links
mirror human
judgment we'll look at how search
engines evaluate links by mirroring
human
judgment and how that affects what's
called Block Level
analysis and how where the location of
different links and how they are used
will greatly affect their
relevance we're going to look at how
visitors from different link sources
will behave differently based on where
they came from and also how you can
measure the effectiveness of links and
finally we're going to look at both good
and bad linking practices now links
serve a number of
purposes from a functional standpoint
they usually are our primary means of
navigation online we click on links we
go to different pages and from those
pages we find links to other Pages links
are also a method of citing other
content when we quote somebody when we
use information that we have found
somewhere else we site that information
to give credit to the original author
typically online we do that with a link
so that if someone wants to see the
original Source document it's available
to them that also helps to provide
credibility to you credibility to the
author of the original source as well as
assigning importance to the knowledge
that came from that original source and
the authority of the original
Source links also provide us with a
clear structure of how our websites are
built how the pages relate to one
another and how organized the
information can
be so let's break down the functional
part of a link this is important if
you're going to be developing anchor
text and linking to understand the
structure the
ahre equals is the start of the link tag
what you are doing is developing the
reference of where the document is
contained that's the hre reference is
what it is short
for what comes next within the quotes is
the location of the document now this
can be a full URL or you may just be
linking to to a document that's on the
main roote level of your
server this is the full location where
you can access the document and so
you're putting the name of the document
the extension so that it will be
linked the next part is what I have in
caps you'll notice off to the left I
have something in all blue text and
underline which most people will
recognize as a link you see when it is
in between the
document location in the closing of the
link tag the text you have in there is
what's called anchor text you see
instead of publishing the document
location and the full URL of the
document we can put the link within text
and create anchor text so all someone
has to do is click on the link and the
document loads for them this anchor text
is vitally important to understanding
how we can add additional relevance to
linking
content then we see the closure of the
link
tag this is what makes the internet the
internet is millions of pages connected
together by
Links so when we look at the functional
side of links and we look at this
example here as you can see the title of
this article is not the URL address of
the article it's a title and the title
is the link that is the anchor text of
the link and so from a search engine
standpoint search engines look to see
what words are being used in the link
and how relevant those words are to the
document that is being
linked it also looks to see where is the
link is it in the editorial information
in the article is it part of the
navigation
is it in a sidebar or is it an
ad and then also search engines are
looking to see if this is a text link or
an image
link how long has that link been there
what type of link is it does it go
somewhere within your website does it go
to another website or is it a reciprocal
link which I will explain more later
they also look to see the text in the
link and the context to the page with
the link directs you
to we utilize links a little differently
you see from a human standpoint whenever
we refer information to another person
when we provide reference material to
another person or even if someone asks
us for a recommendation we provide this
information you see offline we mirror
the same behavior as we do online when
we link people ask us for information
and we provide it we just mirror that
online by making a link offline we
recommend we refer we provide
information to each other in much the
same way the way I want you to think
about it from a human standpoint is that
if you asked another person for advice
or directions or a
referral are there certain people that
you would trust more than
others I'm sure the answer to that is
yes and maybe you have some people in
mind that you are thinking about you see
we run across the same issue with search
the search engines know that there are
some websites that are much more
trustworthy than
others just like if you were to ask
someone for information I'm sure you
would ask the right person for the
information you would ask the most
knowledgeable trustworthy person you
knew who had Authority in that subject
area the search engines are trying to do
the same thing with the links that we
publish on our websites they're trying
to determine who is the most trustworthy
and relevant based on the
recommendations referrals and citations
of other websites to other websites who
are the websites that are trusted that
are authorities the search engines are
trying to do from a technical
algorithmic standpoint what we do
naturally from a human
standpoint now from The Human Side as I
had said before we need to think of
links as information that we receive
from other people Word of Mouth advice
information directions
recommendations this is where we need to
think about links not from the
standpoint of building false relevance
for a search engine but being a helpful
resource for our readers how can we help
them how can we provide information and
how can we be a credible source of
information how can we develop our
Authority within the industry and so
that people who have questions about
this content will see our websites as
authoritative and credible
resources the best way to develop links
as you'll see is good content when
people like what they read when they
like what they see when they are willing
to recommend it to others it it's
because you have created something of
value and they'll link to you when they
feel that you are credible and that you
are authoritative with this information
only then will they share it with other
people because you have earned that
right for them to share it with others
by providing content that is informative
educ ucational entertaining and you've
provided that service only then will
people then want to recommend it to
others by linking to
it now links serve a number of benefits
When I look at some of the incoming
links to my site one of the things I
notice is that if I get a link in
certain places that can drive a lot of
brand exposure I can have thousands of
people coming to the site looking to see
an article and that provides a lot of
exposure to a lot of
people however also getting a link from
a certain website especially if it's a
high relevant authoritative website I
can see my rankings increase because of
that but then also a good link is going
to drive people that will convert and
drive sales or leads those who become
customers so those are the three aspect
ects of a good link a good link will
drive traffic to your site a good link
will assist your rankings and a good
link will bring in business if you can
get a link to do all three of those at
the same time that's what I call the
golden link because it has all three
benefits usually however you're going to
find that different links will provide
different types of benefits one of these
three or maybe two out of these three
one of the things I I'm usually very
focused on is the link that drives sales
or generates leads that's getting links
in the right place that will benefit me
tangibly rather than just getting
thousands of people to see
it why it benefits me financially if I
can get a link in the right
place so from here let's break down the
different types of links we have
navigational links we see these in our
navigation our primary navigation maybe
the footer of our web pages where we
have links to typical information such
as about us or contact us we also have
sidebar links this might be related
information or offers or calls to
action and then also I would break it
down into outbound or inbound type of
navigation outbound are links going to
other websites inbound links are links
that come from other websit sites and
that also I might send to other pages on
my own
site now I've used the term editorial
and editorial link is a link that is
found within the content of the website
and by that I mean through an article so
if I am writing an article and I link to
someone else and cite them or reference
them that is what's called an editorial
link it means that it's part of the cont
content a great example of this is that
the navigation on your web pages is not
part of the content it serves a function
as
navigation but it doesn't have anything
to do with supporting information with
citing an authority so information and
links that you put within the content
and presented content of your site are
considered
editorial now there's also call to
action links where you're bringing
someone to a landing page or a
registration page or a sale
page then also we have Social Links now
these can provide a a variety of means
but typically a social link will go to a
profile maybe it's a username that takes
you somewhere else or a comment or maybe
just an image or something that goes to
a social site or that you have placed on
your own site as
well either way it's all contain ConEd
within that social network even though
the links are going on and off your site
they tend to be controlled in that
social
environment now I've used the term
reciprocal link now this
is something very specific a reciprocal
link is one where you would go to
somebody else and you would make a trade
such as if you link to me I'll link to
you and maybe you put those links on the
homepage or maybe you create a page just
for that link you see sometimes it just
doesn't make sense and so the search
engines will see that you've linked to
each other but if there's no contextual
relevance if there's no contextual
relevance most likely you won't get any
benefit because you've agreed to link to
each other for the primary purpose of
boosting rankings now this is not to say
that two websites can't link to each
other because there is some relevance
we'll look at some examples of that
later on in this
module also then we have advertising
links these can be ads banners anything
on the page that is an advertising link
that if you were to click on it you
would go to that advertiser's page those
links are typically through an ad server
and they take place in entirely
different
ecosystem but they are links and we need
to know what kind of links are
advertising and which kind of links are
functional to our
websites now when I broke down the
different types of links so we have our
navigation links we have links in our
sidebar and in our footer what Block
Level analysis does is that the search
engines look at the code of the page
they break down the page because it's
very easy to figure out which part of
the code has to do with your navigation
which part of the code has to do with
your sidebar and your footer and which
part of the code is calling ads from an
ad server what this leaves is the
editorial content your article and the
ability of search engines then to break
down your page into these different
elements the reason why they do it is
that the links contained in the
editorial space are considered to be
more relevant in terms of linking to
other websites than any of the other
types of links on your web page search
engines don't consider all parts of the
page to be equally relevant which is
okay because neither do humans we look
at the navigation as utilization pure
utility because it's just helping me
navigate among the different pages of
your website I'm not expecting to learn
anything I'm using it as a functional
means of navigating your site now your
sidebar might have some calls to action
it might have links to other pages but
it's not an article it's what you've
developed and so it might be a little
more important than your navigation but
it's not as important as what you may
have written within content your footer
navigation is basically the same you
control that it's the same on every page
and so what the search engines are
looking for are the unique content the
unique article or information that
you've published and if there is a link
within the editorial content that is
highly relevant because it has to do
with content it has to do with
information that you are sharing and so
the links there are going to be more
highly relevant and are going to be more
important for the search engines to see
you see it's the same way with humans
we're not going to look at navigation to
learn something it's functional the same
thing with the footer and as humans
we're reading the content that you have
in your article and if you link to
another source well you've provided us
with utility but it's contextual utility
because you're citing where you found
information or you're citing an
additional Source or you are linking to
an example and it enables me as a human
to see that understand it and if I need
that additional information I can click
on it and go to it so I'm going to look
at the information on the page in that
article very differently that I'm going
to look at the headings the navigation
the sidebars or the footer because the
article is what is informing me and so
the links in the article I'm going to
look at very differently and hold them
in a higher level of
relevance now over time search engines
have had to refine the algorithm about
links you see in the early days of
search engine algorithms they used to
Simply count the amount of links then if
one site had more links than another
that made it more credible however once
people started to figure that out people
started accumulating links by by really
any means necessary and they were just
looking for the sheer volume of links
because they knew if they got the most
amount of links it would affect their
rankings and so over the years the
search engines have had to change and
adjust and add more relevance to their
algorithm refine it in order to look at
different aspects of links in order to
properly determine relevance so over
time it wasn't just having a link it was
then also looking at how many people
site this site as an authority so
looking at the source of the link and
the types of pages then also looking at
the text of the link and matching it
with the text of the page does it match
is it contextual and then looking at the
type of Link doing the Block Level
analysis and then also the context the
relevancy of your site compared to the
linking site compared to the link and
the information that's being shared
there also some of the ways that they
can look at it are the age of the link
how long has that link been there humans
do the same thing when we look to see
how long someone has been in business
we're looking at
credibility and then of course there are
many many other ongoing refinements that
are going into the search engines
evaluations of links sometimes the age
of the link isn't as relevant especially
when you're looking for something that
has happened very recently
an Old Link could mean that it's old
news or that something has changed since
then so search engines are in a constant
battle to ensure that people are not
gaming the system by falsely creating
relevance through
linking the link relevancy and the
algorithm is all about trying to
determine who is the most relevant and
credible within this area and that is
the focus of most search engine
algorithm refinements over the past few
years and it will be into the
future now this is where I'm going to
start bringing in some screenshots from
a link Management
program as a search engine Optimizer a
link Management program is probably
going to be one of your best friends as
you move along in this
industry in this example this program
linkex that I'm using will track the
incoming links to my website and it'll
also provide a breakdown as to what type
of website those links are coming from
so I can see how many links I have from
blogs how many links I have from news
sites how many links from wikis how many
links from directories forums social
media public relations sites articles or
additional
resources then I can also add my
competitors and I can compare where I
stand In terms of the amount of links
from each source and where my
competitors stand in this way I can be
sure that we all have a similar link
profile you see if my linking profile
looks vastly different than all my
competitors the search engines are going
to see that as well and know that
something might be different with me
good or bad and that's going to raise a
red flag so I want to look at the
linking profile because every industry
and almost every business's linking
profile is going to be a little
different but especially among
Industries we see that linking profiles
that is the amount of links from
different sources it's going to be
slightly different for every different
type of industry or business so this
helps me understand where my links are
coming from which is vitally important
because from a business standpoint one
thing that I've tracked consistently in
analytics is that people will act
differently and also I can predict which
source is going to send me the best
customers you see just because someone
comes from a link doesn't mean they're
going to buy or become a customer or
really become a lead many times they're
going to come look at your information
and leave and based on how they come to
your site whether it's through a Blog a
directory a forum or a news site has a
lot to do with how they view your
website and it's all about the
context you see this is what I've
learned over the years is that people
will behave differently based on how
they find the
website what I found is that people from
blogs news sites and articles they tend
to stay longer do more and have a higher
chance of conversion of becoming a
customer or a lead the main reason is
because blogs and articles they have a
lot of context it's an article someone
has taken the time to write some
information out and then link to my site
which means there is a highly contextual
reason for someone to click that
link also what it means is that there's
a lot less competition for that link
when my link is in that
article compare that with social news or
any type of social site you see when
you're on a social site and you're
looking at your social stream of
information
there's a lot of different people
competing for your attention a lot of
different things and it's not just in
one subject area it's usually from
multiple subject areas and so the
context is very low because there's a
lot of different types of information
and the competition for your attention
is very high because of that people from
social sites or applications tend to
visit more often but they only tend to
view one page and leave immediately
because they're looking to see what was
interesting and then they move on to the
next
subject that's the difference between
how people react based on where they
come from and so when I'm measuring
links I'm looking to see which links do
I have what's the source and then how do
those sources behave differently from
one another and why you see if I find
that I'm getting links from sources
that people are staying longer doing
more and converting at a higher rate
then I'm going to continue to focus on
building links in those areas because it
directly affects how I monetize my
website so here's a strategy in building
links one of the things I'm looking at
is the source of links like I said if I
can find a link Source that's providing
visitors that will stay look look at my
content engage with the content and
eventually convert and convert at a
higher rate than other sources of
content or
visitors then I'm going to focus on that
source and so I'm going to look at some
high Authority websites whether they're
industry Publications news sites
education sites those are what are
considered high Authority blogs articles
news
sites that's what I'm looking to do I
want to find the most authoritative
website and sometimes it happens
naturally if people that work at those
websites or manage those sites if they
find you and they like your content
they'll link to it and that way you can
get more credibility more
relevancy certain people certain
organizations certain websites have more
Authority and influence than others it
goes back to the question that I asked
you early in this module that how do you
know if someone is more authoritative
than somebody
else we also have mid Authority websites
which you can get some links on and low
Authority websites which are very easy
to get links but here's what I've
learned when it comes to link
building one link from one highquality
website can be worth hundreds or
thousands of mid to lowquality Links
ultimately it's about quality not
quantity
one of the things that I will do
utilizing my link software is look at
the context of the link I want to see
how relevant this is so as I said if I
want to find a high relevant website
what I'm looking for in terms of this is
I want to see the influence of the
domain as well as the relevance of the
domain those are two factors that we're
going to look at when we're evaluating
the quality quality of a domain now as
I'm looking at this report here what
influence means is that it is a high
quality website that within the linking
algorithm these sites have a lot of
authority however they may not be
relevant so for example they may have a
lot of sites attributing authority to
them but they may not be relevant to my
industry which is why we have the next
column of keyword relevance you see when
I'm evaluating my links I'm looking for
the sources that are both influential
and
relevant that means that I've got a link
from a site that fits the two standards
of high Authority it's authoritative and
relevant now it's good to have links
from authoritative sites that might not
be relevant it's still authoritative
ative however to get the full benefit I
want it to be influential and relevant
but not to say that I'm not looking for
links from these other sources this is
just a means of measuring what you have
as well as comparing it to your
competitors and other
websites now here's some best practices
when I'm optimizing anchor text I want
to maintain contextual relevance so so I
want to use text in the text link and I
want to explain to people what they're
linking to what they're going to find
when they click on that link if I use an
image as a link I'm going to use an ALT
attribute because if that image doesn't
show up that
albutein bit of benefit by using that
alt attribute within the image link
I also want to look at the relevance of
the source page that I'm linking to and
make sure contextually the link the link
text and the content of the page is
contextually relevant to the destination
page I also want to be sure that I don't
overuse the keywords that I don't make
multiple links to the same destination
that I don't use the same anchor text
over and over I can be downgraded or
even penalized by the search Eng
algorithm if that is found on my
pages so as an example instead of using
click here for a how-to article I might
use the exact phrase of how to fix
whatever it is and use that as the link
to the page that has the
content that's a simple way of looking
at anchor text am I directing someone to
additional information if I am then how
can I present it to them so they know
exactly what they're going to find and
Link it
appropriately I look at as developing
the next step for your readers where do
you want them to go what do you want
them to do what resources do you have
available to them how can you structure
them so that they're easily understood
and you're explaining the Final
Destination like I said if you overuse
anchor Tech
you can be downgraded or penalized by
the search engines so what I will tell
you to do is number one avoid
overstuffing anchor content that means
needlessly repeating keywords in the
anchor text don't do that avoid being
redundant meaning don't have four or
five or six links with the same anchor
text going to the same page that's a
clear way of letting search engines know
that you're going
overboard don't just randomly Place
links throughout your text just to get
the link ask yourself are you really
helping the reader find the information
they need and do it
once and then also avoid extremely
overly promotional words within the link
text such as best expert cheap number
one those types of things so a couple
examples we can say for travel advice
click here but I would say here is my
travel advice and Link travel advice
rewrite it be
creative if it were easy everyone would
be doing it but this is where you can
write things in a better way to get the
attention of the reader and position it
as a
resource also utilizing your url as the
link or as the anchor text as well for
the link in order to get that click as
I've got it here I would not recommend
that you use that I would recommend that
you avoid
that also the third line to check out
the best website for iPhones and iPhone
accessories utilizing overly promotional
words is one of those ways that you can
easily get caught by the search
engines now for future considerations
when it comes to links
realize that the majority of algorithm
changes are link based evaluation
refinements because people are
constantly attempting to fool the search
engines and develop a false link
profile you should work to create high
quality links with high quality content
I wouldn't chase after Poor or
lowquality
links now as I've mentioned before there
are a number of tools available for you
to manage and measure your backlinks
tools such as linkex MZ Raven Advanced
Link manager Majestic SEO and then also
you can use your Google analytics as
well however Google analytics only shows
you the visitors that have come from
links and what they've done the basic
functions of Link management software
and there are many other types other
than what are listed here but the first
thing that it does is just provide a
catalog of incoming links from other
domains to your site and your competitor
sites they offer tools for comparison to
see which domains are linking to you
what type of link it is and on which
Pages those links are listed they'll
also report newly acquired links in the
past 30 60 90 days or something similar
to that the purpose of Link management
software is to help you as assess
highquality domains versus lowquality
domains in terms of importance and
relevance like I said the first job of a
link management tool is to collect all
of your back links you add your domain
and the tools will usually spider the
domain they'll go out into search
engines and go out into many other
formats in order to find and retrace who
is linking to you what page that link is
contained sometimes what text is on that
page and what text is being used in the
link they will catalog all of your
incoming links organize them format them
and report back to you most of these
link programs provide additional filters
and management tools so that you can get
more insights about who is linking to
you how they are linking to you and the
type of
site personally I use Link decks in
order to Monitor and report on my back
linking so the first report here that
I'm showing out of linkex is that I see
the total amount of incoming links to my
domain this says I have over 2,000 links
and those 2,000 links are on about 1,000
domains on average it looks like I have
about two links from every domain that
is linking to me so this is one way that
you start to look at your links number
one the total amount of domains that are
linking to you and then the total amount
of links available this way you can
isolate domains that are linking to you
consistently and also find those that
may not be the best domains or that are
sending a lot of links that are just not
relevant the next thing I do in
analyzing My Links is to look at the
type of Link meaning the type of site
that it's coming from this report breaks
down the amount of links coming from
blogs news sites directories forums
social sites articles or resources now
it doesn't usually get all of those
links but it does get enough to give you
an idea of how well you're doing in each
channel one of the things that I do like
about this report is it also has a
timeline so I can look and see when new
links have been acquired and maybe when
some links have been just disappeared
that's called churn and it's normal it's
normal because many times a link is
published on social media and it kind of
just goes away or it's not tracked
anymore by your link management software
it can't find it anymore and so linking
is always Dynamic you are always gaining
new links and losing old links there's
going to be a normal amount of
churn the next report shows me all of
the domains that are linking to me it
also shows me in the next column how
many of those domains are also linking
to at least one competitor and it will
list as many competitors of I have
listed in here if they list to multiple
competitors it will let me know the
influence of that site or the authority
that site is seen because of the amount
of websites and credibility that
Authority has for that domain it also
let me know the keyword relevance how
relevant that website is overall
contextually to my domain and the
content that I have it will also let me
know how many pages on that domain have
links to my website so I can also go
through and I can filter this list by
the type of site I can filter by those
domains that are using anchor text to
see how much anchor text is being used
and what type of anchor text there are
many different ways that you can filter
through all of the domains that are
linking to you in order to get an idea
of what's happening on your domain what
are competitors doing and also the
relevance of those links to your
site now when I say that I can add
competitors this is another type of
report very similar to the one I showed
earlier where I look at my own standing
in the different types of sources of
links such as blogs directories forums
and so on I can also when I add my
competitors look to see how how they are
performing in those different areas as
well and so I can compare my link
profile to my
competitors different Industries are
going to have different backlink
profiles they might be more heavily
weighted towards blogs or they might be
more heavily weighted towards forums or
social sites in this way I can look to
see if my competitors are actively link
building and how they're going about it
I can see where maybe they are excelling
in one area that the rest of the
competitors are not so I can compare
different strategies I can also compare
different timelines to see if I am
acquiring Links at a faster rate than my
competitors this is very important if
you are a newer business or a newer
website trying to
compete now specifically what I can do
is look at an individual domain in this
case this domain has three pages linking
to me and that domain also links to two
of my competitors
I can look at the specific pages and
what I'm looking at here are Snippets
this should be familiar to you because
what it's showing is the URL of the page
that's linking to my page it shows me
the page title of that page and then in
this report it lets me know if there are
any keywords being used in the link in
the anchor text as well as the number of
links from that page now what this tells
me is that this is most like Al a
directory something that is listing all
the different places that where you can
buy products because it's most likely
linking to the domain name seeing that
there are no keywords being used in
Anchor text and also that there are 16
outb links from that page that means
that it must be a list of some sort and
they are linking not only to me but most
likely to competitors as well so I can
track my Links at the domain level and
at the page level I can look to see
which Pages might have more influence or
relevance to my content I can also see
the link URL the page title if any
keywords are being used in the anchor
text and also within the context of how
many additional links are leaving from
that page if there are a high amount of
outgoing links on that page then a link
from that page might not be as valuable
since there are so many links the less
links there are coming out from that
page the more it will benefit my site
because I'm getting more benefit from
less
links now also what I'm going to do is
compare the link reports to my analytics
I'm going to go to my analytics because
linking software does not show traffic
it doesn't show how many people are
clicking on the link it only shows who's
linking to you but it does not show
visitor activity and Antics will show
you visitor activity to see which
domains are most effective in sending
visitors to your site you'll go back to
the primary benefits of linking visitors
branding and business analytics show me
visitors and business it shows me which
domains are sending me visitors and
which of those visitors are becoming
customers so what I can do is go to
Google analytics look at all the domains
that are referring traffic to my site I
can also click on the domain and see the
destination page that they are linking
to I can see how many visitors are
coming either monthly or annually how
often they're coming back whether their
new users or repeat users how long they
stay how many pages they View and how
many conversions as a result of those
visits this is a great way to get a 360°
View of your linking because not only do
you want links that will help you rank
better you also want links that will
send business and customers to you as
well building links can take many forms
ideally it is through networks
relationships and marketing that other
websites and users learn about you like
you and recommend you to others
unfortunately there is a lot of bad
outdated and untrustworthy wor the
advice to be found about building links
to your website in this section I'll
present the best practices as accepted
by the omcp
standard the objectives for this module
that you'll be able to develop a link
building strategy that you'll understand
the value of different link types
finally you'll be able to find inbound
link
opportunities the first step in building
links is to evaluate what you have now
there are many tools available that you
can utilize to do this for you there are
automated tools that you can get that
will catalog all of the incoming links
to your website some of them are link
deck MZ Raven or Advanced Link manager
there are many that can do that you may
also want to utilize your analytics as
well in order to find find websites that
link to you the first step is evaluating
where you are right now your incoming
links have a significant impact on your
rankings and you can do a lot of onpage
optimization and see some
results however a lot of Google's
algorithm takes into account links from
other high quality
websites now when you evaluate what you
have in this example I'm showing you a
screenshot from
linkex linkex cataloges the incoming
links to my website and it groups them
into different areas the first way it
groups them is by high value or high
influence
domains those are websites that link to
me that have a lot of influence not
necessarily in my industry but High
influence based on the amount of people
that link to them as an authority on
many different subjects the next way
that it groups that is based on
relevance now this is when it looks at
the match of my content versus the
content of the other website in the
first example we can see the National
Library of Medicine it is a high
influence website because it is a
government website with a lot of
information that is cited frequently
because of the amount of other websites
linking to that site it has a high
amount of
influence now based on the website that
I am
measuring there is a lot of keyword
relevance meaning that that National
Library of Medicine site with the
government has a lot of content that's
very similar to my site a lot of the
same keywords are being used so not only
is this website of high influence it
also has a lot of relevance and that's
key when evaluating my
backlinks I want to look at which
websites are also referring traffic so
while I may have a link from the
National Library of Medicine I went to
look at my analytics and look to see is
it also providing visitors are visitors
following that link to my site and I
also want to look at the quality of
traffic that it produces do these
visitors stay longer than average do
they convert more than average I want to
look at the quality of traffic based on
the
source next I want to look at the
incoming links from those other websites
number one I want to make sure that the
incoming link from the other site is
both accurate and relevant meaning the
text that is used in the link is
accurate to the content that will appear
on the page when the visitor clicks that
link is the content relevant this is
especially relevant if I have updated my
website changed the content or moved
things around I want to be sure that
that incoming link sends visitors to the
appropriate page and the appropriate
information I also want to ensure that
that link is worded correctly that it
uses the right words
that is sending visitors and setting
expectations of the content that they
will
see I may need to contact the website
manager or owner and maybe ask for a
better link text or a more accurate page
destination now this requires some
interaction with the owner or manager of
another website and you always want to
be respectful of their time and not
demanding that they make any changes
in some cases the organization may be so
big you may never find the right person
in order to optimize the text or the
destination of that link you always want
to look for accuracy in cases where your
company or website name is utilized in
the link but also if there is any
contact information such as address
phone number a description of your
business and any content make sure it's
accurate and it all points to the right
place another way to look for links is
to Simply go to a search engine and
start doing searches search for your
company your business your company name
and look for websites that may mention
you but do not have a live link to your
website many times your company will be
mentioned or cited but there will not be
a live link you can only find these
through doing searches and seeing which
websites mention you without linking to
you now this could be an opportunity to
get an Easy Link especially if you can
find some contact information and
finding the right person that could add
a link to your company
information again you'll need to be
polite ask for their help and it will
help it if you can develop the link
along with the link text and send that
over giving them just a quick and easy
edit to be able to add the information
so make it as easy as
possible as an example I've provided a
sample request
format again you want to be polite you
want to be inviting and respectful of
their time and their
management sometimes like I said you may
find the right person that can help you
however the larger the company the more
difficult it will be to make this happen
this just requires your
patience and again being polite and not
expecting the company to do what you are
asking many times this is just a
formality and sometimes companies will
act on it so be sure to approach this
with the right
expectations the next thing I want to
look at are business listings these are
the easy ways to establish links and
ensure that links are where they should
be and also
opportunities look for business
directories especially if your company
has a local presence you can utilize
Chamber of Commerce lists Association
lists or local listings if they are on
websites see if they offer links that
can go to your website rather than just
the list of businesses that are in the
area even on a larger level you can look
for associations directories or listings
where you can add your business or
double check if your business is there
and always ensure that your business
name address phone number and URL are
correct complete and consistent with
other
listings the next level will require
some active marketing and that's where
you search for
opportunities you can go out and look
for other resource lists within your
industry or directories of businesses
within your industry and you can get a
link many times through membership or
submitting your business as a
resource however you may want to step up
your marketing you can do that by
interviewing your clients seeing if they
might be willing to provide a
testimonial and a link to your website
you may also want to go out and find
other communities online maybe some
social communities that are relevant to
your
industry get involved with those
communities fill out a profile and get
involved by contributing information by
sharing information you'll find that
people like getting information and
they'll respond by linking to your
site another option is to utilize the
tool that you had for indexing your
links from the first step you can also
add your competitors and you can look at
their back links you can look and see
which websites and which domains are
linking to your competitors but you
always need to go and see why what are
those other sites linking to and what is
the nature of that
link sometimes it Mak exclude you from
being able to approach competitors
backlinks and ask them for
links however if they're being linked to
by companies that are simply stating
here are vendors in this space and they
are linking your competitors and you're
not there then it might make a lot of
sense for you to approach and ask if you
can be listed as well however be sure
that the links to your competitors are
not from a consumer or customer
relationship in that case it might be
out of line for you to ask for a link
make sure if you approach anyone who's
linking to a competitor and asking for a
link to your site make sure the context
is right and that it makes sense for
them and that's the ultimate judge of
value does it benefit somebody else to
link to your site we all know that it
will benefit you but when you present
your link request you need to offer
value and a benefit from for others to
link to you so be sure that you present
it in a way that is beneficial and good
for those people that will be adding the
link they're the ones that have to take
the work to do it and they're also the
ones that are adding a recommendation
for you and your business so as always
you need to be considerate and
patient now the best way to build links
is by creating something
that people like and sharing it you see
the best way to build links is by
creating value through content or
information or
entertainment you see when people like
things they link to it if they find a
study or a white paper or research that
you performed they link to it if you
post a infographic that explains
something and it's a Attractive people
link to it you see that's what's most
amazing about linking I find that when
we put most of our effort into creating
content that people like that's what
builds the most valuable and the most
relevant links and so what type of
content well you can create infographics
videos top 10 lists or articles articles
with advice or analysis of Market data
or even
research that type of content people
love it and so when you publish it out
you utilize social media to extend the
reach and the visibility of that type of
content and recommend it to
others now people also like depending
upon your industry or your business they
also like some personality maybe some
humor people always like expert
information they like the cute this is
why picture of cats tend to be liked and
linked to more than almost anything else
and also the
unexpected if you can inject any of that
into your content that just makes it
more valuable more personable and again
more sharable by other people and every
time someone shares it it builds a link
to your
site you see the best linking is when
people like something when you create
something that people like and share you
might be surprised at the many
opportunities there are to get links
based on your content I've seen many
many blogs based on cooking fashion Arts
Sports music and when people specialize
within a specific topic they always find
an audience and so anything they publish
builds links even on certain social
media sites such as Pinterest
people upload pictures and articles and
infographics especially about
landscaping flowers food cars you name
it there is a special interest for
anything and you can develop links from
those social sites to your site and it
can generate
traffic even with a Blog developing
articles that talk about upcoming events
new music Sports whatever it is when you
create content that people
like it takes the longest amount of time
to build content for building links when
you develop your own content that's the
biggest investment you'll make in time
and research and writing and
presentation however the result is that
when you develop that content you will
receive the best and highest quality
links and the most valuable links are
are going to be to that content as I
mentioned before one highquality link
can be worth more than hundreds or
thousands of lowquality links so my best
advice is to create content that people
like that they link to and that will be
high value links that you'll generate to
your site Google tag manager thanks for
joining and let's get started with this
simply learn webinar so let's start out
with y GTM so let's just say you're Sam
and you have your own eCommerce website
and you want to understand how people
are interacting with your website well
Sam today's world of websites contain a
lot of interactivity everything from
videos to PDF downloads to commenting to
form
submissions uh to all sorts of chat
functionality interactivity going on
throughout the website so there's just a
lot that you need to track outside of
just page views and so really what GTM
does is they help you track all these
things I just mentioned everything from
somebody clicking on the play button of
a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit
button of a form to somebody entering in
something on a chat function so that's
what GTM is a y GTM because it helps us
track all that interactivity so all GTM
is is really allowing you to really
place a piece of java code which is just
script and this script that's added to a
web page to collect information so
that's really what a tag is it's just
some script that gets put on a web page
in order for you to collect information
like page views clicks Etc and they send
it to third party tools okay so that's
what GTM does it it basically allows you
to take all these tags that collect
information and you can use them in GTM
so if you want to for example collect
how many people you know enter a chat
functionality and start chatting well
you're going to take that script and
you're going to put it in GTM and GTM
will then allow you to start tracking
that information so that's really what
GTM is it just allows you to put tags
into a container or think of it as a toy
box you have all these toys and you want
to track well you can put all those
those toys or tags in a toy box or
container and we're going to talk a
little bit more about that but before we
get into GTM let's just say you know
you're communicating with your developer
and there's a new user request on your
web page and you want to update the tag
well your developer considering it's
probably a small update to your website
is probably going to not um hesitate and
is going to go ahead and turn around and
do it normally
and so normally what happens is the
developer is going to go to the website
and update the tag well what if you have
a few things that you want to track all
these things I mentioned before from
downloads to clicks to you know somebody
checking out to watching a video well
your Web Master your web developer is
going to go well hold on a second now
all these requests are going to take
time I need to put them into the work
que so to speak well what happens is
when they go into work que usually it's
going to take some time and in some
cases you as a marketer need to launch a
campaign and you want to get that
tracking uh added to the website in time
for the campaign launch so you want to
go ahead and quickly turn around the
tracking for that particular campaign
let's just say you're launching a
campaign and you're sending people to a
landing page that has a form submission
and you want to be able to track how
many people click on the submit button
of that form submission well if you need
to turn that around your developer like
well I need to put that in work cu the
timing isn't going to always work out
between you and your developer is my
point and so that's where GTM comes in
because there is a solution update your
tags faster and that's Google tag
manager so when we say GTM that's what
GTM stands for a Google tag manager it's
a place for you to add tags quickly and
easily so tags remember are just
Snippets of code that allow you to track
things on your website interactively
interactiv activity and basically when
you have GTM you can buy past the Web
Master and do it quickly and easily so
that's what GTM is all about so why GTM
because we just identified two benefits
one you could track all the
interactivity on your website and two
you can bypass your web developer or Web
Master and so that's the benefit of GTM
so the benefit you get those tags
updated very quickly via Google tag
manager okay so that's what tag manager
is so what we're going to talk about
today is specifically what tag manager
is and what it does we're going to list
some of the benefits of tag manager
we're going to show you how it works and
then we're going to show you how to get
started with tag manager tag manager if
you're not familiar with working with
web Masters and dealing with JavaScript
and tags and all this jargon is just new
to you today okay well don't fret sit
back we're going to take it slow this is
an introduction into Google tag manager
again let's start out with what is tag
manager so we've already introduced it
to some degree because we already
introduced this as a tool where you can
put all your tags into a toolbox toy box
or container so to speak right and we
already already mentioned that hey you
can bypass your web master so you're
probably thinking well if I'm if you're
not familiar with tag manager how can I
bypass my Web Master well first of all
it's a free tool and it's a Google tool
hence the name Google tag manager and it
helps you really that's the main point
is deploy and track tags on your website
by passing your web master so that's tag
manager and so examples of tags that can
be deployed via Google tag manager are
numerous these are just some examples
like Google analytics Facebook's pixel
tracking or Google ads There's No Limit
into the number of tags you can track in
tag manager there is no limit you can
add any number of tracking tags and tag
manager okay so some of the benefits
well again I we just listed two you can
put any tag into tag manager and track
that onto your website and we know you
can bypass your web developer or Web
Master and what it also does is it also
allows you to test and deploy your
JavaScript codes quicker so remember
these JavaScript codes or Snippets of
codes are just there to track certain
things on your website whether that be a
page view or somebody clicking on a play
button or tracking somebody who converts
or even just goes to your website so the
biggest benefit is you can take that
snippet of code let's just say Facebook
let's just say you're doing Facebook
marketing and you want to put that
Facebook pixel on your website so that
you could track people who come from
Facebook and convert well you don't need
to put that Facebook pixel on your
website you can go right to tag manager
and you can put that snippet of code
right and tag manager really quickly and
the other benefit here is all tags are
managed in one place and that's that to
me is really a good benefit because when
you start adding tags on your website
and you have some tags and tag manager
it just gets very confusing so ideally
all the tracking code you have on your
website needs to be in tag manager think
about that all the tracking so if you're
doing Bing or you're doing Facebook or
you're doing Twitter or you're doing
LinkedIn and you're doing Google you're
doing all this type of marketing on all
these different platforms you're going
to have tracking code for all these
different platforms and instead of
putting on that code on your website
return going to slow down the slow low
time of your web page and website you
want to put them all in tag manager so
they can be organized and you know
exactly what you're trying to track and
the other great benefit of tag manager
is there's a versioning control so let's
just say you have added tags to your
website via GTM for the last 6 months
well and let's just say you add another
tag yesterday if you added that tag
yesterday and something doesn't work
well you can just roll back to a
previous version It's that simple so you
have versioning and that's that's a good
thing when you have versioning you can
control what gets published and if
something doesn't work after it gets
published then you can roll back to a
previous version so it's a a piece of
mind so to speak just because you've had
coach your site there's no guarantee
it's going to work and so you can always
control what version you're dealing with
in tagman manager and we'll talk a
little bit more about that so the
biggest benefit here to me with tag
manager is you have event tracking and
so we talked about some of the things
you could track on your website from
videos from play buttons to somebody
clicking on the stop on the video or
pausing it all the way to somebody again
chatting or let's just say somebody
clicking on that purchase button on your
website okay and you want to track all
these different things these different
interactiv activities and buttons well
event tracking is what you're going to
use to track all those buttons and to me
this is the biggest benefit of tag
manager and I'll show you some examples
as we go along and if we didn't mention
it already I'll mention it again it is
free tag manager is free there's no
limit so once you have tag manager going
you can add as many tracking codes as
you want there's no limit on the number
of tracking codes you can add to tag
manager okay so it's free and you can
use it to its fullest advantage AG okay
so it's also high security meaning that
it has different levels of permissions
okay so you can have a somebody just go
in and look at the different tags and
tracking codes you have in GTM or you
can have somebody who is very familiar
with tag manager it can go in and add
the tracking code to tag manager and
then publish that tracking code when it
gets added so those are all the benefits
let's talk about how it works now
specifically how does tag Manager work
cuz you're like Rob okay again a lot of
jargon you know you got tags and
JavaScript and and versioning and
Publishing and all this other stuff well
I know I'm throwing a lot at you at once
but just bear with me here okay so let's
start talking about how it actually
works so you have a website okay
whatever that domain is you have a
website and there's chances are on your
website you have some form of
interactivity whether that be a video
whether that be a Blog whether it be a
form
you have a website with some
interactivity and let's just say you're
even thinking about getting ready to
launch some type of campaign on maybe
Google or Facebook and you want to drive
traffic to your website fair enough
you're joining the millions of other
websites that are out there that have
interactivity that also Drive traffic to
the website so in comes Google tag
manager and so tag manager is important
because again we know we want to track
people coming from that Facebook
campaign or that Google campaign
interacting with our site so if you are
running Facebook and you are running
Google analytics well guess what you
want to put that tracking code in tag
manager so Google analytics being a
Google product works very nicely with
tag manager Facebook has its own
tracking code and but you still want to
be able to track people who come from
the Facebook campaign to your website so
you're going to get that tracking code
from Facebook and put it in tag manager
that's generally how it works so here
information from your website is sh
shared with another data source through
tag manager so think about that if I add
Facebook tracking code to tag manager or
let's just say I Google analytics
tracking code to tag manager tag manager
is the one that's pushing out and doing
all the heavy lifting they're the ones
that are controlling what code gets
fired and what code doesn't so if you're
putting the code in tag manager tag
manager is controlling the code think
about it that way and let's show you an
example of what that looks like so here
I am I'm in tag manager I just went to
tag manager. goole.com and here I could
see a list of tags so in our
conversation we're talking about
tracking Facebook and we're talking
about tracking Google analytics well
Google analytics is easy because it's a
Google product so here if I look at all
the different tracking code I have on my
website through tag manager let's just
take a look at Google analytics so if
you're going to use Tag manager you
might as well put the Google analytics
code in here so here I can see I have
Google analytics as a tag in tag manager
now for Facebook if I'm running a
Facebook campaign well I can take that
pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well
and here I can see Facebook pixel that
is that code is added to GTM I just
basically took what Facebook gave me and
put it into Google tag manager so you
can see I can add Facebook and Google
analytics and again I can't stress it
enough any tracking code code from any
platform I can add to Google tag manager
in order to track the behavior from
those sources so let's take a little bit
deeper dive into how tag manager works
so I just showed you an example of how
you could take Facebook and Google
analytics code and put it into tag
manager but if you're not familiar with
tag manager then how do I do that well
let's talk about the structure and how
tag manager works so when you have a tag
manager account you have a container
remember I mentioned Toy Box earlier you
have a bunch of toys if they're they're
code and you're tracking different bits
of code from different platforms like
Facebook think of those as toys and you
have a toy box okay well that's what
this code is and that's what a container
is the code is the code and that's going
to go into the toy box or container and
so the way tag manager works is you have
tags triggers and variable so if I take
my Facebook tracking code and put it
into a container I need to set up a tag
and a trigger okay so let's take a look
at what that is so first if I go back to
tag manager I'm going to have an account
and if I have an account I'm going to
have a container so here I'm just going
to click on an account with a container
and a container is nothing more than
what website you're adding the tracking
code to okay that's all the container is
we're just letting tag manager know this
is the website we're adding all this
code to so you have tags triggers and
variables that's the structure of tag
manager so tags are just what it says
tags what do we trying to quote unquote
tag well if it's Google analytics that's
easy here I can see I have Google
analytics added so if I click on Google
analytics here's my tag and if I take a
little bit of a deeper dive there since
Google analytics is a Google product it
integrates already with tag managers
it's pretty easy I can just choose
Google analytics then I'm going to check
page view and that's my tag now every
tag needs a trigger okay so I need to
tell tag manager how or when to fire the
Google analytics tracking code so in
this case I'm going to tell tag manager
to fire on all pages so if I get
somebody a visitor to my website
analytics is firing on all pages so
whatever page that visitor lands on
Google Analytics is going to fire so
that's really what it comes down to is I
have a tag and I need to tell tag
manager when to trigger that tag that's
really what the structure of tag manager
is it's tags triggers and variables and
VAR what we're going to talk about here
in a couple minutes but you have a piece
of code you're going to go ahead and put
that into tag manager you're going to
tag it and then you're going to fire
that trigger so let's take a look at
another example here if I go back here
you can see Facebook well here's my
Facebook pixel okay that's my tag so
when is it going to fire well it's going
to fire on a specific domain or
subdomain that's basically what we're
doing we're trying to tell GTM when to
fire that particular tag so those are
the three main components a tag okay
which is going to contain the JavaScript
code that you get from say Facebook the
trigger so you're going to go into tag
manager and tell tag manager when to
fire that code that's the trigger and
then you have variables and so variables
are basically just additional
information that tag manager may need
for your tag and Trigger to work so
that's what a variable is it's there to
get the tag and Trigger to fire so
variables are divided into builtin and
userdefined variables so common used
variables include say page path or page
URL or host name name or click class
again they're there and these examples I
just gave you are there to get your tag
and Trigger to work think about it that
way there just that's a component and if
I go into tag manager here and here on
the left side I can see variables so
remember I have builtin and user defined
so builtin means that tag manager
already built these for me so in case I
need to get my trigger to work with my
tag I can use use a variable so those
are built in and then I have user
defined so these are what I defin these
are what I created and again the
variables are there to get the tag and
Trigger to work okay so that's the job
of the variable the job of the tag is to
host that JavaScript code okay in the
case of Facebook or analytics that's
where we're putting our code so here if
I click on AdWords remarketing again
it's a Google product so I don't really
need to even deal with code I'm just
going to select Google AdWords REM
marketing okay so you could see GTM
integrates nicely with some of the other
Google products but let's just say you
have a Facebook pixel tracking code
you're going to choose custom and you're
going to put the code here so that's
part of the tag and then the trigger
again is there to get the tag to fire so
you're telling GTM when to fire the tag
and the variable is there to help you
make sure that that trigger and that tag
work together so that's how all three
kind of work together you need the tag
to put the code you need the trigger to
tell GTM when to fire the tag and code
and the variables there to help you
define when that tag and Trigger should
work or how it should work so again
review tags are they're just small codes
of JavaScript are tracking pixels on
your website and so tags are allowed to
manage events like scroll track and
remarketing clicks downloads files play
buttons you name it even clicks on
external links for example let's just
say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh
icon on your site and when somebody
clicks on it they go to Facebook you
want to maybe track that you're going to
create a tag okay the trigger is there
because you need to tell GTM when to
fire that tag so it's a certain
condition whether it's you know fire the
tag if the URL equals facebook.com or
some other condition so the tag cannot
be created until the creation of the
corresponding trigger so tags and
triggers go together you can't just
create a tag and not have a trigger
otherwise your tag will never fire and
then the variable is there again it
stores the information when defining a
trigger or transferring data to tag so a
variable has a variety of data okay so
you pick and choose the variable you
want to use with that trigger okay so
you're making sure that by defining a
variable you're making sure that you're
telling GTM how that trigger should be
fired so let's take a look at another
example here of how all three play
together if I'm in this account I'm in
this container if I look down here I
could see Google optimize that's another
Google product so what I'm doing here is
I just chose Google optimize as my tag
it's already integrated so what does
that mean I don't even need to deal with
any code I'm just going to select
optimize well we have the tag Google
optimize but we need to tell GTM how to
fire that and so here we're going to
tell GTM to fire it on all pages so
that's basically a very simple example
because we're firing it on all pages so
if I want to look at something specific
again Facebook here's my tag here's my
code what's my trigger well my trigger
is it's going to fire on specific Pages
how do I know that well if I look at the
trigger here I could see the trigger is
is a page view but I'm telling it to
fire on this particular host name so the
tag and Trigger go hand in
[Music]
hand so how to get started with tag
manager so first things first you have
to create that account so you're going
to go to tag manager. goole.com or you
can do a search for Google tag manager
and you're going to create your account
and then when you create your account
what's going to happen is you're going
to set up a container and when you set
up a container you have choices so you
could set it up for your website for an
app on iOS or maybe Android or you can
even set it up for an accelerated mobile
page so most people by default are
probably going to set up tag manager for
their website and so when you do that
when you actually select website what's
going to happen is you're going to get
some Google tag manager code in return
and so the whole idea here is you're
going to do a swap what you're doing is
basically you're saying Okay Google I'm
going to take this Google tag manager
code and I'm going to put it on my
website I'm going to put it on every
page of my website so notice tag manager
has two scripts one goes in the head as
high as possible the other goes into the
body tag as high as possible and so what
you're doing is you're making a deal
you're putting this tag manager code on
your website and in return every code
you deal with whether that be Facebook
or analytics or optimize or remarketing
or whatever it is is going to go in GTM
okay it's going to go into the Container
you created so you need the tag manager
code on your website in order for tag
manager to work okay so when you add
this code to your website then you're
free to start adding all sorts of tags
to your container but if you don't have
this tracking code on your website then
none of the tags you add to your
container are going to work so that's
the idea behind the container and then
one thing I wanted to mention on the
account is it's a Google account so when
you create your account then make sure
it's the same account you use with say
Google analytics or some other Google
product that's a good best practice is
always use the same email address when
you set up your account so that it
integrates nicely across all the
different platforms meaning you can go
from say Google analytics right to
Google tag manager and one browser
without having a log out or log in okay
so when you create the account you're
going to create your container if you
choose web then you're going to be asked
to place code on your website and when
you place that code on your website then
you are free to start using tag manager
and that means you're free to start
adding tags so if you want to know more
information about installing Google tag
manager then what I would recommend is
visit the quick start guide website of
GTM so again if you're curious as to
where that code is located in Google tag
manager well when you create an account
and you create a container that
container is going to have a specific ID
so if I click on that specific ID here's
where I can get my code okay so again
when I'm logged in to tag manager I'm
going to click on workspace but in the
top navigation I'm going to see my
unique GTM ID if I click on that that's
where my code is going to be located and
so again your code needs to go in the
header and there's another script that
needs to go in the body and if you're
not sure how to add the code to your
website well you can always click on the
quick start guide here okay and that's
that'll take you to a quick start guide
page a reference page related to Google
tag manager so let's talk about creating
a tag so once you get tag manager
installed I'm sure you're excited to get
going and create that first tag so let's
talk about how to create a tag in tag
manager so when you're in tag manager
all you need to do is basically you're
looking at all your tags if you click on
tag in the left side navig ation you'll
see all your tags and there's a new
button there so you just click new and
so basically what you're going to do is
you're going to create your first tag
and so what I would recommend once you
get tag manager installed on your
website I would recommend setting the
first tag up as Google analytics so that
will get you going with tracking page
views on your website when some when
somebody visits your website okay so
ideally that's what you want to do you
want to get Google analytics as your
first tag and tag manager so what I'm
going to do is because analytics is a
Google product it's already integrated
nicely with tag manager so I'm just
going to click on Google analytics it's
going to be a page view that's what I'm
tracking and now I have to set up a
variable and so what it's going to do
it's going to ask me to set select a
variable and so what you're going to do
is you're going to select new variable
and what you're going to do is you're
actually going to go and add your
tracking ID here that's going to be your
variable so where do I get my tracking
ID in analytics well if I'm in analytics
I'm going to go to admin and then under
property settings I'm going to see my
tracking ID and all you need to do then
is go to tag manager and paste copy
first you got to copy over that tracking
ID then you're going to go to tag
manager and going to paste it and then
that's going to create a variable for
you and then when you create that
variable you're going to see it in the
drop down here so I've already created
it and basically that's your tag with a
variable then what are you going to do
you're going to set up a trigger so see
I have some triggers already set up
you're going to see a default trigger
already set up for you and that's going
to be all pages so ideally what you want
to do is you want to select all pages in
order for analytics to fire on all pages
so that's what we're doing we're setting
up a trigger we're basically telling tag
manager hey if I get a visitor to any
page on my website then I want you to
fire Google analytics so that's
basically in summary how to set up your
first tag and my recommendation is your
first tag should be Google analytics and
when you set up analytics you're going
to have to set up a variable for the
tracking ID and so you get the tracking
ID again from admin property settings
copy and paste that tracking ID over
save it you have your variable that
variable is going to be included in with
the tag then your trigger is going to be
all pages and there you go you have your
first tag you have your first variable
you have your first trigger so that's
basically what you want to do and once
you've added that tag once you've added
that trigger then the only thing you
need to do now is basically publish the
tag and so anytime you save a tag you're
going to go ahead and submit it so that
way it gets published so again what
you're G to do is just take a step back
here you're going to choose new tag
you're going to choose analytics from
the drop-down menu you're going to
choose page view then basically you're
going to add your tracking ID so you
could set up the variable and then
basically that's what you need to do
okay you're going to add that tracking
ID and then VOA that's your tag with a
variable and then once you've done that
then you're going to click submit so
when you click submit you're basically
saying Hey I want this tag to go live
now this tag and Trigger and once you've
done that then analytics is ready to go
and anytime somebody goes to your
website on any page tag manager is going
to fire Google analytics so the great
thing here is you have something called
Google tag assistant and that's an
extension that works with chrome and so
when you've actually added tag manager
to your site or you have analytics
running in tag manager you can confirm
if those tags are firing properly so
let's take a look at how Google tag
assistant works okay so if you just do a
search for Google tag assistant you're
going to see here that it's basically
just an extension that works in Chrome
and unfortunately it only works in
Chrome browser it doesn't work in any
other browser so go ahead and install
that extension into Chrome and when you
do that you're going to see this nice
icon here in your browser and now if you
go to any website and I click on Google
tag assistant and I click on enable Okay
so basically I'm loading Google tag
assistant and now once I refresh the
page I can see that this particular site
has Google tag manager installed and not
only does it have tag manager installed
I can see that it's also has Google
analytics running I have also Google
optimize running and I have Google ads
remarketing tag running in tag manager
so that's what tag assistant does it
allows you to see if one tag manager is
on the site and if it is great what
other tags are firing on this particular
site so tag assistants telling me I have
these particular tags firing on that
site and they're firing within tag
manager so tag assistant is a great way
to confirm if one tag manager is on the
site and two what other tags are firing
on the site now another way you could
confirm if tag manager is firing on the
site is you can go into a pre preview
mode so even before you submit and
publish your tag and Trigger you can
click on the preview mode so if I click
preview in tag manager so basically
that's going to put me in preview mode
and so what does that mean well that
means that now I'm free to go to my
website and see if those tags are firing
and so let's take a look at what that
looks like so if I go to the website and
just click refresh then what's going to
happen is tag manager is going to load
in preview mode just as you see here
okay so that's going to take a second
couple seconds to load up and now what
can I see in preview mode I could see
that I have GTM firing but I also have
some other tags firing on this page
remarketing I have Google analytics I
have Google optimize I have some other
tags firing as well and so the preview
mode shows me what tags are firing on
any given page and I can also see what
tags did not fire okay so here I have a
number of tags already in GTM but they
didn't fire on this particular page so
let's just say I clicked on the Donate
Now button I'm still in preview mode so
I'm going to be able to see what tags
fired now I could see I have a couple of
tags that I've fired on this particular
page and then I can see what tags did
not fire on this page okay so that's the
preview mode you can use the preview
mode before you even sub submit a tag
and Trigger to see if it fires and
that's the great benefit of tag manager
so if you're not sure if something's
going to fire or not then you can always
go into preview mode um and if you are
sure it's going to fire then you can go
ahead and submit it so you can leave
preview mode and just go ahead and
submit that particular tag and Trigger
so here I'm going to leave preview mode
and now once I'm done and I'm sure the
tag is going to fire and go ahead and
submit all my changes that I've worked
on in terms of setting up tags and
triggers so that's really GTM in a
nutshell so I have my tags okay my tags
are just Snippets of code that I'm going
to put in whether that be Facebook or
vet tracking or any other Google product
like optimize or page view then I have
my triggers my triggers are there to
tell GTM when to fire that tag and the
variables are there to help those tags
and triggers work together so remember
that particular variable we set up for
Google analytics okay so here it is
right here because we want to tell GTM
what property to specifically fire in
Google analytics so that's why we set up
that variable but there are all sorts of
variables Google tag manager has built
in or variables already created for you
or you can specifically Define a
variable so variables are there to help
the tags and triggers work together so
when you set up a tag you set set up a
trigger you use a variable you can
always go into preview mode preview it
by going to the website seeing if it
fires if it fires then voila you can go
ahead and click submit and that will
publish the tag and Trigger and you're
good to go that's pretty much how tag
manager works and again I can't stress
that there's an unlimited number of tags
you can add to tag manager there's no
limit so you got everything from
anything from Google to non-google to
event tracking okay to Facebook to
anything that you want to track you want
to be able to put into tag manager and
again there's versioning that's one of
the great benefits of tag manager so if
I want to go back to an older version I
can simply do that so here you can see
I'm on version 32 that's how tag manager
works and I can't stress that you know
tag manager is there to help you track
interact AC ity on the site because if
you have a site that's interactive that
has a video that has a download button
let's just say you know you have all
sorts of newsletter signups Facebook
YouTube buttons on your website just
like this website does and you want to
be able to track how many people click
on that particular button well you're
going to need tag manager and when you
have tag manager you're going to be able
to track all of these button clicks and
interactivity on your website we have
already discussed what copyrighting is
let's begin with some examples of
copyrighting so let's talk about
Coca-Cola's Shar c campaign this one was
a game changer by replacing their iconic
logo with popular names and Bottles
Coca-Cola created a personal connection
with customers it's amazing how a simple
idea of personalizing bottles with names
can drive people to buy and share more
Cokes next up M&M's their tagline melts
in your mouth not in your hands is a
classic it's straightforward and
highlights a unique selling point the
catchy phrase makes you remember the
brand every time you think of chocolate
candies now L'Oreal because you're worth
it is another powerful example this
Logan is all about self-esteem and
empowerment encouraging people to treat
themselves with high quality beauty
products it resonates deeply especially
with your target audience so these
copyrighting examples made a huge impact
by transforming
simple ideas into memorable campaigns
Coca-Cola's sherow cook campaign boosted
sales and engaged customers on a
personal level &m tagline became a
staple phrase that people associated
with the product and L'Oreal's
empowering slogan helped build brand
loyalty and position their products as a
choice for self-care now before going
forward let's take a quick sneak peek
into the history of copywriting or how
this evolved copywriting began in the
late 1800s with John Emory PS known as
the first professional copywriter he
crafted compelling ads for products like
Murphy vanish company highlighting its
durability and shine in the early 1900s
Claude Hopkins revolutionized
advertising with scientific methods
creating effective campaigns like the
famous pepid and toothpaste ad and as
time went on Apple took copyrighting to
new heights with memorable campaigns
like thing different Apple's thing
different campaign launched in the Year
1997 marked a major turning point for
the company featuring famous people like
Albert einon and Mahatma Gandhi its
celebrated creativity and originality
this campaign transformed Apple's image
from a struggling tech company to a
symbol of innovation and uniqueness it
connected deeply with people increased
brand loyalty and set the stage for the
success of products like the iMac iPod
and iPhone overall think different
revitalized Apple and change the way
companies approached advertising today
copyrighting combines classic techniques
with modern strategies for ads websites
and social media to engage audiences and
drive results now you can find various
forms of copywriting around you let's
see each of them one by one first there
are print ads think about those sketchy
headlines and persuasive texts in
magazines newspapers and
billboards then there's online content
this includes website copy blogs and
social media posts for instance
grammarly's blog posts provide valuable
writing tips while Sly promoting their
product next we have email marketing
these are the emails you get about sales
new products or just keeping in touch
for example Netflix personalized
recommendations and new show
announcements keep users engaged and
subscribed Now product descriptions are
another form when you shop online you
see detailed information products right
Apple's product descriptions highlight
the Sleek design and Innovative features
making you want to own that latest gadet
now social media posts are all about
quick engaging copy for instance Oreo is
timely and witty you can still dunk in
the dark tweet during the Super Bowl
blackout became an instant hit finally
landing pages these are Standalone Pages
created for marketing campaigns with
compelling headlines and clear call to
action
companies like Shopify use landing pages
to highlight the ease of setting up an
online store converting visitors into
customers now copywriting is often
confused with content writing so
copywriting and content writing serve
different purposes and require different
approaches copywriting aims to persuade
readers to take immediate action like
making a purchase or signing up for the
newsletter using brief direct and
compelling messages for instance a
product ad saying claim your 50% off
discount code is designed to drive sales
quickly content writing on the other
hand focuses on providing valuable
informative or entertaining content to
engage the audience and build trust over
time an example is a blog post with 10
tips for better H workouts that educates
readers about Fitness while copyrighting
is short and action oriented content
writing is longer detailed and aimed at
offering useful information so
understanding these differences helps
you choose the right approach for your
marketing goals now that you have got a

how to do a proper keyword research so
we looked at Google's Keyword Planner
tool in Google ads and we typed in two
keywords and we were able to get a sense
of what the average volume is so we
definitely want to choose keyw based on
the following factors we want to choose
it based on search volume search volume
is a good indicator of the potential
traffic we can obtain so again for the
key word homemade pizza dough recipe we
know that that it averages 2400 a month
in search volume again we may not get
all 2400 but are we're going to get a
line share of that we also need to look
at competition and so Google's Keyword
Planner gives us a high medium or low in
terms of the competition but if you're
somebody who wants to get a better sense
of what the competition is and you
should because competition is a key
component in choosing keywords and so
what I want to do is get a sense of how
many people are actually optimizing for
that keyword so Google's Keyword Planner
tool is going to give me a low medium
high really what I want to do is get a
better sense of that numerically so what
I can do is go into Google's search and
I can type in pizza recipes and I could
see there's about 1 billion results
that's a lot of results however that
means that every potential web page out
there on the internet that mentions
piece of recipes is going to be included
in this number over here and so I want
to get a better sense of who's
optimizing for pizza recipes so I'm
going to put in the all entitle syntax
and so what that is going to ask Google
to do is tell me all the web sites that
have pizza recipes the keyword pizza
recipes in the title tag so if I do all
in tile colon space then pizza recipes
my result drops down to 336,000 so what
that tells me is that there are 336
6,000 results with the keyword pizza
recipes in the title tag now if I want
to focus in on my other keyword if I
choose uh my other keyword was a longer
tail keyword homemade pizza dough recipe
so if I type that keyword in the
homemade pizza dough recipe or recipes
remember close variance and I just click
enter or type the keyword in hit my
Enter key I'm going to get 35 Million
results but again is that really an
indicator of the type of competition I
have no because every listing that
mentions homemade pizza dough recipes is
going to be included in the search
results so I'm going to type in my all
en title colon space and then I'm going
to get a better sense of how many
websites have the keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes in the title tag and I get
2,160 different results so here I can
see the first result in the title tag
homemade pizza dough recipe second one
home made pizza dough recipe so these
are sites or web pages that have that
keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the
thing you have to understand about SEO
specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few
different keywords not just one or two
so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to
contain keywords that we can potentially
want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my
recommendation is you come up with a
theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's
our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipes so the close variance here is
pizza recipe what was the volume well we
know the volume was 33,100 for pizza
recipe so what are we going to do we're
going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition
well if we go back and type in p of
recipes it was 683 th000 so I'm going to
type in
683 th000 what was our next keyword well
it was pizza or homemade pizza dough
recipes so if I go back for this
particular keyword is400 so I'm going to
put 2400 in under my volume column and
then what was my competition well my
competition was if I type that keyword
back in 2160 so I'm going to put
2,160 so now I have an idea
of what kind of volume and what kind of
competition I have now you want to do
this for a number of different keywords
and when you do it for number keywords
what you do want to do is obviously
choose a relevant keyword that has high
volume and low competition so another
way of saying it is the volume or ratio
of volume to competition and so
basically what we could do is take
volume divided by competition and if I
make that a percentage I can see it's.
35% % is the ratio between volume and
competition if I do the same for my
longer tail keyword 2400 / 2160 I can
see that 111% so this just kind of
proves the point that yeah I'm still
going to get some volume but I have a
better chance of ranking for this longer
teal keyword homemade pizza dough
recipes so you want to be able to do
that for number of keywords and examine
the volume the competition and the ratio
between volume and competition for your
themed keywords in this case pizza
recipes so relevancy you want to choose
keywords that are very relevant to the
content that you're writing and then
again commercial intent what keywords
are going to drive more conversions and
revenue for the business so when we talk
about commercial intent we're talking
about you know are you choosing keywords
that are going to get somebody to do
what you want them to do so we could say
You Know download pizza dough recipes so
somebody's typing in the keyword
download pza pizza dough recipes then
chances are they're going to find you
come to your site and take action by
downloading that pizza dough recipe so
you want to be able to also think about
the intent of the keyword is it going to
help you drive conversions and revenue
if you're an Ecommerce site so search
volume is the average monthly search
volume made for a particular keyword and
phrase so we can get that number using
Google's Keyword Planner tool in the
Google ads platform we want to Target
keywords with high search volume that
will help bring traffic to the website
we want volume but we want to take into
account seasonality as well so that's
where the Google's Keyword Planner tool
comes in place because if we go back
again we can just hover over we get a
sense of any particular Trend going on
or seasonality so for example if I saw
large growth in the winter months and
not much volume growth in the summer
months then that might indicate to me
that this keyword it's more popular
during the winter time so pay attention
to the graphs that you know the keybo
Planner tool gives you use them to your
advantage to take into account
seasonality so a good example would be
funny Halloween costumes well we know
that for Halloween you're going to have
a spike probably towards the end of
September all the way through October
and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so
that's an example but in the case of
pizza recipes you know you find that
more people are choosing to search for
pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay
attention to seasonality it will affect
search volume so competition based on
our example it's one of the most
important key metrics you don't want to
choose a keyword that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive
then it's going to be harder to rank
number one or even on page one of Google
depending how competitive it is so high
search volume low competition in other
words the ratio between the two is the
ideal combination so going back to the
spreadsheet recommend you have that
spreadsheet handy put your theme in
place okay theme pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find
the volume we use the all entitled
syntax to find the competition so we
entered both of those numbers in and we
get our ratio and so when you have these
numbers for a number of different
keywords you want to be able to choose
that ratio of high volume low
competition but always relevancy always
trumps ratio so always go with a keyword
that is going to be relevant to your
content don't choose a keyword that's
not relevant if you choose a keyword
that's not relevant it's not going to
bode well for user engagement so the
difficulty of a keyword ranges from 0 to
100 and Google's keyword tool so it's
going to be easy it's going to be medium
it's going to be hard but my recommend
is also to get the numerical factor and
that's the all and title syntax and
again relevancy is what drives the
traffic to your website and keep the
traffic there on your website and also
not only will it keep the traffic on
your website but hopefully get that
traffic to engage and convert so that's
the key about relevancy you always want
to choose keywords that are relevant to
your content even if it's sacrificing
volume relevancy again trumps volume
volume and competition so always choose
relevant keywords first so when you do
that you're always almost guaranteeing
that it's some point somebody's going to
find your content because somebody out
there might be looking for it and if
they do you're going to get found and
then the engagement is going to be
better so understand your business find
key wordss that are relevant to your
business and then focus on those key
words that'll help you with getting the
right traffic to your site always keep
in mind the commercial tent so these key
wordss are more specific and result in
conversion rate for example buying is a
good commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your
website and buy then focus on those
types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could
be our commercial intent keyword again
there may be low search volume but those
are the type of keywords you want to
focus on because that's the type of
traffic you want to drive to your site
so some other examples of commercial
intent keywords are discount deal your
coupon shipping you don't don't be
afraid to use some of these keywords as
part of your longer tail keyword phrase
again the volume may not be high but the
traffic quality is probably going to be
better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen
your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's
going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk
about keywords we also want to talk
about are primary and secondary keyword
so every page should have at least a
primary keyword and then a secondary
keyword to work with so primary keywords
are really defining the nature of your
content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why
do we choose a primary and secondary
keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to
the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that's
secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to
content and you may rank for that
secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one
keyword you want to give your yourself a
chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant
nature so for web page there can be
several secondary keywords but only one
primary keyword so your primary keyword
is always going to be relevant to your
content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may
have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the
content and it gives you a better
opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary in search Okay so
let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and
secondary keywords when choosing
keywords so if a primary keyword is
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet
plan is directly related to the content
so that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also
related to content and play off the
primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to Google's Keyword Planner
tool and get an idea of the volume for
healthy diet plan and then also the
volume and competition for some of these
secondary keywords like healthy diet for
weight loss healthy diet food low carb
diet healthy mail plans and diet plan
weight loss so if I go in to Google's
Keyword Planner and type those keywords
in I'm going to choose get results and
now here I could see healthy diet plan
keyword I'm focusing on as my primary
keyword has an average monthly search
volume of
99,900 and then some of my secondary
keywords healthy diet foods diet plan
weight loss low carb diet you know
Google will give me a number of
different keywords to work with so I'm
going to look at the search volume of
those as well and so ideally what I want
to do is be able to then look at the
volume and then look at the competition
so healthy diet plan I go in into my
keyword analysis here that's my theme so
that's my keyword what's my volume for
healthy diet plan
99,900 what's my competition so my
competition is
74,700 and that's going to give me a
ratio a volume the competition of 13% so
that's what my content's about that's a
considered a short tail keyword because
it has a lot of competition and so my
ratio is 133% and what I want to do is I
want to be able able to put these other
secondary keywords in here as well maybe
even go to a little longer tail cuz I
want to be able to find two key at least
two keywords I want to be able to find
my primary keyword that's relevant to my
content and then I want to be able to
find my secondary keyword which is again
related to the primary keyword which is
also related to the content and so I
want to be able to choose two keywords
basically and I want to choose two
keywords that are relevant that have
good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea
again of how to do keyword research you
want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and get a
sense of what the volume is what the
competition is look at the ratio between
the volume and competition and then
based on the content choose that primary
keyword and then again based on the
keyword you chose choose some secondary
keywords as well because you want to be
found for not just one keyword but
multiple keywords we're going to talk
about how to rank number one on Google
so let's get started and um let's go
with the scenario that you have a friend
named Sam and he has a website where he
sells shoes but Sam doesn't understand
why his website's not ranking number one
on Google and so typically the rank
number one on Google there are some
factors involved and those are factors
that are going to help Sam get his
website ranked number one on Google so
he can sell his shoes get traffic and
convert that traffic to conversions so
there are factors involved and so what
are those factors well it always starts
with keyword research so in order to
rank for a website where you sell shoes
or you sell products other products like
clothing or food or you're an automobile
website you know you're a mechanic it
doesn't matter whether you're selling to
customers or selling to other businesses
you have to start with the keyword
research and so we're going to go into
really explicit detail on how to conduct
a proper keyword research and then the
second factor involved is high quality
content so in order to rank high on
Google search you need to have high
quality content so we're going to go
over what's involved with creating high
quality content then we're going to take
that content we're going to optimize it
using onpage elements and website level
factors so we're going to take into
account what's involved with your
website and what's involved with
specific pages on your website in order
to rank number one on Google then we're
going to get into the offsite engagement
so when it comes to ranking on Google
you need to optimize your website and
you need to do some elements off your
website you need to be engaging off your
website meaning on other other websites
and so we're going to talk about what's
involved with offside engagement so SEO
being a major channel for most companies
and websites where the opportunity to
drive a lot of traffic is there but you
have to earn that reward the reward is a
lot of traffic but you have to earn the
reward and there's a lot of work
involved and so ideally what we want to
do is follow what we call the 8020 rule
when it comes to search engine
optimization and ranking on Google and
what do we mean by the 8020 rule well
8020 means we're investing 20% of our
effort and 80% of the results are
obtained so we want to invest 20 and get
back 80 that's basically what we Me by
8020 so for example if 20% of our
targeted keywords bring in 80% of the
traffic then that's following the 8020
rule or 20% of our landing pages Drive
80% of the overall traffic that's
following the 8020 rule or 20% of our
backlinks pass 80% of our link jues
that's the 8020 rule meaning these
targeted keywords these targeted landing
pages these trying to Target backlinks
using offsite engagement we want to put
in 20% of our effort on those keywords
landing pages and backlinks in return
for 80% of the results so without
further Ado let's get started with the
keyword research let's talk about that
keyword research for a website with
shoes and and it doesn't really matter
what particular product you have if you
need to rank number one on Google it all
starts with the keywords as I mentioned
before and so in this example if you
have a website where you sell shoes for
kids you're going to want to be found
for certain keywords so the obvious
keyword here would be shoes for kids
well every key word that you target has
search volume asso assciated with it so
that means when we talk about search
volume we're talking about how many
people on average type in that keyword
or related keyword on google.com or
Google search and there's always an
average number of searches associated
with every keyword and we call that
search volume how much search volume so
obviously if we're going to Target a
keyword we want to have as much volume
as possible however there's always going
to be competition for those keywords
meaning there's always going to be other
websites who want to rank number one on
Google for the same keywords and we call
that competition or difficulty so for
every keyword you're going to have
volume and you're going to have
competition or difficulty and the
difficulty ranges as well depending on
the tool you use and we'll get into that
in a minute but search volume is how
much on average people are typing in
that keyword or close variance of that
keyword and the difficult difficulty is
measured in terms of kids is highly
relevant has high volume and low
competition then that's a keyword we
want to Target so we always want to
focus in on those three areas so there's
always a tradeoff with keywords so shoes
for kids might have high volume but also
might have high competition or
difficulty if we look for another
keyword that's just as relevant for
example shoes for children it may still
have high search volume but the compet
ition or the difficulty may be lower and
if that's the case then that may be a
better keyword for us to Target instead
of something highly competitive like
shoes for kids we can focus on another
relevant keyword like shoes for children
with just as much volume and lower
competition and the reason why we want
lower competition is because we want to
be able to rank for that keyword so the
higher the competition the harder it is
for us to rank number one on Google for
that keyword and so the whole idea
Beyond keyword research is analyzing and
choosing the best keywords so we want to
identify a list of keywords that are
always relevant we want to choose the
keyword that your competitors are
ranking for and we want to use third
party tools to choose keywords to
identify which keywords have low
competition and what keywords have high
search volume so one thing to take into
consideration when you're doing keyword
research is that the longer the keyword
phrase or in other words longtail
keywords or keywords with three keywords
in the phrase or more you're going to
always have less competition but there's
always a tradeoff with longtail keywords
meaning the longer the keyword phrase
there's going to be less volume but the
trade-off is less competition and so
what we want to do is we want to
brainstorm some ideas and find those
relevant keywords so let's look at an
example here so if we go to Google ads
so Google ads has a tool called Keyword
Planner and let's just say I have a a
website where I'm selling dried figs and
if I'm selling dried figs I want people
to buy these dried figs however in order
to attract them I want to be able to
show them that hey we have a a bunch of
recipes and if I show you a bunch of
recipes where you can use dried figs
maybe you'll buy these dried figs to
using these recipes and so we're going
to look for keywords related to bread
recipes because if we can optimize for
our recipes page for bread then that
will attract an audience who wants to
make bread and use dried figs with those
bread recipes so that's the example I'm
going to give here and so if I look at
the Keyword Planner in Google ads if I
just type in bread recipes what Google
is going to do is they're going to give
me an average monthly search volume so I
can see the average monthly search
volume here is 60,500 and so in order to
keyword volume in the competition you're
getting for certain keywords so if I go
into a spreadsheet here my theme of
keywords is bread recipes my keyword is
bread recipes and my volume therefore is
going to be 60,500 however if I go back
into Google's Keyword Planner Google's
telling me the competition is low so
that's great I want high volume I want
low competition but how low is low so we
want to be careful so if we're going to
put in numbers into a spreadsheet we
want to figure out what that competition
really is for the keyword bread recipes
so if I go to Google and just type in
bread recipes I'm going to be able to
see
771 billion results for the keyword
bread recipes now is 771 billion are
real competition maybe maybe not what we
want to do is put in a syntax and we
want to put in the syntax all in title
and then colon space and then our
keyword and the reason why we do that in
search is because we want to be able to
identify the true competitive number or
the true number of websites who are
trying to rank for bread recipes and if
we put in the syntax all entitle colon
and then our keyword bread recipes we'll
be able to see that there are $998,000
th000 results that's a lot lower than
771 billion so that means that
98,000 sites or listings have the
keyword bread recipes in the title tag
and the title tag is what shows up in
the search engine results and so if I
look down and scroll down here I can see
bread recipes are everyone of these
title tags so title tag is an important
element to rank number one on Google and
we'll talk about that in a few minutes
but if we understand that there are
998,199
18,000 in my spreadsheet as the
competitive number and so now I could
see for the keyword bread recipes I have
60,500 and if my competition is
999,000 then my Kei or keyword
Effectiveness index or in other words
the ratio of volume to competition is 6%
so that's nothing more than volume
divided by competition so that tells me
that my Kei or my ratio between volume
competition is 6% % so remember we want
more volume than we want competition so
anytime you do a keyword research you're
going to find a number of different
relevant keywords so if I go back into
Google's Keyword Planner if I typed in
bread recipes you could see that Google
is going to give me a number of
different keywords related to bread
recipes let's just say I have another
keyword that I want to think about
optimizing for being ranked on Google
for and that's banana bread recipe very
similar keyword as bread recipes except
it's a little longer tail now if I type
in banana bread recipe in Google's
Keyword Planner now I can see the
average monthly search volume is
actually gone up it's
368,000 I can also see the competition
is low so those are good signs so now I
can see 368,000 I'm going to go ahead
and put that in my spreadsheet now I'm
going to go into Google I'm going to put
in my syntax all en title I'm going to
put in banana bread recipe I'm going to
hit enter and now I can see I have
233,000 results with the keyword banana
bread recipe in the title tag so if I
look at the title tags I can see banana
bread recipe banana bread recipe banana
bread recipe on all the listings in the
Google search results so that tells me I
have 233,000 results that I have to jump
over inorder order to rank number one on
Google so I'm going to put 233,000 in my
spreadsheet now I can see my Kei or my
volume to competition ratio is 157
158% and so to me that's a lot better
number to work with or in other words
that's a lot better keyword because it's
just as relevant and it has a higher
ratio of volume to competition so
therefore banana bread recipe is going
to be a better keyword to optimize for
in order to rank number one on Google so
that's the whole idea behind keyword
research you want to brainstorm ideas
there are plenty of tools out there so
the tool I recommend is Google ads
Keyword Planner Google's going to give
you how much search volume they're going
to tell you the competition but then
you're going to go into Google search
you're going to use the syntax all in
title to get a more accurate read read
on the actual competitive number and so
to find out how keywords that your
competitors are ranking for you can use
those keyword tools that I mentioned
another tool that I use is MZ so MZ if
you go to moz.com they have a tool
called keyword Explorer so if we just
type in the keyword for example bread
recipes it's going to be able to tell us
how much volume and the difficulty so
you can use other tools at your disposal
figure out the volume and the difficulty
there are plenty of tools out there but
the one thing I would just make sure is
you use everything at your disposal so
you can use social media to find the
most shared article for a particular
topic or keyword like bread recipes you
could check other platforms that have a
lot of shared content like readin and
Kora where you can ask people about
certain topics using keywords to figure
out how much competition or volume there
might be you can stay up to date on
industry news to get an idea of what
types of keywords are trending but when
it comes to keywords and keyword
research remember for every web page we
want to be able to pick two keywords we
want a primary and secondary keyword so
when we do keyword research and we enter
all our keywords into our spreadsheet we
want to be able to have a number of
different keywords in this case we're
focusing on the theme bread recipes we
want to have different keywords because
we want to be able to choose a primary
keyword and a secondary keyword because
we want to be able to focus on multiple
keywords for each page because we don't
want to put necessarily all our eggs in
one basket maybe we won't want to put
all our emphasis just on one keyword to
rank four we want multiple keywords to
try and rank for so the primary keyword
can Define the nature of our business
the secondary keyword can be be just
highly relevant to our keyword at the
end of the day we want to choose
multiple keywords to try and rank on
Google for that page so for example we
have a Blog and we're using ice cream
recipes and we're blogging about ice
cream recipes we can have a primary
keyword that is about ice cream recipes
or homemade ice cream recipes we're
going to always want to find out what
the volume and the competition is our
secondary keyword could be build around
other similar keywords like lowfat ice
cream recipes or fat-free ice cream
recipes or lowfat homemade ice cream
recipes those are complimentary keywords
just like our bread recipes and banana
bread recipe so one thing we want to do
when we do keyword research is we want
to be able to Target one keyword per
content when you can Target many we want
to be able to Target multiple keywords
not necessarily Target one one keyword
and so we want to be able to Cluster
keywords so we don't want to Target just
one we want to Target multiple keywords
per page and when we talk about
clustering if we go back to our keyword
research what we're doing is we're
clustering a bunch of keywords under the
theme bread recipes and so by looking at
the volume looking at the competition
looking at the Kei we can choose
different keywords for our page and
that's what we mean by clustering we
want to Cluster keywords into a Content
theme so why Target only one keyword per
content when we can Target many because
we don't want to put all our eggs in one
basket we don't want to Target just one
keyword we want to Target many and so
that means clustering your keywords into
a theme and choosing multiple keywords
for that particular page and when we do
that we have a better opportunity to
rank high on Google Search and the whole
idea behind ranking on Google Search is
we can get the volume so if we know
we're ranked number one on Google search
for bread recipes or banana bread recipe
we know we stand a chance of getting a
majority of the volume associated with
that keyword and if we can get the
volume and get the traffic then we can
get the conversions so let's move on to
high quality content and talk about the
impact content has on your ability to
get your website ranked number one on
Google so let's just say you have
content on your website and the content
is ranking on you know page four of
Google and it's that blog with ice cream
recipes and if it's just content for the
sake of content is not really
informative then it's not necessarily
going to get good engagement in the eyes
of Google you know they want to rank
content that's very informative it's
very fresh it's exciting to read it's
interesting it's going to have good
engagement so if it's a recipe or an
article about any topic if it's the
content is just not informative then
you're not going to get good engagement
and when you don't get good engagement
if people don't stay on the site to
engage in the content and they just
leave the website after Ling on the page
causing a bounce then the content is
just going to continue to fall down the
rankings and we want to prevent that we
want move up the rankings we want to be
number one on Google we don't
necessarily want to fall in the rankings
for our content so content is a key
driver in being able to rank number one
on Google so if the content is on page
nine what can we do well we want to be
able to you know take that content and
do something with it we feel like we did
write engaging content so let's go ahead
and share it on social media and to me
social media is a good platform form to
share your content because on social
media platforms like Facebook for
example you're building a community on
that platform that Community is already
interested in your content so if you're
sharing an ice cream recipe especially
in the summertime and you're engaging
with your community on that platform
then the likelihood of that community on
that platform is going to increase
engagement increased engagement will
send social signals to the search engine
that says hey this content is good
quality likewise for any other platform
most social media platforms have
engagement metrics and those engagement
metrics pass signals is it good is it
not good do we like this content are we
giving it a thumbs up are we going to
want to follow it are we going to want
to share it and so if you share content
that you feels engaging on social
platforms then it's going to be engaging
and it's likely going to cause an inre
increase in engagement for example a
decrease in balances and once you share
that quality content then the likelihood
of it moving up the rankings even as far
as number one on Google is going to be
greater so you always want to start out
writing good quality content so let's
talk about good quality content because
Google does take content seriously they
do take into account what other people
think of that content so high quality
content is an important factor so how to
create good content that's always the
question so let's talk about some best
practices here remember in the last
segment we talked about keyword research
so we want to perform good keyword
research why because we want to choose
keywords remember we're choosing
multiple keywords per page one keyword
could be related to our brand one
keyword could be related to the content
but another keyword could be related to
a user's intent like recipes if you call
the example we use with bread recipes
maybe somebody's looking to type in a
keyword that says how do I make you know
a bread or how do I make a specific type
of bread or how do I make banana bread
or what's the best recipe for banana
bread they're question related and we
want to be able to answer those
questions so that's where choosing those
right keywords that's going to respond
to a user's intent so starts with
choosing the right keywords so remember
we talked about a number of different
tools when we talked about keyword
research so there's a research tool that
you can use called phrase. iio and that
will help you do quick research on you
know keywords and Trends and whatnot so
if you know about a research tool that
you use for keyword research then drop
us a comment below I'd be interested in
getting your comments about keyword
research and what research tools are out
there so if you know something better
than phrase. drop a comment below
and we'd be interested in getting your
perspective so keyword research is key
but creating content that fulfills users
requirements so answering those
questions if it's a recipe we want to
answer that question if it's directions
we want to answer that question if they
don't know how to do something we want
to answer that question and that's the
whole idea behind content content is not
just to fill a page it's to really
fulfill users requirements that's when
you get good engagement so if somebody's
typing in something on Google and
they're looking for an answer your
content should answer that question but
we also want to make the content
readable so in other words you know
write for your audience don't impress
anybody with very high vocabulary type
words that somebody doesn't necessarily
know the meaning of don't use jargon
don't use a street language for example
use everyday common language that's just
easily digestible when your audience is
reading then we want to keep that
content organized and so when we mean
organized we want to use headers and
subheaders you know break your content
into the paragraphs keep the flow
organized if we can keep the flow
organized then it's going to be easier
for somebody to read and then it's okay
to add resources especially resources
from credible sites so if you can
incorporate those resources in there
then it's just going to add The
credibility to your content let the
audience know that hey I've done my
research on this topic and this is what
this person has to say about it this
person who seems to be credible okay so
it only adds value to your content so
these are all tips to Remember When
creating content and then the one
important tip here is we want to use
white hat techniques and when we say wh
hat techniques that means you know if
we've chosen keywords that are going to
answer somebody's question we don't want
to stuff those keywords into the content
we want the content to be naturally
written so when we say op for white heck
uh techniques that's what we mean write
the content naturally keep it organized
keep it readable include third party
sources and make sure it answers a
question so there are different types of
content so there's content where you
just write words it's all text based you
can also use an infographic infographic
is simply just a graphic that visualizes
exactly what you're trying to explain
for example if we want to Rite an
article about how to write good engaging
content we don't necessarily have to
write all that out as a text we can
create an infographic so for example
here's an infographic on 20 effective
ways to basically not bore your readers
but write engaging content so you could
see this is an infographic it's all
graphically laid out so infographics
tend to be easier to understand because
they're visual they're easy for the end
us to comprehend because there's
generally no jargon it's usually images
that are portraying the point of what
you're trying to get across and so it
tends to break it up the monotony of
just text it's more visually appealing
and it's laid out and organized so you
can see this infographic has 20
different steps or rules and they lay
those out all here in this infographic
and the great thing I like about
infographics is you could you could
share them on social media you can
re-engage them them as a post you can
save them on really any social platform
so infographics tend to tell a better
story versus say just writing text you
can use video and images so you don't
necessarily have to lay it all out in an
infographic you can certainly insert a
video or an image into your content
especially if it's a blog post if it's a
blog post then sometimes video and
images on its own tell the story you
don't necessarily need text to go ahead
and tell your story a video or an image
as they say tells a thousand words and
so images and videos are great to use in
a blog post so using different forms of
content you know you always want to
review your content when a user dwells
on your web page for a longer time
Google will tend to think okay this
person's engaged so we're going to rank
that favorably so if you're using using
infographics videos and images then the
chances of somebody being more engaged
are going to increase versus just text
that's not well organized and written
out in a way that somebody doesn't
necessarily understand so be creative in
the types of content you use so longer
engaging content tends to bode well with
search engines so this is according to
HubSpot so the more word count you use
the more words you use the chances of
you ranking higher are going to be
better just take into account best
practices you want to maybe break up the
content with an image organize it make
it engaging use headers so it's not
necessarily just words it's the words
and how those words are written how
they're structured the types of key
words you're using how you're engaging
with your audience there's a lot of
factors again there best practices we
just went over but the key is you know
if you have longer more engaging content
then it's going to bode better for you
on search engines so couple of steps to
create high quality content so you want
to begin with a comprehensive
introduction so always introduce your
content remember the content should be
relevant to the keyword so if you're
choosing keywords in your keyword
research think about answering that
question if somebody's typing in bread
recipes maybe they're looking for banana
bread recipes how how to make the best
banana bread or how to make banana bread
using dried figs we want to be able to
align our content with that keyword
naturally you want to create a title
that's worthy that's click worthy so
remember if you're in Google search and
you're doing search for something simple
like bread recipes we want to some make
something that's going to be you know
gauging for somebody to click on like
easy perfect yeast bread or easy crusty
French bread or something that's going
to be engaging you know the best bread
recipes or how to make the best homemade
bread you know something that's going to
draw somebody's attention to the title
of that blog post so we want to include
LSI keywords so what I mean by LSI
keywords in your content we mean you
know longtail keywords make it natural
headings and subing should consist of
keywords and variants so if you're
writing headers and subheaders include
the keyword in there and that way the
the content always stays relevant to the
audience okay shorten your sentences and
paragraphs so don't write long
paragraphs remember we want to break
this up we want to make it easy for the
end user to read and we want to always
put internal links on our blog post why
because if we have internal links then
if we have a link from one blog post to
another blog post or say our blog post
to an internal page page on our website
we want to make sure that it's relevant
content that way if somebody's reading
something and you have an internal link
let's just say from a bread recipes page
to a banana bread recipes page then they
may find it interesting click on that
link and go to the banana bread recipes
page so it's keeping somebody engaged on
your website so putting in internal
linking will help keep the the end user
engaged because you're offering up links
that's relevant into the content you
always want to break up that content
with images okay we want to use alt tags
meaning we want to pen the image with
text so that way if the image doesn't
load then at least the alt text will
load so we can incorporate call out
boxes and more importantly we want to
update our content regularly so we
always want to get the best recipe out
there if it's banana bread or different
ways to banana bread or always just
coming up with ways to update the
content so we want to keep our content
our blog post fresh and then we want to
include a CTA call to action if we
include a call to action then that's
going to keep somebody engaged and have
them act on your content so these are
steps to creating high quality content
and so let's look at an example here and
this is a 3month Old Post on BuzzFeed
and it's 21 pictures that we rest your
faith in humanity so it has a lot of
likes a lot of tweaks and that means
it's engaged people are engaged when
reading that and so if we go and look at
it as an example we could see it in on
BuzzFeed here 21 pictures that will
restore your faith in humanity so this
was written back in 2012 again a lot of
Engagement but if we look at it we can
see immediately that it's taking into
account third party sources it's got
some content it's got images it's being
broken up by images we could see there's
call to actions on there in the form of
social so people can go ahead and go
ahead and share it if they like it okay
it includes videos it includes images
third party sources so it's a good post
because listen you know it's engaging
content it's probably answering
somebody's question about humanity and
we could see clearly that look you know
there's a lot of different examples here
from a lot lot of different sources and
we could take action on this content so
not just video not just images but text
as well and so it's very engaging
answers questions takes into account the
different types of content available so
this is a good post in that regard so
content updated regularly it's engaging
and it includes sources from high
Authority websites some dos and don'ts
on the content so take into account the
best practices I mentioned about
creating High quality content okay
answer those questions that the end user
wants to hear you know CU that likely is
going to be their search and so you want
to be able to respond to the end user
that's part of creating high quality
content different types of content I.E
in the form of infographics or videos or
text or images you can add images from
public domain sites you can be relatable
and use examples to clarify points just
like the BuzzFeed article simplify
complex words don't use sophisticated
language talk to your audience as if you
they were standing right in front of you
and use bullet points to exemplify your
examples your points so some dos the
don'ts obviously don't lift content we
don't want to lift content from another
website so that's plagiarism so we want
to have our own unique content we also
don't want to take images from other
websites and so if you do happen to find
an image that works for your post and
it's on somebody else's website ideally
that's not a good situation but if you
do happen to do that then always give
credit to the website okay so if you
took it from xyz.com credit xyz.com for
the image and even put a link back but
ideally you don't want to take images
from other websites just as much as you
don't want to take copy you don't want
to take images use your own imagery and
content but if you don't have imagery
then you can always go to stock
photography there are plenty of websites
out there where you can sign up for a
subscription like uh Adobe stock images
as an example you could sign up for an
account and in some cases you can sign
up for a free account and use stock
imagery okay don't give less information
to your audience give your audience what
they deserve which is the information
they're looking for they're looking for
the best banana bread recipes give them
the best banana bread reci recipes
incorporate your own images break it up
with titles give them a good quality
piece of content that they're going to
be able to engage with and so if you put
long paragraphs in your content then
it's going to be less engaging so try to
avoid those long paragraphs remember
shorten up the paragraphs keep the
language simple add in images answer
those questions use third party credible
sources but write it in your own words
and should be on your way to creating
good quality content okay so now that
we've talked about high quality content
in order to get your pages ranked high
on Google search let's turn our
attention to optimizing onpage elements
and discuss some website level factors
that are both going to help you rank
high on Google search so let's just do
an overview of what we're talking about
when we talk about onpage elements and
website level factors so optimizing on
page elements include a number of
different things but primarily we're
going to focus in on metat tags also
known as meta description tags header
tags also known as title tags and URLs
so those are just some of the on page
elements we want to be able to optimize
using relevant keywords in order to rank
high on Google search we also want to
take a look at some website factors that
will effect our ranking on Google search
they include website architecture having
a secure website having a Sit map and
taking a look at page speed so all of
those are some of the website factors we
need to take into account in order to
rank K and Google search so title tag
and meta description together are
considered meta tags so both play an
important role in ranking high on Google
so we want to be able to write unique
title and descriptions for each page on
our website when I say unique that means
a title and The Meta description need to
be different for every page on the
website and so if you're not quite sure
what a title tag and a meta description
tag is if you go to search and just type
in any particular search query the title
tag is what's going to show up here in
bold and then the description is going
to show up below it below the URL and
that's going to describe the page so
both of these meta tags are important
because it describes what your page is
all about and that's what Google uses in
the search results pages so we want to
be able to pay attention to the length
of our metat tags so if we go back to
our search results Pages met title tags
are generally 6065 characters meta
description tags are generally 160
characters so anything really longer
than that then what's going to happen is
is the meta description tag or the title
tag will get truncated and so if we look
here for example we can see all of the
title tags here fit the 65 character
limit but if you run over the character
C on meta description then Google is
going to truncate the copy so you want
to stay within your parameters in order
to avoid getting your content truncated
and so the other thing when we're
writing title metad description tags we
want to minimize keyword repetition so
if we're optimizing for keyword we don't
want to necessarily just plug that
keyword into the title tag and meta
description multiple times we want to
make sure our title tags and meta
descriptions are naturally written so if
somebody's typing for banana bread
recipe with dried fix you know we want
to have a nice title tag and this
description that is going to get
somebody to respond uh based on on their
need and so we definitely want to avoid
keyword repetition but we want to be
able to use that keyword in the title
tag because if you remember from the
earlier segment when we did the all and
title syntax to find out exactly how
many competitors were using that
particular keyword well we obviously
want to use that keyword in the title
tag because again the title tag is an
important factor when it comes to search
engine results so we want to use the
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or
use using it repetitively in our title
tag and our meta description we want the
title tag and The Meta description to
describe the page sound natural but also
be engaging because the point is we want
people to click on our link and go to
our website from search engines so title
tags with numbers tend to result in
higher click the rates this is according
to mods so for example if you just put
in a title tag that says learn digital
marketing well well that may work but if
you put a number in there like five easy
ways to learn digital marketing that
might get somebody to click on your link
and go to your website so having
questions in your metax can also
increase your clickr A for example if
you just put learn the importance of
first page rankings not too bad but they
again generic but if you put it into the
formal question how to rank number one
on Google it's more action oriented it's
going to get somebody to resonate with
the question that they have and that may
be their query how to rank number one on
Google and so these techniques will help
you get higher click through rates and
so according to back Linko title tag
with a keyword can improve site ranking
so remember we want to include that
keyword in the title tag even though we
only have 65 characters we want to
include that keyword but we want to
avoid stuffing the keyword in there we
want to again make the title tag action
oriented maybe with a number maybe as a
question with the keyword in there once
naturally not easy to do but that's the
beauty of SEO if you can follow these
best practices and write a good title
tag then the chances of you improving in
your search results are going to be
greater so having only one H1 tag in
your post is going to be good so
remember when somebody clicks on a link
so let's just say they do find a title
tag engaging and they click on this this
link here and they go to that website
you know you want to start out with
having that particular H1 tag cu the H1
tag especially with the keyword in it is
going to signal to Google hey we're
organizing our page and because it's an
H1 tag it's important we're structuring
the page according to best practices so
having only one H1 tag in your post is
definitely helpful having multiple tags
H tags in your post help organize the
page a lot better so we want to add that
targeted keyword in that tag and your
header tag should be relevant to the
content so if we go back to our example
of the using dried figs with banana
breads well the title says California
fig banana bread and remember the last
segment when we were talking about high
quality content will look no further
than including a video into our content
so not only will this video help keep
the engagement high but it breaks up the
monotony of the page and it's from a
third party source so it adds
credibility to the page so adding a
videos based on the last segment of high
quality content definitely helps with
ranking high on Google search so
following hierarchal structure that
means putting those H tags in there H2
tags help break up the content and we
want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on
your different web pages of your site
meaning don't just put the same H1 tag
with the same keyword in it and keeping
it Blas we want to make those H1 tags
exciting to read but also used
appropriately to break up the content so
remember all white hat techniques we
want to avoid hidden text we want to
avoid stuffing keywords we want things
to be natural we don't want things to be
forced and you're H1 tag should be 20 to
70 characters don't make long H1 tags so
if we go back to our page example a
short sweet tag here California fig
banana bread it's relevant to the
content it's short sweet it breaks up
the monotony of the content and more
importantly again any content you have
on the page should always answer the
users intent remember people are using
search to answer questions find
information our cont content should be
able to answer that for them so
according to John Moher senior Web
Master Trends Analyst at Google header
tags would definitely help Google for
rankings and the search results so we
want to use header tags so when it comes
to URLs we want to use hyphens and avoid
underscores so if we look at this URL
here this uses hyphens fig and banana
bread so it's all broken up with hyphens
that's a best practice remember Canon
URLs a canonical URL signals to Google
this is the original content so we want
to use original content and if you have
multiple sources of content out there on
say different websites we want to use a
canonical tag to signal to Google this
is the original content please Index
this content and not doesn't hurt to use
a favon URL meaning a small icon it
helps to break up the monotony and help
your URL stand out we can add targeted
keywords in the URL so again looking at
the URL here I can see we're using
targeted keyword as part of the URL
structure fig and banana bread and
notice the H1 tag is fig banana bread so
it's all consistent and it flows
naturally URLs that are no longer
existing then we want to be able to set
up a redirect for those URLs meaning a
301 redirect is a server response for
Google that says Hey Google this page is
no longer available but it we
permanently redirected it to this page
which is now available so that's what a
301 redirect does it helps signal to
Google and all the other search engines
that if the page is no longer there
that's fine you're just going to go to
this page this is the page that's
permanently there now and another thing
we want to do here is if you have mobile
URLs you want to include those in the
sitemap and we're going to hit on that
in just a minute but all urls should be
mobile friendly as well as desktop
friendly meaning take into account this
best practices keep your url short use
hyphens put the keyword in that URL and
make it easy to understand want to avoid
capital letters in the URLs the URLs are
case sensitive so go lowercase you
should always go lowercase on the URL
readable URLs again the rule of thumb
here is if you understand what the URL
is then go Google is going to understand
what the URL is so the shorter the URL
the easier it is to read the easier it
is to read the better chance you have to
rank high on Google search so according
to backlink to URLs that are shorter
definitely definitely help you rank so
we want to be able to shorten those URLs
keep them short and sweet don't make
them long and unreadable so those are
some on optimized ways or on page
elements that help you optimize now we
want to look at some website level
factors that will help you optimize and
rank high on Google search so good site
structure provides better crawling for
search engine Bots and what do we mean
by that well we mean having your site
organized in a fashion that Google's
going to be able to find all the pages
so what do we mean by that create a
logical hierarchy structure so if you're
selling shoes you know you're going to
have a homepage break the structure up
into men's shoes women's shoes children
Children's Shoes then under men's shoes
you could have it by brand it could be
Nike Puma Adidas on the women's side it
could be Nike Puma Adidas on the child
side it could be Nike Puma Adidas and so
you want to keep the structure flow in a
hierarchy so we want to balance the
amount of subcategories within each
category so the men's if it has Nike
Puma Adidas the women should have Nike
Puma Adidas and so you want to code your
site navigation in CSS or HTML meaning
we want to be able to use something that
Google is going to be able to index so
most sites are built in HTML and that's
what Google likes to index they like to
index something that they could take
back to their servers and then more
importantly build a comprehensive
structure for internal linking so
internal links mean that if you're on a
site you should have natural links
pointing to other pages on your website
so to keep the flow going and we don't
want to have unnatural inbound things
you always want to have natural internal
links to keep the flow of the user going
from one page to the other so here I can
see as an example all the ingredients in
this recipe well this has an internal
link to another page on our site and
this happens to link to a page where
somebody can buy the ingredients so it's
a natural internal l so John dhy of
Credo has claimed that one of the
biggest changes that he can make in
fixing the creative website is
architecture so for example in Credo
John dhy has increased the organic
sessions by 74% and Pages by per session
by 41% just by changing the site
architecture so you'd be surprised by
changing the site architecture what that
will do to engagement and so let's turn
our attention to secure versus
non-secure so what we mean by that is
securing your site we want to make it
sure that compliant with certain
protocols and so if we go back here we
could see that this particular
particular site is compliant it is
secure https means it has a secure
license meaning the site is secure so
Google likes secure versus non-secure so
non-secure would be HTTP so we want
https as our protocol and what that
means is just enabling SSL certificates
and that means when you enable an SSL
certificate that means your domain or
your protocol is going to be turned to
https so Google prefers sites that are
secure versus non-secure so if you use
hsts as a protocol that adds an extra
layer of security over the https and
hsts prevents cookie hijacking so adding
multiple layers of security always helps
in my opinion if you have an
HTTP website a non-secure website you
should look into buying an s SL
certificate getting your sites flipped
over to
https because what's going to happen is
your url structure is going to change
when your url structure changes Google's
going to recognize that because they're
going to index your site and when they
index your site they're going to see
those secur URLs and that's going to
work favorably in your favor and help
you rank higher on Google search so
websites using secure or
https have a higher chance of ranking
higher so https is a ranking signal
because Google indexes those pages so
let's also talk about sit Maps so
sitemap is one of the most important
ways to improve your website ranking why
well because sitemaps are a way to
organize all your URLs into one file so
we're basically going to prioritize all
our web pages in a sitemap so if you go
to any particular website and you type
in sitemap XML you're likely going to
see all the pages on your website so
usually the site map is located in the
root directory so if I type in
sitemap.xml I'm going to be able to see
all the pages in my root directory and I
can also prioritize them I can also
alert Google as to how often they change
and every page is going to have a date
stamp associated with it so Google can
actually see how often it changes so
remember we want our content to be
updated free frequently so if content is
not updated frequently or it's not fresh
then Google's going to see that s that
date stamp that last modification D so
we want to be able to make sure our
content's updated frequently we want to
let Google know that we changed it
frequently and we want to be able to
prioritize our Pages let Google know hey
these pages are important to us so all
that can be set up in a site map we want
to be able to add canonical versions of
URLs in the sitemap so we want to be
able to add all our original URLs in our
sit map and so we always want to build
Dynamic URLs sitemaps for larger
websites and what do I mean by Dynamic
URLs that means that if I look at this s
map and we're always adding content
let's just say in the form of a Blog
well guess what we want those pages to
be added to the sitemap as they're
published so as we add pages to the blog
or to the site then they should
automatically be added to the sitemap
and so in effect what's going to happen
is we're going to be able to see the
sitemap grow with more URLs when the
sitemap grows with more URLs then that
means then Google's going to index more
pages they're going to index more fresh
pages so they're going to be able to get
those pages that are just published
quicker so that's the whole idea behind
Dynamic sit Maps is we want to be able
to capture all the URLs just as they're
published and we want to be able to
maintain our site maps and so I would
always recommend a dynamic s map but you
can always create your own sit map just
by going to a tool called XML sitemap so
if I just type in XML sitemaps into
Google search here I can see XML sit
Maps generator and I can be able if I
have a small website just create a free
and simple sitemap on my own when XML
sitemaps creates it or your platform
creates a dynamic sit map either way the
site map's going to sit in the directory
and then what we want to do in turn is
let Google know where that sitemap is so
in search console we want to be able to
submit the sitemap so you're going to
add the sitemap you're going to let
Google know where it is it should be in
the root directory and it should be
called sitemap.xml and when you do that
Google's going to be able to take those
URLs and index them so we could see we
submitted 528 URLs Google index 521 so
one thing about URLs here is when we
create a site map we're putting all your
URLs in there we do not add no index
URLs in your sitemap and what that means
is that any URL we don't want Google to
index we're just going to exclude from
the sitemap okay so we want Google to
take all the URLs we want indexed and
put them in the sitemap so according to
edgy using S maps for SEO can increase
your website's visibility and help you
get indexed why because what you're in
fact doing is taking all your URLs that
you want index you're telling Google how
often they're modified you're telling
Google which ones are important and
you're submitting that to Google and so
Google's going to be able to take all
these URLs quicker index them quicker
and when they're index quicker you can
get ranked quicker and when you get
ranked quicker you can get traffic
quicker so that's the whole idea behind
sit Maps so let's turn our attention to
page speed now so when the last factors
for our website besides architecture
making it secure and adding site Maps is
want to take a look at how quick our
Pages load here are some tips in order
to optimize page speed because ideally
the quicker a page loads the more engag
the user is going to be if it takes a
longer time for the page to load all the
elements of that page then what's going
to happen is the user is going to get
impatient maybe leave the website all
together or go to another page and so so
we want to be able to optimize images so
any image that's of large size in terms
of megabytes we want to be able to
optimize that compress the image so
that's one way to speed up page speed we
want to use a simple website design you
know HTML with CSS or cascading
stylesheets just a simple design with
simple hierarchy and website navigation
structure so nothing fancy nothing
complex just a simple website design
with optimized images we want to
leverage browser caching and we want to
upgrade the server response time meaning
all your files are sitting on the server
so when somebody goes to a web page the
server is serving up all of those files
the images the text Etc and so we want
the server to respond as quick as
possible so when it comes to page speed
we can look at the factors affecting
page speed in Google analytics so if I
go to Google analytics and I go under
behavior and I go under sight speed and
I go to overview I'm going to be able to
see what my average load time is for my
site and ideally we want our pages to
load as quick as possible so that means
anything under 4 seconds anything 4
seconds or higher and it's likely the
end user is going to leave the page
there's a correlation between between
page load time and bounce rate and so
what Google actually does is give you
speed suggestions so if we do have a
page that loads slow we can just go to
speed suggestions in Google analytics
and we go to speed suggestions then
Google's going to be able to tell us hey
this particular page load fast this
particular page load slow and if it
loaded slow why is it loading slow so
here we could see the homepage as
example is loading on average of 7
Seconds well if we look here they're
going to give us some suggestions so if
I click on those page speed suggestions
it's going to load a report and a tool
called page speed insights and basically
what it's then going to do after it's
done running is it's going to tell me
all the ways in which I can optimize my
pages not only for desktop but also for
mobile so here I can see for desktop or
for mobile I can look at some ways in
which I can optimize it to increase page
speed for example sizing my images
properly server response time reducing
my server response time avoiding
multiple page redirects so there's a lot
of opportunities that we can do to speed
up page loow time and all that's found
in page speed insights and all that's
found within Google analytics so
remember optimizing code minimizing
redirects optimizing your images
upgrading your server respons all of
those are factors and so again you can
go into analytics page speed insights
and you can see exactly what go Google
is recognizing as what's lowering or
slowing down your page load time so
Google takes sight speed as one of the
most important ranking factors why
because they're going to rank Pages not
only with high quality content that are
relevant to the keyword queries but they
want those pages to have a good user
experience so if somebody clicks on the
page then the user should be able to see
that content fairly quickly and so
that's why it's such an important factor
so the quicker your pay is load the
chances of you ranking higher are going
to be better so according to web
performance today Walmart as an example
experienced Decline and conversions so
what they did was looked at their page
speed and when they looked at their page
speed you'd be surprised what that did
just increasing it from 1 to 4 seconds
or decreasing it basically increased
conversion so there's always going to be
a correlation between how quick a page
loads and how engaged the user is
because if it's users engaged they're
going to stay on the site and if they
stay on the site then their chances of
converting are going to be higher so
just even one to two seconds increase in
page low low time will make a world of
difference in terms of Engagement and
conversions let's turn our attention to
offsite engagement so previously we
talked about onpage elements and website
factors that affect our rankings for
search results but we also need to turn
our attention away from our website
meaning what we do on our website and
turn our attention what we can do for
our website off our website and onto
other websites so that's offsite
engagement and so let's look at an
example so that ice cream recipes blog
I'm going to talk about how to rank
YouTube videos today so it's simply
learn we take our videos on YouTube very
seriously I meaning that when we create
videos we want people to see them
because we know we make good videos and
we know we have good content and we know
that our audience is going to enjoy it
and so we want our audience to see the
videos that we're creating and so we're
going to give you some tips and tricks
and methodology and ideas on how to get
your videos to rank on YouTube so at
simply learn if I go to YouTube and I
just type in machine learning you could
see we're right here is the first
organic video on YouTube for machine
learning if I jump over to Google and I
type in machine learning Basics you can
see we're number we're number one for
machine learning Basics under videos if
I click on all we're also ranked here as
well under the video section on organic
search results another example data
science for beginners we ranked number
one for that if I look at another
keyword data science interview questions
okay we'll rank number two for that so
we're ranking for a lot of videos and
why are we ranking for a lot of
different content and videos on Google
Search and on YouTube well we put a lot
of work in behind the scenes of creating
the video and that's what we want to
show you so part of that has a lot to do
with you know how our audience engages
and sees our video so for example we're
looking at the machine learning Basics
video here and we could see that it has
over
221,000 subscribers for this video
234,000 views we've had over 2,000
people like the video and we have had
over 270 plus comment on the video so
when we get our videos to rank then we
can see there's a lot of Engagement and
so that's the whole idea is when you do
a video and you want to show up on
YouTube you want people to enjoy it you
want people to share it you want people
to like it you want people to comment on
it and that's part of the whole
ecosystem of YouTube It's you know we're
going to show you behind the scenes of
what it takes to get your videos to rank
and then we're going to show you some of
the metrics involved with some of these
videos to help you stay ranking so
without further Ado let's go into how to
get your videos to rank on YouTube so
we're going to talk about keyword
research for YouTube we're going to talk
about some ways to create high quality
videos so the importance of user
engagement just as I showed you with the
machine learning Basics video all the
shares all the commenting all the views
and subscriptions then we're going to
get into how to promote your content and
then we're going to just review a little
checklist for you and some all up so
let's get started with keyword research
so basically what we want to do is
Center our keywords just like our
website we want to Center our keywords
around or our content around good
keywords so the videos on YouTube are no
different than the web pages on our
website so if we have somebody who
states YouTube is the world's second
most well well-known engine well it is
because it's right behind Google it's
not a search engine per se it's a video
platform but if it was a search engine
it'd probably be second right behind
Google so YouTube is pretty popular
majority people use YouTube search every
day to watch videos on a number of
different topics so they can find these
videos in Google but because YouTube's
so powerful and so popular people go
directly right into YouTube for their
searches and so the whole idea behind
YouTube being the second most well-known
search engine is centered around
keywords so if you have the right
keywords for your video then the chances
of you ranking higher increases on
YouTube so we're going to share with you
a few easy ways to do keyword research
this is the most important step in
getting your videos to rank on YouTube
just like for those of you who watched
any of the SEO videos we produced at at
simply learn you know that keyword
research is so essential to getting your
web pages to rank on Google well it's no
different keyword research and choosing
the right keywords is just as important
for your videos as is for your web pages
so we're going to go into a few things
to do here to find the right keywords so
we have the search suggestion you can
look at your competitors we have
different tools we can use some other
factors involved in Google itself so
let's start talking about some of these
ways to really hone in and do some good
research on your keywords to align them
with your videos so first thing is
search suggest so YouTube has a feature
called autocomplete so if you've done
any searches on Google it's very similar
if you're typing something in to YouTube
search then YouTube is going to suggest
other related popular keywords so let's
take a look at that if we go back to
YouTube for a second and I just type in
machine learning YouTube is going to
populate on the autocomplete in the
search bar some other popular keywords
that we can potentially use or in this
case if I Choose You Know machine
learning tutorial I'm going to see a
video about machine learning tutorial so
here you can see simply learns rank
number one for machine learning tutorial
but there are other videos that show up
in my search results so we want to be
able to use the search suggestion box in
the search box field so when we're
typing in something you know YouTube
just like on Google is going to give us
those suggestions so if we're focusing
uh a video on machine learning then you
know we have some ideas of some other
key wordss that we could center around
because these are our popular key wordss
these are keywords that people are using
to search on YouTube so that's one
suggestion looking at competitors is
another suggestion so we could search
for key words used by our competitors in
their video title and description so let
me talk a little bit about that what you
want to do is you want to go to that
particular channel of your competitor so
when you go to your particular
competitor YouTube channel you want to
be able to click on the videos tab when
you click on the videos tab then you're
going to sort by most popular and then
what you could do is see a list of
videos and then when you look at a list
of videos you're going to choose a video
and then what you're going to do then is
take a look at the keywords used in the
title and description and then once you
do that you're going to have a list of
keywords that you can use yourself for
that video so for example let's go back
to YouTube so if I go to type in simply
learn here's her Channel page just by
clicking on simply learn I click on
videos ever wonder if there's so now I
can see all the videos ever wonder if
there's an easier way go back so here I
can see all the videos sort by most
popular once they do that then I can
choose a video this is the most popular
video right now for simply learn if I
click on that video it's automatically
going to start playing but what I could
do is simply just look at you know the
content description so so just by
clicking show more I can see all the
content that align with this video
that's one way to do it is simply by
looking at your competitors now what you
could also do is look at the tags
associated with the particular video and
so what you want to do is you want to
look at the HTML and so that means
looking at the page source so just like
web pages what YouTube does is they look
at metatext so if you're call from SEO
in order to get your pages to rank you
need to have a title tag and a meta tag
description so videos are no different
what we're doing uh for YouTube is
aligning certain keywords with the video
so if you take a look and do a search
for keywords by viewing the page Source
you're going to see all the keywords
associated with a particular video so
for example if I go back to YouTube and
I look at the page source of a video
Let's just say this video here
Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull
up the page source and all I need to do
isrl F and type in keywords and now for
that Facebook video I can see all the
keywords associated with the video so
you can see there's a lot of different
keywords we're aligning with this video
and so why do we want to do that because
we want you know our video to show up
for keywords that people may type in and
so if we use that YouTube autocomplete
it's going to give you those ideas as
most popular keywords so if they're
related a l find those keywords with the
video so here you can see Facebook
marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook
ads for beginners so forth and so on so
there's a lot of keywords we've aligned
here with that particular video and
again all you need to do is look at the
page source so right clicking view page
Source do a contrl f for keywords and
you'll be able to see the keywords
aligned so you could do that for your
competitor's videos as well so you can
see what keywords your competitor is
using for a video that's most popular
for their Channel and is also ranking on
YouTube and on Google so using the auto
complete gives you those keyword ideas
looking at your competitor's videos also
gives you some other ideas for keywords
that you can align with a video that's
relevant that you want to rank for so
let's look at uh some other ideas here
so you can install plugins and there are
plenty of plugins available on the
Chrome browser that will help you you
see the video tags associated with a
particular video so a couple of examples
are vid IQ and Tu budy those are
extensions that work in Chrome and what
they do is they give you the exact tags
that a particular video is using so for
example if I go back here and I look at
a video on YouTube let's just say the
machine learning Basics video I have vid
IQ installed on my Chrome browser so
just by clicking on that vid IQ is going
to give me a lot of information about
that video they're just going to give me
an overview of their particular metrics
they're going to give me some other
information associated with Facebook
some engagement metrics really what I'm
interested in is those keywords so if I
scroll down a bit here I can see the
video tags associated with the machine
learning Basics video so vid IQ is
telling me is these keywords are
associated with this video and not only
does it show me what keywords are
Associated I can also see where they
rank so for machine learning Basics this
particular video ranks number one if I
go down I could see what is machine
learning and how does it work I can see
it's rank number two here I could see
machine learning algorithms it's rank
number nine so I can get some ideas of
the types of keywords that are being
used as tags for that video further down
I can also see some Channel tags but
really this is the video tags or the
idea place I want to be able to look to
get an idea of the types of keywords
that are associated with the video that
are also ranking or not ranking so
that's another way for you to really get
an understanding of what key words to
use at the particular video so
autocomplete you can look at the page
source of a competitor's video or you
can use a Chrome extension in this case
I'm using vid IQ to give me some
information about the video tags for
particular video so according to an
industry study using keywords and video
tags will help you rank well on YouTube
so you have to use keywords and video
tags if you want your video to rank
there's been a lot of studies YouTube is
so popular and videos are so prominent
in today's world where if you have
videos and you're going to upload it's
going to be engaged then associate the
right keywords with those videos so some
important factors when we look at
keywords what we want to do is look at
search vol we want to look at
competition we want to look at relevancy
we want to look at the primary and
secondary keywords that we want to use
so well-chosen keywords will help you
rank so we just gave you some ideas on
how to do some keyword research again
those ideas were really to use the
autocomplete on YouTube or Google
they're going to give you some popular
keywords you can look what your
competitors are doing by looking at the
page source and just looking at the
keywords that are aligned with that
video or you can use a third- party
extension in Chrome in my example I use
vid IQ that gave me the keywords
associated with that video so you have
ways to get the keywords so what we want
to do is we want to make sure we choose
keywords with high search volume they're
going to drive more traffic to your
video however we want to balance it out
with keywords that have low difficulty
and are easier to rank for so you don't
want to choose something very broad
that's just going to be very difficult
to rank for and of course we always want
to go with relevancy so if we're talking
about machine learning Basics then we
want to choose keywords associated with
that and that's where that autocomplete
comes in handy because what Google's
going to do and YouTube's going to do is
give us keywords that are very closely
related to the video that we're trying
to optimize for and so we have a number
of different keywords at our disposal
that are relevant that we can look to
see if they have good volume and low
competition and so the whole idea is we
want to choose a keyword that defines
the nature of the content and then what
we want to do is support that with
secondary keywords so we want keywords
that are highly relevant to the primary
keyword so that's the way to go about
aligning your keywords you want keywords
that are high volume low competition or
relevant and you want to choose that one
keyword that is really what the content
about and then those secondary keywords
that support the primary so if you have
a machine learning video you could
choose your primary keyword as in this
case the machine learning Basics video
so well chosen keywords help you rank
well on YouTube just like the machine
learning Basics so if I go back to our
video our machine learning Basics video
if I just type in machine learning
Basics I'll be able to pull it up and so
here it is if I click on it I'm going to
go to YouTube and so here I can see this
keyword we know humans learn from their
is well aligned because it's in the
title it's in the copy
and it's aligned as a keyword tagged
with the video so we know that that
keyword has good volume low competition
is relevant because that's what the
video is about the basics of machine
learning it's an introduction to machine
learning so instead of honing in on just
introduction to M machine learning
primary keyword is machine learning
Basics and then we supported that video
with those secondary keywords what is
machine learning because somebody who
doesn't know what machine learning is
probably going to type in that keyword
and then introduction of machine
learning is a good secondary keyword
because it's explaining the basics of
what machine learning is all about so
primary keyword machine learning basic
secondary keywords what is machine
learning and introduction to machine
learning so that's the whole idea behind
choosing keywords you want that keyword
that really is going to define the
content and then support that with those
secondary keywords so remember when
you're performing your keyword research
choose keywords for your videos Google
shows on the video results page so what
I mean by that is your video can get
more views if you rank on Google as well
so the whole idea is not necessarily to
be found on YouTube it's also to be
found on Google so if I go back to
Google and I just type in data science
for beginners and I type in videos then
you could see we're ranked number one so
even if you're not looking at the videos
clicking on the videos link on Google
search you can always just when you do a
search what Google's going to do is is
also put in the videos here on part as
part of the search results so what
they're going to show you is the top
videos that are ranking for that
particular keyword and so we may not
rank overall for data science for
beginners but we're ranked number one in
the videos category and so if somebody's
looking for a video that's important and
you can see here that these first two
are ads so what Google is doing is
they're saying hey this is so relevant
this particular video for the keyword
query d science for beginners that we're
going to show it above the organic
listings even though it's a video so the
whole idea is to be found on YouTube and
Google because you're increasing your
visibility you're increasing your
chances of getting found on both search
platforms so according to backlinko
google Ranks videos with keywords like
how to tutorials so you know a lot of
the videos that you find on YouTube are
going to be instructional based and so
what Google's doing is they're saying
hey if somebody types in how to or a
tutorial or an introduction to anything
that's going to signal to Google that
it's instructional it's going to help
you rank so when you search for machine
learning tutorial or how to become a
machine learning engineer you're going
to get results related to that because
if you look at these examples we have
machine learning tutorial in our title
or how to become a machine learning
engineer so keep that in mind if you're
creating a video and it's educational in
nature you know use those key terms like
how to and tutorials in the video title
because that will help you rank so let's
move over now to video title so we want
to use our Target keyword in the title
of the video and again we want to make
sure if it's educational to include that
keyword tutorial or how to so for every
video title YouTube has a limit of 100
characters so we really have to pick and
choose really wisely so if we look at
the video that we were focusing on a
couple of minutes ago so machine
learning Basics here we could see under
100 characters we have machine learning
Basics what is machine learning
introduction to machine learning and
then the brand name so that is the title
of this particular video so takes into
account the primary keyword the
secondary keywords and the title and it
also includes that really that key term
that really Google and YouTube like and
that's what is machine learning so it's
helping us Rank by having our keywords
in the title with that key phrase what
is okay so that's a a good tidbit on
creating a good video title is to align
it with the right keywords your primary
and your secondary and so we want to use
those catchy words and numbers to gain
High click through R just like you would
on the title tag of your web page we
want to do the same name with our video
title because the video title is what's
going to show up in search so if I go
back to you know search here we could
see you know data science tutorial data
science for beginners so we want to make
sure in this case you can see data
science in 5 minutes so that was
purposely done so that hey I don't have
time to watch a video I only have a
couple minutes data science and 5
minutes okay great I'm going to click on
the video and now I have an opportunity
to watch something and learn something
under five minutes so choosing the right
words in your video title is going to
help you get that clickthrough rate up
remember clickthrough rate is clicks
divided by Impressions and an impression
is how many times your video shows up in
the search results on YouTube or Google
so we want to keep our click theough
rate high and in order to do that we
want to be able to write some really
good title tags for our video so use
catchy words like a number or how to or
what is cuz that's going to reson with
people when they're searching now for
the description what we want to do is we
want to use the target word at the
beginning of the description the title
and the tags itself so if I go back to
my video here machine learning Basics we
know it's in the video title and right
off the bat if I look at the description
of the video here I can see this machine
learning Basics video will help you
understand what is machine learning so
our primary keyword is in the first
sentence right in the introductory of
the description and so that's going to
bode well for optimizing our video the
description length is 5,000 characters
so we have a lot of characters to work
with so if I go back to my video I click
show more we have a lot of characters to
really describe what the video is about
okay there's no shortage no shortage of
including keywords into the content so
you have 5,000 characters go ahead and
see if you can work in naturally your
keywords but one of the key tips here is
just make sure that first sentence
starts out with that keyword that's a
good tip of course you always want to
make it sound natural as possible you
don't want to stuff it with keywords at
the same time work them in naturally
work in your keywords naturally and then
include hashtags in your description to
help the audience find your video is
easily so if I go back here you know we
want to be able to include hashtags so
hashtags it's like anything else you
would use on social media it just
signals to the end user hey this is what
the video is all about and if I go ahead
and type in that keyword then it's our
video has a better chance CU it's
aligned with that hashtag and then
there's Target keywords and LSI keywords
latent semantic indexing keywords we
want to be able to use those keywords as
Target keywords with our video so if you
recall the example I gave a few minutes
ago we used the face Facebook ads
tutorial as our example here I can see
all the target keywords associated with
that particular video so don't be afraid
to use those LSI related keywords
meaning keywords that are related to the
content use them as Target keywords with
the video so between your LSI keywords
Target keywords and then using our
primary and secondary keyword in the
title tag using our primary and
secondary keyword in the description and
then using hashtags in the description
the combination of all of that if we
chose the right keyword then we should
find that our video will eventually rank
on YouTube so just doing these small
tidbits with our keywords really help
get our video to rank so at the end of
the day we want to be able to use the
tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
looking at our competitors those
extensions like vid IQ the auto complete
to really find our good keywords and
then incorporating those keywords into
you know the title tag the description
as Target keywords hashtags we should
really be off and running with our video
on YouTube let's turn our attention to
creating high quality videos and some of
the best practices around that so along
with everything we mentioned about
choosing the right keywords we always
need to keep in mind that the videos we
create need to be of high quality so the
content cont itself in addition to the
keywords is a primary factor in ranking
so in order to have keywords we need to
have content and in order to rank we
need to have you know good content so
let's talk a little bit about creating
content and what's involved with that
and what we really mean by high quality
videos so if you have a video content
that is not informative or IR relevant
to the topic it won't rank so that's
just common sense so you need to create
content that's align with the topic
obviously and then that way you have
keywords that are align with the content
so but if you have content really isn't
align with the topic then you're not
going to rank no matter how much you've
optimized that video so just keep that
in mind so there's a couple of things we
want to look at here so high quality
content is determined by really two
metrics so we're not sure about how good
our content is and how good of high
quality video created we want to look at
audience retention and user engagement
so audience retention is simply the
percentage length of your video that the
audience has watched It's the percentage
your audience has watched so focusing on
audience retention is important for
people who want their videos to rank
high so if you want to rank you need to
optimize for the key words but got to
keep in mind content so content is
related to audience retention and user
engagement so audience ret retention
percentage length your video of your
video that the audience has watched and
for example it can be both absolute in
minutes or percentages so audience
retention can be the average view
duration or percentage of the audience
that watched then we have user
engagement so user engagement are
viewers who are engaged with your
content and so that means they're either
sharing it subscribing commenting or
liking so those are all forms of
Engagement so the percentage of users
who watched or how long they watched
versus engagement or in combination with
engagement are two factors for ranking
so let's talk about some tips for
creating high quality videos so we want
to publish longer videos and so what do
we mean behind longer videos so what's
the reason for longer videos let's just
suppose we have two videos one shorter
in length and one longer in length the
first video is 15 minutes long the
second video is 7 minutes long so on
average if viewers watch about 40% of
both videos then video x which is 15
minutes long will have more than twice
the watch time of the video that's 7
minutes long so remember duration we
want you know people to watch our videos
longer so if the video is longer in
length if it's 40% then it's going to
have a longer audience engagement
audience retention so that's one of the
reasons you know from a metric
standpoint so even when viewers watch
you know both videos the time is going
to differ so we want to take into
account longer videos for primarily that
reason is because you know it gives an
an end user an opportunity to watch the
video longer and then it's going to help
us rank our videos longer so we talk
about watch time so if one video has
higher watch time than the other watch
time is just the number of views times
the average VI view duration so another
tip is we want to plan our video script
so we want to keep the content organized
my recommendation is you know create an
outline first and once you create an
outline of how the video is going to
flow then start populating with content
and so to me that's how you can keep the
flow organized okay is is really with an
outline starting out with an outline
there no videos are no different than
say a presentation if you've done a
PowerPoint presentation you always want
to start out doing an outline and then
we want to upload high resolution videos
high resolution we don't want to create
videos that you know a small resolution
like say you know 400 by 400 resolution
or some you know something really small
we want to create something a very high
res so according to back or link Oak
more than 50% of videos on the first
page of YouTube are high definition so
high definition videos of higher quality
are going to be shown on the first page
of YouTube more often than not so high
resolution videos organizing the content
publishing longer videos are examples of
creating high quality videos we also
want to make sure that content is
relevant to the title so if we're
talking about machine learning Basics
you know obviously the content is going
to be about you know intro to machine
learning or what is machine learning and
then the title should reflect that
content so aligning the title sets the
expectation for the end user so when
they see a title what is machine
learning then when they watch the video
they're expecting to learn about machine
learning and what it is so if it meets
expectations then the chances are that
person who's watching the video is going
to watch it longer and that means it's
going to fulfill the viewers
requirements when you align everything
accordingly keywords titles content then
at the end of the day the view user is
going to watch it and the more they
watch it the higher the engagement the
higher the engagement the better chance
you have to rank some other tips that
you could use to create high quality
videos so we want to be able to you know
use examples to clarify our content so
you know don't be afraid to go into
another screen like I am I want to I'm
talking about videos jump into the
machine learning Basics video which I've
done throughout this session I can
simply do that by keeping the user
engaged here this video is about machine
learning basics well the title is align
with the video we made sure that we have
a nice description about what the video
is about and we're aligning the
expectations so not only that I'm
showing you example within the video
itself so we want to use examples
throughout your video to keep the user
engaged it will also help clarify what
you're trying to express in the video
itself so we want to make it visually
appealing so visually appealing means
imagery or example in the video and then
when we talk about imagery you know you
want to use good images in your video so
use public domain sites that are
available to you like shutter stock or
flat icon I mean there are plenty of
those sites out there so feel free to
use any one of those sites to use high
quality images in your video give more
information to your audience okay giving
maximum relevant information can help
gain more views and so when we talk
about more information again goes back
to you know the examples you use there's
no should be no shortage of examples
here description use all 5,000
characters at your disposal imagery we
want to build up as much information as
you can in the video itself to keep the
end user the view or engaged we also
want to create original content so
always create original content you could
certainly get ideas from YouTube if
you're want to create a video about
machine learning see what else has
already been done do searches on YouTube
itself but but you know when you going
to create a video yeah you can create
another video about what is machine
learning but just make sure it has your
own take on it you're the subject matter
expert when creating the video create it
with your own original content have high
audio quality and video effects so just
like you see here on this video we have
effects in it and the audio is of high
quality meaning no background noise no
Distortion and we want to be able to
speak clearly in the video so we want to
speak clear clearly loudly concise just
as I'm trying to do now so that you can
understand what I'm trying to say or
what the viewer trying to to understand
when they're watching the video so
watching and listening are two of the
components and you want to make sure
both of are high quality avoid
distractions we don't want to pause you
don't want to ramble on a particular
Point too long we want to keep users
engaged so you always want to move from
one point to the other intermix it with
examples those are ways to to keep the
users engaged we won't include
transcripts or subtitles for your video
so transcripts is just more content
that's aligned with the video and the
search engines will be able to pick up
that content and help your video rank so
to me that's a key component to creating
a good video is having the necessary
content go along with the video that
outline I referenced earlier in terms of
organization you always want to have a
Content outline so what topics are you
going to cover in the the video that's
why you need the outline to point that
out confirm that before you actually
start creating the video okay focus on
the initial 15 seconds so that's key you
know somebody's going to click the play
button of your video and if you don't
catch them in the first 15 seconds then
they're likely going to pause the video
or just go ahead and close it out all
together so you want to be able to
capture somebody's attention right off
the bat and even before they click on
that play button you want to make sure
again you're exceeding expect
that title is aligned with the content
so in your first 15 seconds it basically
needs to be catchy but also setting the
expectation of what the user is
expecting so in this example here we
want to pay close attention to the first
15 seconds that's when viewers are most
likely to drop off so we can look at
audience retention in YouTube so use the
options above the graph to view absolute
audience retention or relative audience
retention so audience ret attention is
basically how many views a video
received and the percentage of the total
number of video views and that includes
every moment of the video as a
percentage so we'll show you an example
of what that looks like so here if we go
to the machine learning Basics video we
can look at the audience retention
report and this is since it's been
uploaded the lifetime audience retention
so here we can see a nice graph the
percentage of people who viewed it and
how long they viewed it so in percentage
so here for example I can see you know
43
44% watch the video for at least 2
minutes here I can see
28.6% was it for 6 minutes plus so
that's the audience retention it gives
us an idea in terms of percentage how
many people or percentage of people
watch the video at what length so that's
audience retention so we want to keep
that number high at the very initial
stage of the video and we want to keep
it high throughout and that's why you
always want to create high quality
content using those examples using
imagery making it organized content not
pausing you know going from one point to
the other those are all best practices
to keep the viewer engaged and then we
want to add resources from well-known
sites so throughout this video we've
used back linkco there are other sources
we've used so if you have a source go
ahead and put it in your video to add
credibility and then we want to use
cards to your videos so this cards is
basically a feature that recommends
relevant videos to your audience so in
addition to machine learning Basics
there could be other videos about
machine learning that we can recommend
or YouTube can recommend to the audience
to set up end screens you want to make
sure that with end screens you can use
relevant videos to your audience towards
the end of your video so you can
recommend relevant videos towards the
end of your video you can also create
playlist so this is a feature that keeps
your audience engaged with relevant
content by autop playing the next video
so if you enable this feature it's going
to go from one video to another pattern
interrupts keep the audience engaged so
basically it allows your audience to
stay within one video without having any
interruptions involved and so going back
to the did you know audience retention
report helps you analyze how well your
videos are engaging to the audience so
what do we mean by that well if I go
back again to my audience retention
report how engaging was it well I could
see 42% 43% watched it on average of 3
minutes and 21 seconds so to me that's
pretty good of course we always want
100% of the video if the video is 7
minutes long if almost half of our
audience saw over half of the video then
I would say that's pretty good people
were engaged so audience retention just
is a good report to start looking at to
help you understand how engaging is my
video and if your video is not engaging
you know you can always go back and edit
it or fix it or tweak it so remember the
average view duration for all videos and
top performing videos listed by all time
we can look at that information as well
in addition we can look at demographics
so we can get an overview of the age
gender and location and we can look at
playback locations report and what the
playback locations report does is it
helps us determine the platforms where
our videos are being streamed from
within YouTube look at the traffic
sources where did the viewers come from
devices did they look on mobile or
tablet and so there's any doubts you
know if you have any questions please
drop a comment below but especially if
you have any doubts on the metrics so if
we go back into YouTube we can look at
analytics and if we're looking at
analytics we can see more and then this
is going to show us everything we need
to see from device type so if I click on
more I can see my playback location
so this will show me where the video was
watched it was on a watch page or a
channel page I can see the traffic
sources I can see the gender and age so
if I click on the viewer age report I
can see the percentage of views by age
so I can get a lot of
information about my video and how it's
performed who's watched it what they've
done with it where they come from all
the information they need to know and so
it's all within YouTube analytics so
again if you have any questions about
that you know just drop a comment below
especially if you're new to YouTube you
may have some questions but just know
that every video you publish to YouTube
high quality aligned with your keywords
you're going to be able to view the
metrics by looking at YouTube analytics
so let's talk about the importance of
user engagement so engagement is as we
mentioned important because basically we
can't rank without engagement our videos
won't rank unless we have engagement so
that's why it's important so engagement
is somebody liking the video commenting
sharing it or subscribing each one of
these is important to ranking so yes you
need to line keywords yes you need to
have high quality content so when you do
both of those and you upload your video
then it's up to the viewer and so the
hard work that you put out for the video
is hopefully going to pay dividends with
engagement so you want people to do one
of these for okay so let's talk about
what that means so how do I get
engagement so we already talked about
creating engaging content so there are a
lot of tips to creating engaging content
and so according to wordstream if your
content is entertaining then over 3/4 of
the users are going to share it so
that's part of keeping uh uh users
engage is keeping it entertaining is
part of getting a high quality video so
remember on the high quality video when
we say entertaining the audio portion
has a lot to do with it examples has a
lot to do with it quality of the video
itself has a lot to do with it so a lot
of components so all those components on
a high quality video are going to lead
to engagement so parts of what you could
do in your videos is conduct a quiz so
meaning the quiz itself is a way to keep
people engaged in your video so that
also help you get some more comments so
according to back linku video comments
help in ranking your video higher so
just as I mentioned in the last segment
about you YouTube analytics and all the
different reports available on YouTube
hey if you have questions on those just
go ahead and add a comment so that's a
way to entice your users or your viewers
to add comments is if they have
questions because you know with videos
you're not going to be able to cover
every detail or every minute detail
about a particular topic you can only
cover in some cases the topic at a high
level so users are going to have
comments or questions naturally and so
the comment section is a good way to
remind viewers hey if you have a
question or comment go ahead and put it
in the comment section because that will
lend to engagement as well so we want to
add sources from high quality websites
that'll help with engagement okay use
humor in your video we want to be able
to basically you know make it human
based we don't want want to be robots so
we want to be able to sound like you
know we know what we're talking about
but at the same time talk to the viewer
not necessarily at the viewer or looking
the other way and just going through the
motions so adding humor adding
personality never hurts at the end of
the day we are all human adding that
clear call to action at the end of the
video will also lead to engagement so if
we win the video with hey leave your
comments on this video or hey feel free
to share this video with colleagues who
are interested then that's a call to
action that's likely going to lead to
more engagement reply to your comments
as well so if you have comments we
always want to reply to them likely
those comments are going to be questions
because again as I mentioned even in
this video about how to rank your videos
on YouTube okay there's a lot of
information and a lot of information
sometimes doesn't get covered in its
entirety and so we want to make sure
that if we miss something cuz we're only
human that we're able to respond in the
form of an answer to a question that
somebody leaves in the comment section
so more comments also lead to higher
rankings because it's engagement so when
you're getting high engagement and your
video starts to rank well you know
you're going to start feeling really
good and what is that going to do okay
that feel good is going to lead to
confidence which in turn is going to
probably lead to more videos and that's
exactly what we do at simply learn and
we're in the education business but
we're in it to not only educate okay but
making sure that our videos are shown to
as many people as possible so that we
can educate as many people as possible
so it's all it's contagious so getting
ranked feels good and then once you get
ranked then you know you probably have
good engagement okay let's talk about
how to promote your content so once
you've done all the hard work getting
your video done high quality content
optimized with keywords and then
published to YouTube we want to let
everybody in the world know about it
right right so we want to promote it
done all the work we want to promote it
now so is it necessary to promote it I
would say yes because once your video is
published you want to reach out you want
to reach out to your audience not
necessarily on YouTube but on different
platforms so if you're active on
Facebook or Twitter that's an
opportunity for you to post or tweet
something about the new video so when we
say different platforms I am talking
about you know social media platforms so
depends on what you're active on so if
you're active on Facebook yeah go ahead
and post something you're active on
Twitter go ahead and tweet something it
could be you know on LinkedIn group if
you're part of a LinkedIn group about
you know machine learning then go ahead
and post something to that group to
promote the video so that's going to
help Drive traffic to the video and then
help with engagement so we want to
engage with our audience on those social
media sites so really depends on what
you're active on so if you have a large
following on Twitter then go ahead and
you know share that YouTube video link
on Twitter with the Tweet that's going
to drive traffic from Twitter to YouTube
Remember You know you're going to be
able to see audience engagement or
retention by getting people to watch the
video so you're going to be able to see
right away by promoting the video and
driving traffic to the video how
engaging it is remember the more people
you have watched the video the more
engaging it becomes the better it's
going to rank so it's an ecosystem and
promoting your content is part of that
ecosystem so it all starts with social
media if you're active on whatever
platform that is go ahead and promote it
so you can also look at you know content
based social media sites or social media
content based platforms like Reddit or
flicker for example so you can
participate in a form discussion on
Reddit so and this example here it's
about machine learning so we want to be
able to post something about machine
learning with the link to our video so
we can also go to content based sites
that are Q&A uh related like Kora for
example Kora is a really good site where
you know if you go there post
information about machine learning or
the basics of machine learning with the
link back to the video it's going to
help because not only is it going to
drive traffic but it's going to signal
to Google hey a lot of traffic coming
from cor this is going to bode well for
this video in terms of ranking so here's
an example you know if you find a
question that you can post on Cor then
you're going to get people to click on
your video and respond accordingly on
Cor or you can act as the person
responding to a question that's already
there so if somebody already asked a
question about what is machine learning
you can respond with your video as the
answer so you can just simply embed your
video URL as part of your answer that'll
help Drive traffic so you can also
create your own blog and embed your
videos so in the case of machine
learning here we have an example machine
learning what is it why it matters so
this goes nicely with the video so here
you can see the person the author of
this blog went ahead and embedded the
relevant video in the blog post so they
play off one another nicely you can also
opt in for influencer marking meaning
hey you can reach out to somebody in
this example here you know KD nuggets
posted information about machine
learning so in this case why choose
machine learning as a career well they
got information and then what do they do
they went ahead and embedded the video
about machine learning Basics and so
working with you know influencers in a
particular category or topic will help
Drive traffic to the video you can also
create a YouTube playlist so playlists
tend to rank high in YouTube searches so
if you find yourself doing a lot of
videos well go ahead and you know go to
your channel and simply in your channel
you can go ahead and create playlist so
when you create playlist basically what
you're doing is you're organizing the
content into different playlists no
different than say the music you have
set up on your you know your iPhone or
iPad or or iPod whatever it is you're
using so you're just creating different
videos in a particular category and it
YouTube likes it it's organized it's
going to help you get your videos found
quicker and easier on YouTube Itself by
putting your videos in a playlist so
here you could see we have entire
playlist on machine learning trending
Technologies cloud computing Big Data
digital marketing project management so
a lot of different playlists very
organized if somebody goes to the
channel they going to be able to go to
the playlist that's interesting to them
and see all the videos there so it
allows not only the end user to find
what they're looking for but it's good
for YouTube because YouTube likes those
playlists so we want to engage our
Audience by posting your video link on a
community page so you could do that
within YouTube and you can prefer to
link your YouTube channel in your email
so you can also do that so for example
if I go back to YouTube and I'm looking
at a YouTube video you know I can always
Click Share so here I'm going to get a
particular URL that's associated with
the video and I can just embed that so I
can embed the whole thing in my email I
can embed it on a web page or a blog
post so just by click can share I can
also immediately share it onto the
social media platforms that we mentioned
Facebook LinkedIn Reddit okay Tumblr so
there's a lot of ways to embed the video
not just down a blog post or influencer
blog post but in our email and on social
media as well so here's an example of
what we can do with a YouTube discussion
so we can also bookmark the video on a
popular bookmarking site you know like
stumbled upon or Reddit or you know
there's lots of other ones out there so
there's plenty of sites that you'll be
able to go to and bookmark that content
so that people can find it and you can
always opt for back blink so that means
that hey if there's a blogger out there
that blogs about machine learning you
can always you know ask that blogger to
create a link back to the video and you
could reciprocate do the same thing so
that helps increase the authority of the
video so there's a lot of things you can
do to promote your video so let's do a a
quick review on everything we talked
about in terms of ranking your video on
YouTube it all starts with the keywords
so we want to identify a list of
keywords that are relevant to the video
so we can use tools to choose our
keywords but remember we want to choose
keywords that have high volume and low
competition and so where can we go to
choose those keywords well we can use
the autocomplete on YouTube we could
check out our own competitor
videos or you know we could use vid IQ
or Tu budy or any of these extensions in
Chrome to help us look at the keywords
that are tagged with a particular video
so remember we want to have a primary
keyword that's aligned with the content
then we want to choose LSI keywords as
our secondary keyword or keywords that
are related to the primary keyword so we
want to create high retention videos
meaning that first 15 seconds are the
most important but throughout the video
we we want to use examples we want to
keep it interacting by adding quizzes
imagery good audio good video quality so
we want to focus on the user experience
and we also want to optimize our video
content what do that mean well those
keywords that we chose we want to use
them in the title we want to use them in
the description we want to use them as
hashtags we want to use them and tag
them with the video themselves so we can
add keywords to our metatag okay we
don't want to overdo it but we want to
add a hand handful of keywords that are
associated with the video so we want to
be able to write I catchy video titled
and descriptions so remember use some of
those key phrases like a number or a
question like what is machine learning
so we want to use relevant meta tags for
the videos and we want to use popular
YouTube tags so we want to be able to
tag our videos appropriately so watch
the length of your meta tags so there
are lengths involved remember keywords
at the beginning of the title Target
keywords in the title description and
tags we want to use interesting
thumbnails to increase our click the
rate ensure that thumbnails are relevant
meaning when I say thumbnails I mean the
actual title tag itself or The Meta
description we want to use highres
videos we want to create you know videos
with good high audio quality don't be
afraid to put in video effects like some
animation don't be afraid to use
examples and then you know obviously
look at the draft of the video before
you publish it so does your video follow
an outline is it organized so these are
all the things to take into account and
there's there's plenty more you can do
you know you remember once you create
and optimize that video you want to
promote it you want to make sure that
you're sharing it on social media you
create a complimentary blog you know
generate backlinks from say other blog
posts so there lots of things you can do
to promote your video so before you
promote it you want to organize the
content create good quality content
align it with keywords once you publish
it you know keep organizing it by
creating those playlist and then reach
out on social reach out on different
communities related to the topic and all
those things combined will help you to
get your YouTube video ranked we're
going to talk about how to increase
YouTube subscribers so with YouTube It's
All About subscribers the number of
subscribers you have on YouTube it's
just one of the key metrics to measure
success so gaining more subscribers can
help you achieve more view counts on
your YouTube videos so it's all about
how to get subscribers and today we're
going to talk about how to get more
subscribers and before we begin let's
just show you what we did at simply
learn so if we look at the past 365 days
on our YouTube channel you can see we
started here back in uh if we look back
at March 9th 2018 we had 208 and you
could see just over the course of the
year it kept creeping up creeping
creeping up creeping up and creeping up
we've gained you know a significant
number of subscribers over the last year
and what's our secret well it's posting
videos so you can see we've posted a
number of videos over the course of the
year and then our subscribers have gone
basically
165% over the last year so you can see
it's part of it is about posting videos
because when you post videos you have
people who can watch those videos when
you have people watch those videos you
can have engagement and then when you
have engagement you have shares and
people who like it and then other people
who see it so it's kind of a halo effect
so to speak so getting subscribers takes
a lot more than just posting videos and
today we're going to talk about some
tips to help you increase those
subscriptions and so let's start out
with some of those tips we're going to
start with creating engagement and
informative content so engaging and
informative content that's where we're
going to start talking today about how
to increase subscriptions then we're
going to talk about publishing videos
frequently so it's simply learned you
could see the past 365 days we were
consistent in publishing videos
consistently throughout the month and
the weeks so another tip we're going to
talk about is how to optimize your
YouTube videos so there's a lot that
goes into optimization but this is a key
key tip to pay attention to because when
you comes to posting publishing videos
on YouTube you need to align certain
things like keywords and content and
made a data so optimize on our videos
we're going to talk a lot about that
then we're going to talk about
optimizing the YouTube channel so
there's some tips and tricks here you
want to do to optimize your YouTube
channel producing high quality videos
we're going to talk about that adding a
subscriber water mark to your videos
okay that's another tip we're going to
mention today engage with our audience
okay that's what we want to do we want
to engage with our audience that's a
really key tip and we're saving the best
for last promote your videos in
different platforms so all of these tips
we're going to talk about today so let's
get started and talk about create
engaging informative content so that's
the first place we want to start okay so
create engaging and informative content
so if we want to gain more subscribers
on our Channel we have to create highly
engaged and informative content why
because not our audience is not going to
pay attention and they're not going to
watch the video and then then the
engagement is not going to be high and
they're not going to share the video and
they're not going to tell their friends
or like it and so this is where it all
starts you have to be able to plan your
content and not only planning your
content but you got to create it so it's
engaging and informative so how do you
do that well let's talk about that so
the first thing is you have to know your
audience okay so when you create a video
who you creating the video for I mean
that's where it all starts so when
you're creating your content you're
creating your content for your audience
you're not creating it for the entire
world now we know on YouTube there's a
lot of cute videos about kittens and
jokes and you know people playing games
and you know everybody likes positive
things on YouTube but you know when
we're talking about a specific topic you
know we really have to hone in on a
target audience and so if you know who
your audience is then you can really
hone in on your content okay so that's
the first thing ask yourself who is your
audience and then build your content
around that specific audience don't
build it just for the Mass general
population because it's not going to be
engaging and informative so that's the
first place to start then you want to
engage that audience with relevant
content so if you know your audience and
depending on the topic you want to make
sure that whatever the topic is the
content matches the topic don't ve off
course if you vear off course you're not
going to engage your viewers your
viewers are coming to watch the video
for specific reason the reason is the
topic okay so if they're your target
audience and they want to watch the
video that's a specific topic then the
content has to align so plan your video
script so if you know who your audience
is and you know you want to engage them
with relevant content go ahead and plan
the script out so what I normally do is
you know have an outline and then once I
have the outline then I go ahead and
create my slides if I will or my topics
points I want to talk about and then I
write out those points I want to make
sure I get all my points in and that's
what you should be doing you want to
plan it ahead of time so that you get
all your relevant points across that's
what makes a video informative okay you
want to ensure to give maximum
information to your audience so the key
here is maximum information so you don't
want to overload the audience but then
again you want to cut out information so
you want to make sure that when you're
planning your script and you're writing
the outline that you're making sure you
include all your points that you want to
get across once you include those points
then go ahead and you know write your
script and make sure all the information
for those points are in the script
that's how you're going to ensure you
give maximum information but you don't
want to overdo it so if you feel like
it's too much information it probably is
too much information back off a little
use the information to create another
video so it's all about knowing your
audience so all of these points play
against one another so be clear and use
more examples in your content just like
we're doing here okay just like at the
beginning of the session I showed you an
example of Simply learn subscribers over
the past 365 days and so that's what we
want to do we want to be clear but use
examples to punctuate the content or the
point we're trying to get across so we
want to include sources from high
quality sites so if you're going to use
examples make sure they're from relevant
high quality sites and when I mean high
quality meaning does your audience know
who that source is or that site if it's
really specific and your audience may
not know then it's probably not high
quality so just keep that in mind always
play to your audience so you want to
start your video with an interesting
hook so again I get it back to this
example if you're still watching this
then the hook worked we showed you our
subscriptions we showed you how we grew
over the course of a year you could see
our growth and part of it was posting a
lot of videos with relevant and
informative content and so you see how
we did it so you're paying attention you
want to know how to do it and so part of
what we did is exactly what I'm telling
you now we know who our audience is we
out our scripts we use good examples and
we start our videos with interesting
hooks now when we do our videos we also
create original content so that goes
back to planning your script okay you
always want to you know come across as
original and informative when you do
that you're going to be engaging but if
you're leveraging somebody else's
content then the engaging part may not
resonate because it's not your content
to begin with so always always always
use original content okay so keep the
content flow organized so again that
goes back to an outline you know feel
free to change up the outline so the
flow makes sense add visuals to your
content and make it appealing always
include images to me if you can use
images in your videos and play off the
video or the images then it's just going
to flow and make it a little bit more
engaging and appealing meaning the
content so visuals help guide and Aid in
the points you're trying to make so
don't make it so text Heavy you know
accentuate it balance it with some
images use Simple language and crisp
sentences meaning don't chose jargon
don't come across and talk above your
audience you always want to talk to your
audience and talk in a language that
they're going to understand so it goes
back to0 one if you know who your
audience is you're talking to them as if
they're right in front of you and not
you're above them or they're below you
you want to talk at them so add cards
end screens and pattern interrupts to
engage your audience since so YouTube
cards are just interactive panels that
slide in and out when a video is playing
so it encourages interaction by the
viewer okay so you can add up to five
cards which include images text or
clickable links so feel free to play
around with some of these features that
YouTube has to offer to make your
content more engaging so tip two publish
videos frequently so creating and
uploading videos consistently will help
you increase your YouTube subscribers so
suppose you haven't published videos for
more than say a month or two months it's
likely that that audience not going to
subscribe to your channel so think about
YouTube videos as a popular TV program
that comes on once a week when a new
episode comes on based on the regular
schedule it's consistency and that
consistency is what helps your users
stay engaged so for example if I go back
to our YouTube channel you know what
helped us gain subscribers was was our
consistency in publishing videos you
could see we were consistent in
publishing a couple of videos a week
every couple of weeks and so this helps
users stay engaged they know when the
video is coming out they know that
simply learn is good for two three four
videos a month and the great thing about
publishing videos is that when somebody
does subscribe to your channel they're
going to get a notification or YouTube
has an option where they can get a
notification via email so I subscribe to
Simply learns Channel I subscribe to
other channels like Google analytics for
example so anytime Google analytics
publishes a video I get an email that
says Hey Google analytics YouTube
channel just publish a video and the
great thing is I'm checking my email and
I'm getting this notification in Gmail
so guess what I can watch the video
right then and there just by clicking on
the link in the email I don't even have
to go to the channel but knowing that if
you publish consistently and somebody
does get the email once a week then it's
more likely they're going to engage
especially if the content is original
engaging and informative so frequent
video publishing equals more
subscriptions so according to Social
Media examiner YouTube channels that
publish videos more than once a week are
performing much better so if you can
afford to publish more videos more than
once a week the chances of you gaining
subscribers quicker are going to be
greater so keeping a fixed frequency can
help you quickly gain more subscribers
posting videos is like almost like
blogging I always say start small if you
can do one blog post a month and then
once you get in a routine then you can
ramp up the frequency so from one blog
post you can do two a month then four
times a month then once a week or twice
a week same with the YouTube videos you
want to get into a rhythm you know start
with once a month and ramp it up okay
you'll find that the more you ramp it up
the more subscribers you're going to get
so tip three optimize your YouTube
videos so optimizing your videos will
help your content rank higher on YouTube
so this is a give must it's not a give
and it's a must you must optimize your
videos if you want people to see them of
course if you don't optimize people
aren't going to see them then people
aren't going to engage and and then not
subscribe so it's just kind of a
snowball effect so this is an important
tip so I mentioned it at the beginning
when we were going over all the items
we're going to discuss this is the one
item
that is a must and a given to some
degree because if you don't optimize
your videos they're just not going to be
found so you need that audience to watch
your video so audiences who tend to
interact more with your content have
more chance to subscribe to your channel
but they're not going to subscribe if
they don't even watch your video so
there is a snowball effect in play here
if we don't optimize your videos so okay
Rob what are some of the tips to
optimize your YouTube video well let's
go through some of those tips so to
ensure your videos reaches the relevant
audience on YouTube you need to optimize
the title description in the video tag
okay Rob what do you mean by title
description and video tag so let's take
a look at that so when you actually
create your YouTube video you're going
to have an opportunity to put in a title
you're going to have an opportunity to
put in a description and you're going to
have an opportunity to add text so those
are the three key areas okay so once you
put in that what it looks like on the
front end is this so if I go back to
YouTube and here you can see another
video that we did about a month ago you
could see what is SEO so if that's our
topic that's our title uh or of the
content of the video then the title of
the video is going to be what is SEO and
you can see we also added in some other
content for the title so what is SEO and
how does it work SEO tutorial for
beginners and then our brand name so we
have some content to work with for the
title okay and then the descript we have
a lot of characters to work with
description so use as much as you can
here to describe what the video is about
here you can see we did that and so it's
always good to include this information
okay and then you can see we have tags
up here seo seo tutorial for beginners
digital marketing so we put in the
necessary information here on this video
to help us rank because if we don't
optimize it we're not going to rank and
so you can see we just put a lot of
relevant content around the description
around the title and around those tags
by doing so we're able to optimize this
video and get found so that's just an
example three of the things you can do
to help optimize your YouTube video so
if you want to watch more on how to
optimize metatags then I suggest maybe
watching the other video we did on the
subject how to rank YouTube videos so
this goes into more detail about how to
optimize the title The Meta description
and The Meta tags but those are three
quick fields or areas that you can use
to optimize your video so just something
to keep in mind write a long description
with keywords timestamps and links so
what I mean by timestamps with timestamp
an audience can choose the section of
the video that they want to look for and
then links prefer to include relevant
Links of your other videos so those are
just some additional tips to help keep
your content engaging so remember when
your content is engaging then people are
going to like it people going to share
it and watch it later so upload a
captivating thumbnail okay so you want
to include a thumbnail that's going to
grab people's attention you want to
upload a transcript of the video so that
goes back to when you're creating your
content when you write your original
content you want to keep a transcript of
the content of the video so that you can
upload that as well and then add a start
screen and end screen to your YouTube
videos so that way you know when
somebody plays the video they're going
to see it what it looks like up front
and then the way you finish it they're
going to see an end screen at the end
and so you just don't want to keep it
dark and black and non-descriptive so
according to back Linko using an exact
keyword in your video title can help you
with rankings so high ranking more views
more views more subscribers so that's
what I've been saying all along you need
to get these videos optimized so again
use an exact keyword in your video title
so let's go back again to that video I
just showed you a couple minutes ago
what is SEO so here here we started out
with a question what is SEO that's the
name of the title that's what our exact
title of the video that's our exact
keyword okay so what is SEO and how does
it work and then SEO tutorial for
beginners so what is SEO is our exact
keyword and that's part of the video
that's the content of the video that's
in the title and we use it throughout
the description as well so using that
exact keyword in your video title can
help with the ranking so whatever your
topic is your title of the video or the
topic of the video included in the title
so back Linko also mentions that there
is a moderate correlation between a
Channel's total subscribers and rankings
and so for some of you this may be
common sense it's just like organic
search if you're not ranking you're not
going to get traffic on YouTube if
you're not ranking you're not going to
get eyeballs on your videos and you're
not going to get subscribers so higher
rankings can help you to get more
subscribers but you can't get those
rankings unless you optimize and so
again just for the s sake of Simplicity
going back focus in on your title make
sure your title matches the title of the
video itself when you're publishing your
description use all the amount of
content available to you so you can see
this entire description has a lot of
content maximize the content and then
use tags using those three Fields those
three areas can help you optimize your
video and gain the necessary ranking you
need to get viewers which will turn into
subscribers so tip four optimize your
YouTube channel so we just talked about
optimizing our videos now we're going to
turn our attention to our YouTube
channel so one of the easiest ways to
ask your views to subscribe to your
channel is really by creating a good not
even a good a great YouTube channel
trailer you also want to add Channel
keywords a description and some good
artwork and then having sections and
playlists to keep your videos organized
these are all good tips to creating a
good YouTube channel so let's talk about
some of these these tips here so we want
to give your audience a preview what
your channel is offering so this is by
hooking your audience with a trailer so
you can create a a trailer to you know
just give your audience an idea of who
you are as a brand what kind of videos
you're going to be posting and give them
kind of a taste of what the future
videos are going to be like okay you can
even tell them your release schedule in
the trailer so you can start out up it's
saying hey hey guys we're new to this
we're going to be posting one video a
month but as we get rolling maybe two
per month and you know one per week you
know just being honest and open and
talking to your audience and get them
excited about future videos that's what
the trailer is all about so you also
want to keep it that the channel
description short interesting so in your
channel you want to have a description
of what the Channel's all about what
kind of videos are you going to be
posting so in addition to the trailer
you want to write something short and
interesting then we want to use keywords
in our Channel description just like in
the videos with what is SEO we included
what is SEO in the title we included you
know what is SEO in the description and
so we want to be true to what our
channel is so pick keywords not only
include those keywords in the videos but
include them in the channel description
pay attention to the first 100 to 150
characters of your channel description
because that's what's shown next your
Channel on the search results so for
example here you could see we have a
description here simply learn is one of
the world's leading certification
training providers we partner with
companies and individuals to address and
so you could see those characters 100 to
150 or what shows up in the channel
description when somebody's trying to
understand hey simply learn just upload
of this video who is simply learn so you
want to write short interesting Channel
description so that when somebody's
first introduced to your video they
could see what your Brand's all about so
and your description with an appropriate
call to action so short interesting good
call to action at the end of the video a
good call to action would be hey check

latest video something that's going to
gauge somebody and get them to watch one
of your videos so you want to pick
interesting Channel Arts so let's turn

your first videos and get them posted up
there and optimize them accordingly okay
so some other tips to go with that
channel art in description is a profile
picture relevant to your brand so you
always want to maybe put put the the
company logo up there okay so here you
can see we have the company logo add
accurate relevant Channel keywords so if
we go back to who we are who are we
we're the world's leading certification
training provider okay that's who we are
okay we partner with companies and
individuals so we're all about training
and training is one of our key wordss so
you could see at simply learn we provide
online training and machine learning AWS
Amazon web services devops big data
digital marketing project management a
lot of different topics so make sure
that's included in the channel
description feature the playlist on your
homepage so if we go back to the
homepage we can see here we have our
channels so you could see we have ai
machine learning trending Technologies
cloud computing tutorials Dev op
tutorials popular videos big data we
have a lot of different channels so you
want to organize your videos into
different playlist so those playlists
are going to feature on the homepage of
your channel so how you organize the
playlist is totally up to you but I
would certainly create a playlist for
different sections so depending on your
product your services think about how
you want to organize don't just stick
all your videos in one playlist then
optimize the playlist titles and
descriptions for search rankings so just
like the videos themselves just like the
channel description you have an
opportunity to optimize the playlist
titles and descriptions so be very keen
on aligning the right keyword with the
playlist title so here you can see
programming language tutorials project
management tutorials digital marketing
tutorials so we're very clear on how we
go about choosing our titles cuz we want
to optimize those playlist titles okay
we can rearrange our videos in a
playlist so we want to rearrange the
videos in a way that we're maybe putting
the freshest the most new the video
that's been published last first so
almost in descending order if you will
so we want our users to see what video
has the latest in that particular
playlist so they're seeing the most
recent first but you can rearrange your
videos any way you want feel free to
play around with it and of course you
can also take the video that's the most
popular and put that up front so people
could see that first vice versa you
could take a video that maybe hasn't
gotten a lot of views or isn't ranked
particular High maybe put that video up
so it can get some views and some shares
and likes so how you rearrange your
videos is totally up to you just has
some rationale behind that so choose a
playlist thumbnail from a top performing
video so for example if I go back to our
YouTube page you can see the top
performing videos here you know for
example this one we got a nice thumbnail
here what is machine learning so if I
click on that that's one most popular
videos so 3,000 likes on this video a
lot of views 250,000 plus views so have
a thumbnail to go along with that
particular video so according to
backlinko YouTube SEO ranking Factor
study discovered that channel keywords
have a small yet significant correlation
with Higher YouTube search rankings so
Channel keywords so when you're
optimizing your channel and you want to
include keywords start with your
description so if I go back to our
Channel okay if I go back about us make
sure your description has those relevant
keywords in it that's where it all
starts so in case you have any doubts if

the trailer video drop us a comment
we're more than happy to expand upon the
explanation of how to best optimize your
channel okay tip number five produce
high quality videos so we need to get in
the habit of producing high quality
videos because viewers don't prefer to
watch videos that have poor audio and
video quality it's just that simple you
need to know what it takes to produce
high quality videos if you don't you're
just going to discredit you're not going
to come across as relevant you're not
going to come across as qualified
professional there's a lot of things
attached to poor quality videos so we
need to create high quality videos for
the end user so let's talk about some
ways in which you can create high
quality videos and so the first is to
avoid any noise in the background so you
want to have a nice quiet atmosphere no
distractions so people can hear you
clearly and only you clearly you want to
use good audio recording equipment
there's plenty of options available on
the internet usually I would recommend
going with something paid not overly
expensive because you get what you pay
for so if you use something free it
might not be of good quality and you
might not have all the features and
bells and whistles with a free option so
you know use good audio recording
equipment again it could be online or it
could be some software just make sure
that you're able to produce good high
quality video and audio so when you do
purchase that audio recording equipment
you want to have something similar to an
input volume meter that way you can see
whether your audio is coming across or
not so if you're not seeing green lights
then your audio is not coming across if
it's red it might be distorted and so
you want something that's going to
signify that you're really pushing out
good quality audio you want to create
your videos in 1080 pixel size so okay
that's HD and so you want to have at
least minimum 1080 so anything less than
that it's probably going to come across
as not so good maybe staticky blurry not
professional not highdef so you want to
create a highdef video and 1080 is about
the minimum you want to go and then you
want to plan your video script before
filming so goes back to some of the
other points I made earlier you always
want to have a video script available so
you know what you're saying when you're
recording your audio that way you're not
doing something on the Fly then you want
to use good lighting for video recording
so you don't want to be in a dark place
you want some nice lighting so your
video comes across well lit people could
see you they're not struggling to strain
their eyes on what it is you're trying
to show and appear because of poor
lighting again it just comes across as
professional so if you can you know
shoot a highdef video with good audio
speaking clearly having a professional
script with some good lighting then
people take you serious and they're
going to start to listen and engage and
and see the video as good quality and
very relevant and informative and share
it so use slow motion and jump Cuts
wisely so there's some features you
could do with your video you using slow
motion and jump cuts are some of the
features you can use to accentuate your
points then set up a green background
for recording again this is for you know
making sure that the video part of it
comes across and good quality then
stabilize your video recordings with a
tripod that way you're not moving your
video camera all around and and again
it's coming across the shaky and poor
quality shoot horizontal videos you
don't want to go vertical it tends to
cut the screen so you want to stay
horizontal so that people can see
everything that should be included in
the video okay you want to capture a
wider shot using a clip on lens again a
good feature good tip to use use that
wider shot okay so you can do that using
a clip on lens and then choose good
video editing software I can't State
this enough because you're putting all
this time and effort into a video you
need to be able to edit it to cut out
you know some of the things you didn't
want to say or maybe some poor quality
or or you know you just want to have a
smooth professional output for your
video and so you got to have good video
editing software there's plenty of
options available on the internet again
I would go with something low cost but
paid usually free isn't exactly the way
you want to go if you're trying to
create a high def good quality video and
at the very least review your work
before publishing I just said it a
minute ago I'll say it again you want to
be able to have a really professional
video and high def when you have a good
professional video and high def with
good audio horizontal shots you know
nice green background image nice well
lit it's going to come across as
professional and if you have a
professional video then people are going
to going to take you seriously they're
going to see you as a professional and
then share or subscribe and like and
then they're going to watch more videos
and and that's how you start to build up
a reputation as being a very
professional organization so just
following these simple tips on producing
high quality videos so you want to
review your work because if you don't
you put all that effort into it and then
you're going to realize hey your video
is low quality and then you're going to
have to do it all over again so follow
these tips get a high quality video and
you should be on your way to ranking in
fact according to backlinko YouTube
preferably ranks HD videos so you got to
have that 1080 uh pixel size that way
you know your video is going to come
across crisp and clear and YouTube
prefers that tip six add a subscriber
Watermark to your videos so this is a
great feature in YouTube so it's a
feature that allows you to add a
watermark that could be shown on all
your videos the reason why you want that
watermark because you want to keep
reminding your audience to subscribe to
your Channel The Watermark can be
whatever you want but normally it's
going to be some type of logo or brand
and a call to action and so how do you
add a watermark to your video well you
log into your YouTube account it's it's
pretty simple at the top right corner
you're going to select your creator
Studio icon and then you're going to go
to channel select branding and then add
a watermark to your video so if we look
at that in YouTube so here Creator
Studio on the left side navigation I'm
just going to click Channel then I'm
going to click branding and then once
you click branding you have the ability
to add your watermark and then you can
add it to the entire video at the end of
the video at a specific start time and
then just click update and that's pretty
much it so you want to be able to add
this so that you can brand your videos
with an image and then add that CTA so
this is a good good feature for YouTube
it allows you to be consistent with all
your videos by branding and adding that
call to action tip seven engage with
your audience so you want to be able to
interact with your audience as much as
possible just because it's the video and
you can't see people doesn't mean you
can't engage with them so when you
interact with your viewers especially
when you interact with them immediately
there's gratification you know everybody
likes to be responding to nobody likes
to be ignored and so when somebody is
responding to there's a higher chance
that your viewers are likely to going to
become customers it's just customer
service is how you really want to look
at this okay so when you engage you're
creating a service for your customers so
here are some tips on how to engage with
your audience so first is at the end of
every video convey a thank you message
to your viewers you know thank you for
spending the time out of your busy day
to watch this video you know some of our
videos go an hour plus long and so when
somebody's taking an hour to watch a
video it's only the least you can do is
thank them now you can thank them and
give them some information about where
to go for more information H cuz if they
watch the whole video they're already
engaged and they're probably going to
want to learn more so you always want to
follow up the thank you with where to go
for more information just like our
videos always convey at the end okay you
always want to ask your audience for
their feedback or ideas on the video so
with YouTube there's a comment section
and you always want to encourage
comments so comment can be in the form
of feedback so as you're watching this
video feel free to leave feedback on
other ways to engage with your audience
or some other tips to increase your
subscribers on YouTube so we're always
looking for those ideas we want to keep
it engaging so somebody may have some
other ideas that we didn't think about
and so we always appreciate that from
our audience so we very much appreciate
the feedback that our audience gives us
so not all the feedback is always going
to be positive some of the feedback
could be less than positive or even
negative there could be mistakes so the
idea behind getting feedback is you want
to look at it you want to read it and
you want to react to it you want to
react to it positively in the form of
you know what thank you for the feedback
and looking at the feedback weighing it
and incorporating the feedback so you
don't always want to make the same
mistake twice in a video so if there's
something definitely wrong with the
video that we're doing for example and
somebody looked at it and gave us
feedback on it we'd certainly defin
definitely take a deep look into that
and try not to do the same mistake twice
because likely that user is going to
watch the video again so you always want
to learn from your mistakes okay and you
want to turn those mistakes or turn
those comments into future videos okay
so create videos based on your
commenter's request the audience is
giving us feedback we should take that
as positive and sometimes that's
creative sometimes as ideas for more
videos okay you always want to ask
questions to your audience and reward
excellent commenters so we try to ask
questions in our videos and when users
respond with the answer if there's an
excellent comment or excellent answer
you know we can reward them you know
reward them in the form of say some type
of gift card or gift certificate or
promotion or or something there's always
some way to incentivize somebody who
provides excellent feedback you can
always give Emoji Hearts there's so many
emojis out there that you can use emojis
just to engage with your audience based
on the feedback that they're giving the
point is if your audience is taking the
time to give feedback you always want to
respond to it and you want to respond to
a posit so emojis tend to have a
positive connotation to them and so
responding with an emoji especially to a
favor comment goes a long way so you can
reward your community both on and off
YouTube for their engagement and support
and that's just being creative you can
reward in many ways many ways not
necessarily monetarily but by
recognition you you could do promotions
you could do something fun there's
always ways to reward and prefer to host
live streams and interact with your
audience so you don't always have to do
a pre-recorded video there certainly
YouTube has them other platforms like
Facebook have them Instagram so you can
certainly reach out to your audience
with a live stream and that's talking
directly to your audience right there in
the flesh so when you can have an
opportunity to talk to your audience and
engage with them that's always going to
work because they can see personality
they can see what you're all about and
there's two-way conversation and so that
will lend to more of a you know
relationship so to speak with your
audience so you want to create videos
for subscribers and subscribers can get
impressed when a channel dedicates a
video for them so you know take the time
out to create a video just for your
subscribers subscribers are the ones who
are most likely going to engage with you
okay they're your loyal fan base so if
you create something for them that's a
form of a reward so you can Captivate
your viewers by uploading interesting
YouTube stories as well you can also
hear from your audience and get their
videos and use their videos and upload
them to your channel so according to
backlinko video comments have a very
strong correlation with ranking so as
you create a video feel free to talk to
your audience and ask them hey if you
have any comments feel free to put them
in the comment section right below this
video I see that a lot now with a lot of
videos and I'm going to ask my audience
right now to do the same same thing if
there's anything you see about rewarding
the audience or engaging with the
audience feel free to comment we'd love
to get your suggestions because if you
can engage with the audience even more
then that's only going to net positive
results not only in rankings but with
your subscriber base so comments are the
way to go solicit comments respond to
the comments reward the comments tip
number eight promote your videos on
different platforms so promoting your
videos on different platforms has been
around for many years it's a good
strategy once you create your video on
YouTube you want people to see it you
want to get it out there so if you want
to increase your YouTube subscribers
this is a strategy you have to perform
so let's take a look at all the ways you
can use and leverage different platforms
to increase your subscribers so before
you do that you want to research
discover how you can use different
platforms so the first thing you want to
do is look at the platforms you're
already using you're using using
Facebook and Instagram that's probably a
good place to start but there's other
platforms you can also leverage and
we're going to talk about those so
social media most companies most
individuals are on in some form or
fashion amongst the most popular like
Facebook and Instagram so you can start
there so with Facebook you can post
something include the link of your
YouTube video with Facebook if you're a
business you have a business page you're
communicating with your community and
that's a great way to get started by
promoting your YouTube video you can
also do the same on Twitter or Instagram
or whatever platform you're on go ahead
and post something or tweet something
and include that link to YouTube you can
participate in forums and blog
discussions so there's plenty of forums
and blogs out there where you can
participate in discussion and include a
link to the YouTube video if it's
relevant and natural so for example here
there's a Blog about machine learning
you can include if you have have a video
about machine learning in the response
to that conversation in this example
we've done that on Reddit you can list
your video in relevant and reputable
directories there's plenty of
directories out there there's plenty of
video directories okay that you can just
go ahead and publish your video on you
can use testimonial link building okay
so somebody can provide a testimonial
include the link of your video you can
opt for influencer marketing so if
there's somebody that is associated that
likes your brand or product and has a
large following you can ask them to post
a video on your behalf it's a great way
to reach an audience fairly quickly okay
you can earn backlinks from relative
relevant and authoritative websites so
for example if you look at this website
here test genics okay there's a article
here about you know certificate of
achievements okay for AWS so if you
scroll down we could see our video is
included here in this particular web
page so this is a high quality web page
okay that's generating a backlink for us
not only is it generating a backlink
it's also generating traffic and
awareness for the video go ahead and and
find out if there's any websites that
are relevant to your video topic and see
if you can collaborate with them on
producing a web page to include that
video you can also take advantage of
email marketing by adding your YouTube
link in the email signature for example
it's a simple email any email client
like Gmail or Yahoo or even Hotmail or
Outlook is going to have an ability to
or give you the ability to add a
signature in the signature you could
simply just include a link to the video
or to your YouTube channel it doesn't
have to be to a specific video but it's
a way to get people to your YouTube page
or to that video so the whole idea is
more eyeballs more potential subscribers
engage your Audience by posting your
video links on community pages so for
example you know we're promoting
something here on a Community page and
that's going to get some additional
traffic over to us you can always
bookmark your videos on bookmarking
sites like stumbled toon.com again this
is free very little time to do this but
it's a chance for you to get the video
out there and even generate a back blink
you can collaborate with other YouTube
channels this is always a good strategy
if you're creating a video on a
particular topic on YouTube chances are
there's probably somebody else out there
doing the same thing it doesn't have to
be necessarily a competitor it can be a
complimentary product or service and if
you offer that then go ahead and
collaborate with them and see if you can
exchange your videos on their Channel
and you could take their video and put
it on your channel in a particular
playlist okay so that's a way to
collaborate with other YouTube channels
is swap videos you could join High PR QA
sites and post answers to the questions
related to your video like core is
always a good example or EAB okay so
core there's always a question being
posted and if you have the answer to
that question in the form of your video
then go ahead and post a response with a
link to the video on YouTube it's a
great way to get the video notice and
it's relevant and natural okay you can
embed videos in your blog post so if
you're using a platform like WordPress
for example very easy to go ahead and
just take that video you can even just
put the link in the uh blog post I like
this option I think blog post are always
good because you don't have to be text
Heavy with a blog post you want to
create a blog post that's nice and
balanced with an image and text but if
you put a video to support your blog
post that goes even further and blog
post themselves can be engaging and
interactive with your audience so having
a video in your blog post always goes
well in my opinion okay so you can
promote other videos in your end screen
for example at the end of your video you
can always promote something related
like we done here in this example so
lots of ideas get your video out there
use them in email use them in your blog
post go to free bookmarking sites like
stumble upon you know collaborate with
other people on YouTube you know go to
core respond to a question use social
media to your advantage there's lots of
opportunities to get your video out
there the more you can get your video
out there the more traffic you're going
to get the more traffic you get to the
video the more subscribers you're going
to get so that's how the game is played
in order to get your video out there but
these are relatively you know low time
consuming ideas to get your video we're
going to talk about how to get traffic
to your website so thank you for joining
and let's get started so let's imagine
you're setting up your own website okay
you're clicking away You're developing
using some good tools you're developing
you're designing you're doing some QA
you're testing you're sharing with
Friends and Alpha version and then
finally your website is all set up
congratulations well when you hit enter
and your website is finally published
what's going to happen well few days
later you're checking your website and
you're looking at analytics and you
notice your traffic's very low okay well
you're scratching your head because
you've done all this work with your
website but you're not getting any
traffic so the reason is you
spend all your time developing designing
the website to make it look good but you
didn't do anything or any planning or
any strategy around bringing users to
your website so the two go hand inand
you just can't build a website without
thinking about how to drive users to the
website and so before I tell you how to
bring traffic to your website let me
tell you why this is so important okay
why do we want to bring users to our
website I mean it has to be on equal
ground as web development and design is
somebody who goes to your site and then
does something when they get to your
site so you have users and when those
users get to your site they're
generating page views and traffic and
you want to turn that traffic into
engagement okay so each Page's traffic
is configured independently of all their
pages so when you go when somebody goes
to your website they look at a page
that's a page view and certain pages on
your website you want to turn that page
view into a conversion okay whether that
be you know looking at a video or
purchasing something so think of these
pages on your website as salespeople
they're trying to convert visitors who
come to your website but first we need
to get the visitors to your website so
when you get visitors to your website
again you can generate sales which means
revenue or you can increase brand
awareness or you can earn Revenue
through sponsored post and advertisement
so if you have have for example a lot of
content on your website you can turn
that into to revenue by hosting ads on
your website so when somebody clicks on
that ad you're going to earn a
percentage of that click okay what that
click is worth so having a website means
a lot of good things for you but first
you got to get the traffic there and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
tell you how to drive traffic to your
website so there's lots of different
ways in which you can bring traffic to
your website well the first is paid
advertising so paying to advertise your
products services with ads is one of the
easiest ways to drive traffic to your
website so some of the options available
are search ads social media ads or
display ads so search ads are ads that
are displayed in the search engine
results so when a user types in a
keyword query you want your ad to show
up based on that keyword query okay so
an example is digal marketing course
somebody types in digital marketing
course and simply learn is the first ad
that shows up how do we know it's an ad
because you could see the word add next
to the domain so when somebody clicks on
that link simply learn is going to pay
Google so that's how search advertising
works okay the next is social so social
media marketing involves increasing
traffic or engagement or brand awareness
lots of different strategies but you're
instead of doing this on search you're
doing it on a social media platform okay
so for example you can advertise on any
particular platform and the way you
advertise could be with an image it
could be with a video so in this case
you could see Cobo is doing a sponsored
ad here how to succeed with Google ads
and then another form of advertising is
display so display means creating ads
that are placed on specific websites so
with display
unlike search you have a choice in the
ad format with search you only have text
ads but with display you have text ads
image ads rich media ads video ads so
you have lots of different options in
which you can advertise on other
websites so the idea here is to get your
ad in front of the Right audience when
they could see your display Banner your
banner ad then it's going to be more
visual more appealing generate some
brand interest and hopefully you can get
somebody to click on that ad and over to
your website so that's paid advertising
again through search through social
through display but you can also promote
your site on social media so once your
content is gone live you can take
advantage of different social media
platforms I mean it really depends on
what you're trying to promote because
what you're trying to promote needs to
align with the appropriate social media
platform so Facebook is best suited for
Industries like food and Beverages and
news and media and if you're selling a
product so you fall under one of those
categories and Facebook could be the
right platform for you if you're
involved in again beauty or food and
beverage or e-commerce then you can also
leverage Instagram which is part of
Facebook's ecosystem so if you advertise
on Facebook you can also advertise on
Instagram Andor Instagram so it doesn't
have to be and Facebook and Instagram it
could be Facebook or Instagram you have
LinkedIn as a platform LinkedIn is great
for B2B so if you're trying to promote
industry news or or tips and best
practices or job postings then LinkedIn
is the place for you it's a B2B platform
it's great for targeting specific
Industries targeting specific job levels
or job descriptions okay so LinkedIn is
great if you're into B2B focusing on the
business side of it so you also have
YouTube now now YouTube is part of
Google's ecosystem YouTube is a video
platform okay so it's great if you're
trying to promote gaming or
entertainment if you're a vlogger okay
so YouTube's a great way to promote your
site uh by getting your product out
there in the form of a video then you
have Twitter Twitter to me encompasses a
lot of different Industries Beauty and
fitness news and media entertainment
okay you have limited number of
characters but but a lot of people are
active on Twitter and it's a great way
to generate some awareness and get some
clicks over to your website so these are
just some of the most popular social
media platforms of course there are
plenty more out there the third way in
which you can drive traffic to your site
is guest post blogging so most of you
already know what blogging is all about
well if you're blogging for your own
site you can jump on somebody else's
site and blog on their behalf so having
the opportunity to guess post on another
website can be very helpful because one
that other blog could have lots of
traffic and have a a well-known brand so
if you're blogging on another blog it's
going to build your brand awareness and
potentially increase traffic to your
blog or website so it exposes to you to
targeted traffic so if you're going to
guest blog guest blog on a site that's
very relevant to your business or
industry that way you're targeting the r
audience okay you can expand your
personal Network so getting yourself out
there getting your brand out there in
front of a different audience and then
obviously for serves because it
generates a backlink so Surs search
engine ranking Pages means that hey if
you want to rank organically you're
going to have to generate some backlinks
so guest blogging is an a way to
generate some backlinks to your site and
an effect that's going to help you get
your pages ranked higher because
Google's going to recognize the
relationship from one blog to your blog
and build up your relevancy so some
other benefits here to guest blogging is
you can grow your social media PL
following because you can then promote
that on social media that you're guest
blogging okay again you can improve your
online Authority okay because when
you're guest blogging and you have
recognition on that guest blog if it's a
popular blog then it's going to help
your domain and Page Authority for SEO
and then the end result is going to
improve your back Ling score so there a
lot of benefits to guest blogging to me
at the end of the day it's just about
reaching out to your audience using
another platform to do that in the form
of a Blog and the results of that is
going to mean more brand awareness for
you and turning that traffic from that
other blog into qualified leads so you
can also interview industry thought
leaders so that's another way an
interesting way to generate traffic to
your sites so reaching out to thought
leaders for interviews okay could
generate some credibility for you and
the other person so it's reciprocal so
it means that you're active in the
industry that you're in and it allows
you to engage with other leaders in the
industry and the indirect net result of
that could be increase traffic because
if you do the interview and you record
it or if it's via video then you can
obviously post it on other platforms and
that could in turn Drive traffic to your
website obviously just like guest
blogging it's going to to increase your
reach so getting yourself out there if
nobody knows who your brand is and they
know who the thought leaders are and
they see you interviewing the thought
leaders then that's going to put you in
front of these people and so it's going
to increase your reach another way to
drive traffic to your website is just to
make sure your website's responsive and
what do we mean by responsive well we
mean does it work on multiple devices
specifically mobile so depending on the
device your website has shows shrinks
enlarges or moves content so that it
conforms to the browser that that
person's looking at on your for your
website so if somebody's looking on
mobile at your website you want to make
sure that your website adjust
accordingly so you want to be able to
you know test and make sure it's
responsive and so is content arranged
based on importance okay does it work
across different browsers on different
devices and do the images textt and
everything else align just like it does
on desktop so there are plenty of tools
out there on the web all you need to do
is just do a search for you know check
my website for responsiveness you know
so you you can use plenty of tools to
check to see if your website is
responsive towards multiple devices why
is that important because if somebody
goes to your website Via Mobile and your
site doesn't aligned properly or the
content's all stretched out and somebody
has to maneuver their brow browser just
to see your website then chances are
they're not going to come back chances
are they're not even going to convert
okay so you want to be able to revise
your device browser combinations you
want to make sure that everything works
accordingly you want to be able to test
those fonts make sure they look good and
then you also want to make sure that
people can navigate so if they're on
mobile are they going to navigate just
as easy as they can on desktop and if
you have any popups you want to probably
make sure they're removed so that way
when somebody's looking at your website
they're not getting interfered with on
mobile and then of course you want to
make sure that these Pages load okay so
they load just as quick on desktop as
they should on mobile and vice versa so
they should not take a long time to load
so moving on from responsiveness on
mobile to building a brand community so
brand community refers to a group of
people who identify your brand and user
brand is a platform to exchange ideas
and contribute content some advantages
of having a brand Community are
promoting brand evangelism and loyalty
it could be a source of feedback loyalty
and ideas so build a community build a
brand Community who you know identify
with you okay so continue to you know
treat these people as loyal customers
okay maybe give them a promotion uh to
use specifically just for them that they
they can use on your website or talk
directly to them because you know that
they're followers they're repeat
customers they purchase for you multiple
times so talk to them differently as
well you know who these people are and
that's what building a Brand's all about
it's about identifying your brand with
other people okay and identify people
who identify with your brand and
messaging and talking to them as if
they're part of your own Community your
own family so you can use user generated
content that provides future marketing
strategies so the feedback you get from
your own Community could be in turn used
to promote or used in future marketing
strategies I.E advertising I.E post on
social okay can also provide PR
opportunities so it's a chance for you
to you know put out press releases based
on the community that you build so any
brand regardless of who it is should be
able to identify With Their audience
their target audience and that target
audience eventually going to become part
of a community these are group of people
who identify with you what you're trying
to sell what your cause is what your
mission statement is what your service
is they identify with you so leverage
them and reciprocate identify them talk
to them separately give them the what
they deserve the respect and loyalty
that they deserve as well because
they're communicating and they're
following you as a brand so the next
thing you could do to drive traffic is
Be Active in the comments section so
engage in relevant and thought-provoking
conversations on other blogs and sites
it doesn't necessarily have to be
another blog per se it could be other
sites like Reddit or core or medium
sites that have a lot of content that
are broken out by industry that allow
you to engage in conversation allow you
to either up vote share or respond okay
so be active because when you're active
people are going to see that hey you're
a leader in the industry you know what
you're talking about you have some some
brand Equity you have some thought and
some knowledge on the specific topic and
subject so it just puts you in a better
light when you can respond and be active
on these different platforms okay let's
turn our attention to search engine
optimization also known as o or organic
search so in order to drive traffic to
your site you're going to have to
implement an SEO strategy why do you
want to implement an SEO strategy
because it can help you improve your
overall searchability and visibility on
search engines and obviously that comes
with advantages one of those advantages
is obviously more traffic to the site
search is still King in terms of volumes
of people using search on a daily basis
so you have a a great opportunity to be
found it also builds trust and
credibility because still a majority of
the people who do a search click on an
organic search listing and so if you're
found organically and you're ranked
number one then chances are somebody's
going to click on your listing and it
provides increased engagement in traffic
and so what that means is more traffic
more engagement and engagement is
something you define it could be again a
download of a document or the clicking
on the play button of a video or or
submitting a form or signing up for a
newsletter or calling these are all
forms of Engagement so the amount of
traffic you drive from organic search to
your website is only going to improve
engagement okay so you can also provide
an improveed user experience and what do
we mean by that well if you're getting
lots of traffic from organic search you
have a really good opportunity to do a
testing and when you do AB testing you
can improve user experience meaning
you're showing one variation against the
other from people coming from organic
search and so this is helpful in that
you know if you're running an AB test
the variation has a chance to improve or
outperform the original and if it
outperforms the original you're
improving user experience and then it
helps Target quality traffic so SEO to
me or all search is the only medium in
which you're meeting somebody halfway
you're you're addressing what they're
looking for so if somebody's looking for
a pair of red women's Nike shoes the
2019 model and you have that particular
product to offer well you have a chance
of showing up via organic search
somebody types in you women's red Nike
shoes size whatever at the year 2019
model then of course they're going to
probably like
click on your listing because you have
what they're looking for and and that
goes with any keyword any industry any
business any segment any type of product
you're selling so again you have a
chance to really be visible for what
people are looking for and so that's the
beauty of search engine optimization you
have a really good opportunity here to
meet people halfway to drive quality
traffic to get them to enjoy a good user
experience all the while gener creting
engagement and along with SEO we want to
be able to build backlink so SEO is a
two-pronged approach meaning you have
two strategies in one on page and off
page and so off page involves
backlinking so backlinks are just links
that direct users from other websites to
your own website so with that inherently
it's going to drive traffic qualify
traffic to your website because if
somebody's on a relevant website that's
linking to yours and they click on that
link and go to your website it's likely
going to be qualified meaning they're
going to be relevant and so backlinking
because it's an off-page strategy why is
it an off-page SCS strategy because if
Google crawls that other site that has a
link to you then that's going to give
you credit because Google say hey this
site's getting some links from some
relevant sites we must think they're
relevant and there we're going to trust
this site so by Google trusting your
site it's going to improve your organic
ranking and with the organic rankings
being improved meaning it's going to
mean faster indexing so what does that
mean so you want to be indexed by the
search engines and so the quicker Google
can find your pages even if it's on
somebody else's site then that means
they're going to follow that link go to
that page on your site and take that
page back to their servers to be indexed
okay so the quicker you can get indexed
the quicker you can get found and then
it helps with referral traffic so so
again we noticed that our efforts are on
SEO organic search but if you're getting
traffic from another website hey that
still counts that's referral traffic
okay so that's a side advantage to
having backlinks is good traffic from
other sites okay so those those are
inherently the some of the reasons to do
backlinking okay never hurts I mean
there's brand awareness reasons to being
on other sites as well there's industry
leadership meaning if you you you post
content on Reddit okay you're coming
across as an industry leader but yet
generating a backlink which helps with
SEO and referral traffic so there's a
lot of benefits to building backlinks
and the opposite of backlinks are
internal links so you want to do
internal linking and that just means
connecting one page on your site to
another and why is that beneficial
because it can help direct visitors to
other Pages they wouldn't normally
otherwise find via your navigation so if
you're active on a Blog don't be afraid
to include multiple internal links you
want to move people through your site
you want the flow of traffic to go from
one page to another to another and so
when you do internal linking just like
with backlinks it's going to improve the
indexing of your website Google's going
to follow those links and index those
pages and Google does give credits from
an SEO perspective from an internal
linking perspective so if one page is
linked to another and that page has
really good relevance in the eyes of
Google then the other page is probably
going to benefit from that the other
reason you want to do internal linking
again you want to move people from your
one page of your site to the other and
when you do that it's going to reduce
bounce rates so bounce rate is simply
the rate of which people land on a page
and then leave so if I have 100 people
land on my homepage and only one person
went to another page and the other 99
left the site then that's a 99% bounce
rate so so by putting internal links in
place you're helping people move from
one page to the other and thus reducing
the balce rate and that's what you want
you want to keep people on your site you
want to be greedy it also drives traffic
to older post so again when we say older
post we're really referring to blog post
so if you have a relevant blog post and
you're writing a new blog post then link
the two together if it's relevant link
it I don't you know regardless of how
old it is you know you want to show
Google that these older blog posts just
because they were written a year ago
doesn't mean they're outdated and
oldfashioned okay or useless you want to
keep them alive by linking to them so to
me that's a good strategy for internal
linking link to older blog post you know
show people you're an industry expert
you've been doing this for a while and
you have lots of content to share okay
so the longer you can keep somebody on
your website the more likely it is
they're going to engage and convert and
some other inherent benefits improve
page rank so what we mean by Page rank
is simply just a rank that Google gives
pages so the more internal linking you
have the better off you are and then it
helps spread link juice across websites
and what mean by link juice again just
like backlinking it builds relevancy so
just keep all these inherent benefits in
mind to internal linking the end result
is keeping the flow of traffic on your
site and all these other benefits will
fall into place okay so another way in
which you can really hone in on traffic
to your website is longtail keywords and
longtail keywords to me are more than
just one or two keyword phrases okay so
there're usually three or longer
keywords in a phrase okay so longtail
keywords really nowadays account for
most web searches people really take the
time to even post questions as a search
query say likely somebody it's unlikely
somebody's going to go into search and
just type in the word shoes they might
type in red shoes but that's unlikely
what they're probably going to type in
is you know red Nike running shoes
2019 or some variation of that okay
that's a longtail keyword and some of
the advantages of using longtail
keywords to be found for are less
competition so if you're using broad
keywords like red shoes then who doesn't
want to be found for Red Shoes well you
don't necessarily you don't want to be
found for red shoes cuz it's too broad
you don't know what type of shoes
somebody's looking for you just know
they're looking for Red Shoes it could
be running shoes it could be work shoes
it could be you know boots it could be
slippers okay it's too broad so longtail
keywords help narrow it in and the more
narrow and focused a keyword is the less
competition is going to have and when
something's not competitive in the form
of a keyword then that means your
chances of ranking for that keyword are
going to be greater and the chances of
you ranking faster are going to be
greater and and then of course if
somebody's looking for exactly what you
have to offer then you have a higher
chance to convert that person so if you
have exactly those
2,9 red Nike women's running shoes and
somebody does a search for that and
that's a longtail key word and they
click on your organic listing you have
the right price then they're probably
going to convert so you have a really
good chance of converting somebody using
longtail keywords so my point here is if
you're looking for key words to use
focus on longer tail don't focus on one
or two keyword phrases what it also does
is brings targeted traffic so even if
somebody doesn't convert hey they could
be back because it's exactly what
they're looking for and if you're
focusing on longer tail keywords like I
just mentioned stay away from the
shorter ones it's just easier to
optimize your page for SEO so remember
SEO is a two-pronged approach on page
and off page we talked about off-page
with internal linking and backlinks on
page is all about making sure keywords
you choose are integrated in with the
page you want to be found for and so if
you're using a longtail keyword it's
just easy to work that keyword in so it
enables easier onpage optimization okay
let's switch away from SEO to email
marketing so let's focus on email
marketing as a form or method of driving
traffic to your website so email
marketing has been around a long time in
terms of digital marketing why because
it provides an effect effective way to
convert leads into sales why because you
can send personalized emails to a target
audience so when you send an email to
somebody on a regular basis you know who
that person is so what are you doing in
the email you're writing a specific
message to that person well email
marketing is the same thing except
you're just sending an email to a larger
group of people and when you send an
email to a larger group of people you're
still going to personalize the message
right you're not to send a generic email
to 1,000 people okay nobody's going to
do that so make sure your email is
targeted and if it's targeted it could
be cost effective why because sending
large amounts of emails or let's just
say an email to a large amount of people
or a large group of people is going to
be cost effective it's not cost per
click you know it's not cost per open
okay so email usually depending on the
the email provider you're using really
is a flat fee so it just really depends
on how many emails you're sending or how
how many people you're sending the email
to as well so but email generally tends
to be more cost effective than other
forms of marketing so look at the email
content provider you're using and just
get a sense of what they charge but if
you look at it and do a comparison email
generally is cheaper than say doing
payperclick because with paper click
you're paying for each click okay so
that could be expensive depending on the
keywords so email marke is also time
saving okay meaning it's a one-time
thing and done so once you send the
email it's just a matter of you know
watching and looking at the metrics and
learning what's going on so you don't
make the same mistakes again but it is
time conducive meaning you send out one
email and that's it with payperclick
you're constantly measuring and managing
the campaigns and it provides real-time
marketing so when you do send the email
more than likely majority of the people
on day one or the day you send the email
are going to be able to view it open it
click on some of the links and convert
so that's normally what happens in email
majority of the people open it on day
one and it kind of tails off from there
so think about it as real time so when
you send that email and if you have a
th000 people on your email recipient
list break it up send the first 500
first with a different subject line and
then you can see the data come in and if
you don't see the good results from the
subject line or the body of the email or
you know the page you're going to then
make adjustments before you send the
other email to the next 500 so that's a
great thing about emails you can break
up the email into two groups the first
group and then the second group with
different subject lines and you can
probably send them a little bit of time
apart that way you can learn from the
first email because with email you are
generally going to get results right
away okay within the first 24 hours so
that's a great thing about email
okay so the other thing about email it's
less intrusive so normally people who
are going to get the email are the ones
who sign up for the email so they're
almost expecting your email so when they
get your email again as long as you're
not sending an email on a daily basis
normally most companies send it monthly
or bi-weekly it's not going to be as
intrusive okay and then it also helps
build credibility increase visibility
and brand awareness meaning you're going
to build your brand in that email you're
going to put content in that email
that's going to show off your
credibility meaning you could put some
testimonials in the email you can put
some good affiliations you can put a
good article to an industry article you
just wrote so email is going to
inherently continue to build brand
awareness for you okay and it's an easy
way to track Roi so if you're e
e-commerce it's pretty clear you send
the email somebody opens it clicks on it
checks out and purchases something it's
easy easily trackable because you could
track it right from that email so one
thing I want to say there is just if you
do send an email make sure you're
tracking that campaign and you want to
be able to use an analytics program like
Google analytics if you use Google
analytics you're going to be able to
track when you send the email who clicks
on it and who converts so you want to be
able to measure an Roi for these emails
and you can and that's the beauty of
email marketing okay let's move away
from email marketing to webinars so
webinars
great method for Effective social media
promotion it's a great way to bring
traffic to your website so why do we
recommend webinars well because it
provides direct content contact within
your target group what do we mean by
contact with your target group well
you're going to host a webinar and
you're going to invite this targeted
group of people who are interested in
your product or service so if you have a
Facebook Community you can do a Facebook
live event or you could do a YouTube or
you know you can even set up a webinar
on another platform but promote it on
social media and if you're promoting
something on social media you're
probably promoting it to people who are
already following you or like you and so
that's what we mean by direct contct
with your target groups you're you're
going to be able to create a webinar and
talk directly to that group and that's
going to help build brand awareness and
credibility and the great thing about
webinars is you don't need some fancy
software I mean I'm talking to on a
webinar right now and so webinars are
free all you need is a video camera and
a recorder that's all and that's all
built in with software so there's plenty
of software out there that allows you
just to do a webinar really quick and
easy there's lots of opportunities in
software so and a lot of them are very
coste effective so if you want to build
uh create a webinar you can do that by
spending very little money and webinars
again allow you to talk to your your
targeted group your community maybe
prospective clients it helps build
credibility and in effect Drive traffic
to your website and when somebody does
attend a webinar they're likely going to
be highly engaged because you're
inviting them they're going to opt into
the webinar and the great thing about
webinars is even if they don't attend
the webinar the day you have it it's
going to be recorded so they can always
go back and watch it so whoever watches
the webinar is going to be engaged
because it's going to be a topic they
interest interested in and then users
are likely to become prospective
customers so having a webinar talking
about something inherently interesting
to maybe a larger group of people you
can promote that on social media and
potentially get prospective customers to
sign up and watch the webinar and if you
do they're going to be engaged and then
take the next step oh I like what this
guy this person has to say they seem to
be credible I like their personality I
like their brand I like their product
I'm going to go check their web out
their website okay so webinars allow you
to kind of pull in more people as well
as just your community because you can
promote the webinar and you can promote
it in advance and you can leverage
social media for that okay so something
related to webinars incorporating video
content so videos have been proven to be
a really good way to attract new
visitors and it just it makes your
website very engaging when you have
videos on your website as well so if you
create video you have an opportunity to
post it on various video platforms like
YouTube or VMO okay there's plenty of
video platforms out there or just
embedded in a blog post or embedded in a
Facebook post or a tweet okay so you can
do a lot with video and having video on
your site is going to increase
engagement okay when you increase
engagement good things happen that's
going to lead to increased conversion
and sales or or Roi or just like we
mentioned the webinar can help build
trust with your audience so even that
webinar you could post on your website
so you want people to engage by watching
this video they watch the video they're
going to gain trust in you because
you're talking directly to that person
that user that audience that visitor to
your website and when you get buil trust
it's going to increase engagement and
that's the beauty of video unlike text
or imagery video really do engage with
the audience and so the more video you
can do the better off you are because
again you can leverage social to draw
attention to your brand and product and
service and then you can have that video
on your website to increase engagement
which in turn increases conversions and
sales and improves Roi so always think
video there's plenty of video software
out there that you can leverage and the
great thing about video 2 is hey most
people are using mobile phones these
days smart smartphones and so video
works just as well on mobile as it does
on desktop so keep that in mind you know
video is going to be engaging regardless
of what device somebody uses and then of
course if they're watching the video on
Facebook or YouTube then it chances are
they're going to share that particular
video which is going to bode well for
your brand and traffic okay so video if
somebody likes a video it's very easy to
share video especially from a mobile
phone so YouTube just makes it so easy
to share or like or subscribe to a
channel it just it becomes that much
easier things can go viral and Chan of
them going viral with video are going to
be greater okay so other ways to drive
traffic to your website is submit your
content to content aggregators so what's
a Content aggregator well a Content
aggregator is like Reddit that provides
a great platform for you to post your
content so that's what a Content
aggregators really a site like Reddit or
medium or Kora where you could post
content to a large number of people okay
so with Reddit people are either going
to up vote it or down vote it so the
more upvotes you get or thumbs up or
likes or people who encourage that
content the more of a chance it has to
be found and so first thing out of the
gate if you do provide content to a
Content aggregator like Reddit make sure
it's good quality content that's
interesting and that should be a case
the case across the board whether it's a
a social post or blog post make sure the
content's unique professional and
interesting and then if you do say put
something on medium or you do put
something on Kora and it is professional
and interesting and thought-provoking
then people are going to react to it and
then that again could lead to traffic
but even if it doesn't lead to traffic
it helps build brand awareness so if you
have content just like videos leverage
it put the content out there okay when
you put content out there it's only
going to especially if it's good content
put it's going to put you in a good
light so don't be afraid to share your
content on the likes of Reddit or medium
or core or some of these other content
aggregator websites because good things
are only going to happen and again
referral traffic SEO brand awareness
conversions so all these are inherent
benefits of just sharing your content
okay and then finally we want to learn
from analytics Okay so what do I mean
learning from analytics so there are
plenty of analytics platforms out there
one of the most popular is Google
analytics so you want to make sure
you're tracking traffic on your site
with Google analytics so all you have to
do is just go to Google analytics via
search sign up add the analytics code to
your website and waa they're doing all
the heavy lifting they're going to track
traffic coming to your website and not
only they going to track traffic but
they're going to tell you how that
traffic engaged and so the benefits of
it Google analytics is hey you could
figure out where users are coming from
are they coming from that email campaign
that I sent out to a thousand people are
they coming from YouTube based on that
video I posted or are they coming from
Reddit based on the content I just
posted there or they coming from organic
search it so Google analytics can help
us understand how much traffic we're
getting from organic search so it'll
help us measure our SEO efforts and then
with Google analytics you could segment
so we could seg M by mobile we can
segment by desktop returning user new
user by campaign by Page by Language by
city by region I mean there's so many
ways in which to segment your audience
and segmenting simply is breaking up the
entire group of people who come to your
website into different segments based on
what you want to see so if you want to
look at you know females between the
ages of 18 to 24 who come from mobile
via organic search that's a segment and
you can look at that information in
analytics if that's your target audience
then you could see how they're
performing okay so an there are a lot of
benefits to Google analytics definitely
want to take advantage of segmenting in
Google analytics you could look at your
competition so there's a benchmarking
report the great thing about Google
analytics you can also look at content
and how your content's performing when
somebody lands on your website are they
what page are they spending time on what
page are they engaging on the most okay
what pages have the highest bounce rate
or the lowest time on page so you can
really determine what pages work best
and then of course the end result in
analyzing all this data is you want to
be able to find in your website so take
advantage of the data that Google
analytics or any other analytics
platform has given you by learning once
you learn what's going on with your
website you can make adjustments to your
website to improve user experience so to
kick off our Google ads campaign we'll
start by creating a new campaign so once
you're logged into your Google ads
account Begin by clicking the blue plus
new campaign button so here you're
presented with a list of campaign
objectives now choosing the right
objective is crucial because it guides
Google ads on how to optimize your
campaign so let's see one by one the
first objective is sales so this is
perfect for businesses looking to drive
Direct convers
whether it's online purchases phone
orders or inperson sales so for instance
if you run an e-commerce tore this
objective will help you target users who
are ready to buy so Google will
prioritize showing your ads to people
most likely to complete a transaction
based on their behavior and intent so
this makes it ideal for businesses
focused on generating immediate Revenue
so you can use this when your primary
goal is to turn clicks into sales making
it perfect for businesses with clear
purchase Parts like online stores or
service providers now next we have the
leads objective so this is designed for
businesses that want to gather contact
information from potential customers
such as through form submissions phone
calls or signups so for example imagine
you are a real estate agent aiming to
build a list of potential home buyers so
by selecting the leads objective Google
ads will optimize your campaign to reach
users likely to fill out your contact
form or call your office now next is
website traffic now this is the
objective you'll want to choose if a
main goal is to drive more visitors to
your website so this is particularly
useful for increasing brand awareness or
getting people to explore your products
and services online like for instance if
you're a blogger or a content creator so
this objective will help you attract
visitors to your site to engage with
your articles videos or any other
content that you put up so now next
comes app promotions so this is when you
have created an app like for example uh
you know an online gaming app or
anything and you want more installs or
downloads now next you have awareness
and consideration so it is designed for
businesses that want to engage users and
encage them to think about their
products or services so this is
especially effective and introducing
something new to the market and then you
have local shop visits and promotions
and then you can also create a campaign
without a goals guidance okay so here we
are planning to give an example for lead
generation like how to generate lead for
an a free online course provider so
let's select leads and continue now as
we have selected an objective it is
generating leads the next step is to
choose your campaign type so there are
several campaign types like Google ads
offers several types but the two most
common are search and display ads so
anyways let's start with the search ads
so these are the text based ads that
appear at the top of the Google search
results when someone searches for
keywords related to your business like
for example let's see let's just see car
rentals near me so your ad could appear
like this like as you can see the
sponsored ads so your ads could appear
at the top of the search results So This
is highly effective for capturing High
intern users so people who are actively
looking for what you offer now next we
have display ads so these are visually
engaging ads that appear across the
Google Display Network like which
includes websites like the ads basically
the ads you see in others websites apps
or even YouTube so now display ads are
perfect for building awareness and
keeping your brand top of mind so they
work well for retargeting like showing
you adds to people who have previously
visited your website but didn't take any
action
now the next one is shopping ads now
shopping ads are a powerful tool for
e-commerce websites so these ads
showcase your products directly in the
search results complete with images
prizes and your studio like for example
if we search leather
jackets just a
second leather jacket yeah so your
shopping ad could appear displaying a
product image price and a link to
purchase directly from your website as
you can see here so this makes it easy
for potential customers to see what
you're offering and click through to buy
so shopping as an ideal if you're
looking to drive sales of physical
products providing a visual direct part
to purchase then we have video ads which
is another impactful way to reach your
audience especially on Plat video ads
you can create engaging content that
appear before during or other videos on
YouTube so it is basically the videos
like the ad videos that you see like
while watching your YouTube video and
then we have performance Max campaign so
this type uses Google's machine learning
to optimize your ads across all Google
properties like including search display
YouTube Gmail Etc so performance Max
campaigns are perfect when you want to
maximize your results without managing
multiple campaign types separately so
Google's algorithms will automatically
find the best combination of AD formats
and placements to meet your objectives
so right now we'll select the search
campaign type and we want like we'll be
giving lead form submissions and let's
press continue and let's just keep like
lead
search so now that we have selected our
campaign type the next step is to set
your budget and bidding strategy so this
is crucial as it determines how much
you're willing to spend and how Google
ads will manage your bits so now for
bidding since our objective in this demo
to generate leads we'll choose
conversions so this strategy lets Google
automatically set your bids to get the
most conversions within your budget so
now you can set a Target cost per action
so this budget is the amount of
comfortable spending per action so like
you can just give 0.3 rupees you know
per action and let's press next now next
let's define our targeting options so
this step is about deciding who will see
your ads where they will see them and
when so you can Target users by location
as you can see all countries and
territories India or any other location
you have options so for example if your
store is in Delhi you might want to
Target only people within a 50 m radius
now Additionally you can also refine
your audience based on demographic such
as age gender and household income so
this ensures your ads reach the most
relevant relevant customers and you can
also select the languages that your you
know customers speak like you can give
English you can give uh Hindi so you can
select multiple languages that your
target audiences speak and also you can
you know select the audience segments
like what your audience may be doing
like for example we are actually you
know giving this example for lead
generation for a free online course
provider so what we do is we can
actually like our audience will be
students right so we can give students
yeah you can give current University
students and this is also for working
professionals so you can be
working education jobs it and Technical
so you can select who your target
audience are so effective targeting is
crucial for maximizing your ad spend so
take the time to consider who your ID
customers are now let's go to next so
now next is selecting keywords so for
search ads keywords are the backbone of
your campaign so these are the words or
phrases users type into Google when
looking for products or services like
yours so choose keywords that are
closely related to your business so for
example we are actually looking for lead
generation for this particular website
which is simply learn skill up website
that provides free online courses so
first you have to give the final URL and
then you have to enter your keywords you
can also you know type in the products
or services like you advertise like the
C name and everything and you can enter
the keywords now you can take the help
of Google's Keyword Planner for keyword
ideas and see how often they searched so
let's just go to Keyword Planner
discover new keywords so now here you
have to enter the products or Services
closely related to your business so here
I'll just type online
sry free online
course digital marketing so you can give
so many keywords okay and let's give
get results so now these are the
keywords that are suggested by the
Keyword Planner so what you can do is
you can just select the keywords like
you can select so many multiple keywords
you can copy it you can paste it here so
this is a demo that's why I've just
taken you know three to four keywords
but in fact you have to use more
keywords so now you have selected your
keywords now it's time to create your ad
so your ad copy includes the headline
description and display URL so this is
what users will see in the search
results or across the Display Network so
basically in your ad so making it
engaging and relevant so first you can
give the URL of your
website so in the headline you can grab
the attention by highlighting your key
offerings and including one of your main
keywords like for example you can give
Master digital marketing you can get
like you have to fill at least three
headlines so you can give free
Digital P course or you can give this
and you can even fill more headlines now
you can use the description so this is
the description part so you can use a
description to expand on your offer so
like you can highlight unique selling
points of yours like expert instructors
for example you can give expert
instructors
sorry or
flexible
learning or like enroll today to boost
your career Etc so once you have done
this
let's go to next now this shows your
budget so as you can see we had given
like
0.244 cost per conversion so your weekly
cost will be 5,00 rupees so here you can
see the budget now the final step is
before we launch is important to review
all the details now Google ads will show
you a summary of your campaign settings
including your budget targeting keywords
and add copy so you can double check so
next is the review so here you can
double check everything to ensure it
aligns with your objective so this will
take some time so so like once you're
satisfied you can publish your campaign
so your ads will start running shortly
and you can monitor their performance in
real time through dashboard today we're
going to cover search engine
optimization interview questions and
answers so thanks for joining again and
here's how it's going to work so if you
have any questions to these questions or
answers feel free to just comment right
below this video and we'll get back to a
as soon as possible we're going to go
through a series of questions and I'm
going to answer those questions for you
okay so the first question that you
might be asking an interview is
differentiate between do follows and no
follows okay so if you taken or listen
to my SEO courses on YouTube for SEO we
we talked a lot about do follows and no
follows and and simply put I mean do
follows or just signals to the search
engines to follow the link so there's a
link on site a pointing to site B we're
going to basically tell Google Bing and
some of these other search engines hey
go ahead and follow that link now a no
follow is just the opposite so no follow
link doesn't allow the search engine
crawlers to follow it so if we have a
link on our site site a pointing to site
B we can put a no follow tag in there
and what that's going to do it's going
to signal to the Crawlers hey don't
follow this link so in the end if the
Crawlers don't follow the link then
there's not going to be any link juice
passed and so Google is not going to
give you credit or give that site credit
for having a link pointing to it or
pointing to another site or from another
site and so it's all about linking so we
can control if there's links on our site
whether we want the Crawlers to
recognize those or not simply with no
follow tags so just a reminder link use
is the reputation or equity pass from
one website to another so if you have a
link on another website and that website
is of high quality meaning their page
Authority their domain Authority is high
they have a lot of content you know
they're not spammy they're really rich
and they're relevant then you may want
to make sure that the link pointing from
that site to your site is a no follow so
that way that Google can recognize the
link from that site to your site and
basically that reputation is going to be
passed on to you okay so that's a do
follow versus a no follow and why would
we do a no follow well it depends it
really depends a lot of social media
platforms like Facebook have no follows
if you have a lot of content you may not
want to be pushing out a lot of new
follows it can actually look bad from an
external linking standpoint and so a lot
of sites are really particular about who
they want to pass link juice on to and
give credit for the link so it's a
business decision at the end of the day
there's really no hard fast rule here
except from an SEO perspective if I have
a site and I have a lot of external
links pointing outward to other sites
I'm going to be particular about who I
allow the search engine to follow and
what links I allow not to follow okay so
here's an example of what they look like
so do follow is simply just the hre
notice the no follow has the the tag
appended to it the hre tag with a no
follow so if the search engine's
crawling your site and they see that no
follow there they're not going to follow
that link and vice versa if there's a
link on another site pointing to yours
and there's a no follow there you're not
going to get credit the search engines
aren't going to pick up that link okay
so question two what is 301 redirect and
how is it different from a 302 redirect
so 31 redirects tell users in the search
engine specifically that an original
page has been moved and this is the key
word here permanently so permanently
moved we're going to explain that in a
minute so it's just moved from one page
to another and so if we don't have a
page anymore but we have a new page
let's just say you built a new website
with new URLs you want to make sure the
old page is pointing to the new page
with a 301 redirect so if a 301 redirect
is permanent then a 302 is temporary so
we want the search engines to recognize
that we have 301 permanent redirects in
place why because if we have temporary
then it might alert Google to not keep
that page in its search engine rankings
because it's temporary so why would
Google want to keep a temporary page or
even a page that is pointing to another
page on a temporary basis so they REM
May remove both pages from its index
okay but if we have something permanent
in place Google may say okay this page
is permanently linking to another page
or redirecting to another page therefore
or it's stable it's permanent we're
going to keep that new page in the index
and eventually remove the old page so
really something permanent is more
stable in the eyes of the search engine
something temporary may not be as stable
in the eyes of say Google and if they
don't see it as stable then they may
remove both pages from the index okay so
the idea is we want to be found in
Google search index and we get it
sometimes Pages go away for a variety of
reasons and if it does go away just make
sure you have a new page for it and that
new page is a 301 permanent redirect
okay so question three why are back
links important in SEO well we kind of
hinted on that a bit with the no follow
because if we have a link from another
website pointing to ours and that link
from that other website is really
relevant and and it has a high page and
domain Authority then it's going to
benefit us and so backlinks are
important because if we have backlinks
from high quality sites it's going to
improve the credibility of our site
especially if it's a do follow tag so
the search engines are going to
recognize the relationship between the
site that has a link pointing to us okay
so it's just going to build our
credibility it's going to increase
increase our domain Authority and then
the net effect of that is if we're
credible and we have high domain
Authority then that's going to increase
the rankings of our pages and when the
pages increase in ranking then we're
going to get more of a Lon share of the
traffic for certain keywords that our
pages are found for and if our pages are
found and getting traffic then because
we have increased rankings we're likely
going to have increased traffic and then
it's just a snowball effect so more
traffic leads to more engagement and
conversions so the whole idea for SEO is
remember you have an onpage strategy and
an off-page strategy building external
links is part of an off-page SEO
strategy and we want to make sure that
you know we are relevant in the form of
a link or in the form of content on
other highquality sites being on a high
quality site only benefits us because
again increases our D domain Authority
Google sees this is more relevant
therefore pages are going to benefit by
ranking higher and therefore when we
rank higher we get more traffic so it's
a snowball effect so having back links
is important because it snowballs all
the way through to conversions Okay so
what are the best practices to rank your
videos on YouTube this is a great
question really great question given the
importance of videos especially with SEO
cuz videos are found YouTube in itself
is a search engine so if we have a video
how are we going to get it to rank on
YouTube well first things first you
never want to put a video out there and
want it to rank if it's not engaging or
informative so make sure you go ahead
and follow the best practices of having
engaging in informative content in your
video now once you have that video in
place you want to optimize it and then
some of the key factors for optimizing
the video are you want to choose a title
that has high search volume and low
difficulty just as you would keyword for
example for a web page you want to
choose a title with a keyword in it that
has high volume and low difficulty I.E
low competition okay so you want a nice
ratio there and you know what you want
to choose a title it's going to get
people to watch the video too so it's
not all about just choosing a title just
for the sake of high volume you also
have to choose something that's relevant
that's going to be catchy as well and
then with that title goes the
description so you want a description
that's very relevant to your title okay
because most people aren't going to
click on a video just for the sake of
the title they're going to want to
probably get a sneak peek via the
description what it is so again you want
to optimize that description but make
sure the description is is just as
snazzy as the title okay you also want
to use accurate and relevant video tags
just as you would on Twitter Facebook
tag these videos okay so make sure your
title tag length doesn't exceed 100
characters because it will get chopped
off so again that goes back to just
writing something really short and to
the point that's going to grab
somebody's attention Okay you also want
to upload a captivating thumbnail
something that's relevant then that's
going to grab somebody's attention
mention and then again we set it similar
to the video tags we want to use
relevant hashtags again just as you
would with Twitter and Facebook go ahead
and throw some hashtags in there that
people could see because people search
via hashtagging and then this goes about
saying you did all the work created a
really great video it's engaging it's
informative you optimized it feel free
to promote your video on other social
media platforms okay don't just stick
with YouTube per se so the benefit here
is if you post it on Facebook or
LinkedIn or whatever platform of your
choice and it gets engagement people
click on the link go to YouTube they're
going to like it and then other people
are going to see that engagement they're
going to see how many people liked it or
how many subscribers you have so promote
your videos to help you with the ranking
of the video on YouTube so that does
play into it so go ahead and promote it
so other people can watch it like it
comment Etc and that's going to engage
other people to want to do the same so
what is mobile first indexing this is a
really important and timely question
mobile first indexing means Google's
just using mobile friendly content for
indexing and ranking websites so in
other words Google for example has two
Bots they have the traditional desktop
bot and they have a smartphone bot and
eventually everybody that has a website
is going to be migrated over to the
smartphone bot and so if that smartphone
bot goes to your website and starts
crawling what do you think they're
looking for their smartphone bot they're
looking for mobile friendly content if
it's not mobile friendly meaning the
page isn't designed for a smartphone
browser or let's just say the images are
way too large or you have to expand the
text just to read it you know a lot of
these these issues that somebody would
have just simply trying to read
something on a web page on their mobile
device Google's not going to grab that
content so you want to make sure it's
mobile friendly so it gets indexed and
so if your website has a responsive
design Google will rank your website
based on its performance on mobile
devices okay so you want to make sure
that your website is mobile friendly and
if you're in an interview and somebody
asked you this question you can even
take it a step further and say look I'm
going to measure how friendly my my
website is for mobile devices in Google
Google search console because Google
search console has a report that will
show you what pages on your website are
not mobile friendly and it's not a
guarantee but I could tell you if I'm
Google and I'm crawling your site with
my smartphone bot and that page or one
of my pages is not mobile friendly I'm
probably not going to index it or rank
it so you want to leverage that report
in Google search console to see what
pages are mobile friendly so that's a
little bonus for you to really impress
the interviewer who asked you this
question because how are you going to
know if one of your pages is mobile
friendly or not if you don't look at a
report so keep an eye on Google search
consoles mo mobile usability report okay
number six list down the most important
local SEO ranking factors okay so
organic local ranking is just as
important as anything else in organic
search because if you have a local
business you want to use the likes of
say Google my business to show up when
somebody types in you know looking for a
florist or you looking for a coffee shop
so what you want to do is you want to
create a web page for every product and
service okay you also want to opt for
your business listings on Google my
business and and there are plenty of
other local business directories out
there like Yelp for example or Bing even
has one so go ahead and also make sure
you have a business listing as well but
since Google in the United States has a
huge market share you want to start with
Google first you want to update your nap
citations on your website maintain
consistency of your nap okay so nap is
name address phone number so you want to
make sure that that's current and
consistent so if you have a number on
your website make sure it's the same
number on Google my business okay you
can embed a Google map on your website
you could certainly optimize the meta
tags and content not only on your web
pages but within your Google my business
directory so you can add your business
to other local directories like I
mentioned Yelp and then also just as
important op for reviews and ratings
okay so the more reviews that H you have
the better off you are okay so I always
say this with or with local search three
of the main factors and showing up for
local search on say Google is obviously
the keyword the second is the proximity
of where that person is and then third
is the reviews so you can't really
control the proximity but you can
control the keyword and you can control
the reviews to some degree so work hard
at getting reviews for your business but
at the same time you can certainly work
in some keywords let's just say for your
product and service pages on your
website but also you can translate that
over to Google my business okay so
working in those keywords making sureo
your your number your address your name
they're all consistent and and really
just spreading your the the business out
on other directories that's really all
these are really key factors for local
SEO okay so question number seven how to
avoid duplicate content getting
penalized for duplicate content so for
example if you have two different
versions of a web page you may result in
a duplicate content issue so it's just
SEO 101 you never want to have two two
or more pages with the same content so
what do we do well we can avoid this in
having Google penalize us by again
setting up a 301 redirect remember 301s
are permanent we can also use what they
call a canonical tag and a canonical tag
basically alerts the search engines as
to which page is the original okay so if
we have an original page we want to
point to that page with our canonical
tag and then the third option is opt for
preferred domain in Google search
console okay so if you have multiple
domains make sure you set up a primary
one in search console so those are ways
to work around it of this three I would
always go with the canonical tags
because that's just a tag that's going
to sit on the page it's going to alert
Google as to what the original is just
in case they get their hands on the
duplicate so all the pages that have the
same content are going to have the same
canonical tag pointing to one page so
again three ones are permanent you can
simply just redirect one to the other if
you end up having duplication or you can
just tell the search engines hey this is
the original page or you can go through
search console okay number eight what
are the tactics to increase a web page
speed okay so what is some of the
tactics well when you build a site
especially for mobile you want to keep
it as simple as possible what I mean by
simple as possible really I mean hey use
a simple website design don't get overly
creative if you will most websites all
websites have images you're not going to
be able to get around that but just make
sure you optimize your images in other
words don't have such a large image size
if you don't need something very large
don't have it okay you want to improve
server response time and what do we mean
by that well your site sitting on a
server somewhere you can own that server
or you can be renting it out from say
Amazon web services or let's just say
GoDaddy as your register they also have
web hosting well if you have have it on
say Go Daddy server you may be sharing
that server with other businesses and at
certain times of the day other
businesses may get a lot of traffic and
suck up a lot of bandwidth what is that
going to do that's going to reduce the
server response time for your site and
so you want to make sure you have a an
idea of you know what server your web
page your website is on and you want to
be able to can have some control over
that because if your server response is
slow that's going to slow down
everything else in terms of loading in
the browser and that's not going to be
good for SEO okay optimize your code
what you mean by optimiz minifying when
we say minifying we mean get rid of some
of the Redundant code if you have CSS
you know get rid of chop some of the get
rid of the JavaScript you're not using
so that's what we mean by optimizing
code reduce redirects okay ideally you
just want to have one redirect in place
you don't want to create a daisy chain
so to speak of redirecting and
redirecting after that that's never
going to bode well and it's going to
slow things down as well enable browser
caching so if you enable browser caching
basically if somebody comes back to the
page they've been on say two days ago
they're probably going to see a cash
version of that page and then off for
the content delivery Network as well so
these are some of the ways to reduce
page speed now if you're curious about
the page speed of your website you can
always go to Google's page speed
insights tool and all you have to do is
just Google page speed insights or even
just something generic like Google page
speed and you're going to get this tool
page speit insights and all you need to
do is just plug in a URL when you plug
in the URL Google's going to analyze the
URL for both mobile and desktop and so
here we could see Google gives a score
so we could see the score for mobile and
we can see the score for desktop just by
clicking on desktop and so here I can
see some of the issues that the site may
be having in terms of page low time for
their desktop if I flip over to mobile
you know here I could see some other
issues for example they have a server
static assets with efficient cash policy
now if you're not sure what the heck
that means you can always just click on
it and you can see some specifics here
and or you can just always Google it as
well uh here you got the reduce the
impact of third party code okay so
that's another thing uh reduce
JavaScript execution time so again going
back to a lot of some of the comments we
made about coding okay so sometimes too
much code or code not functioning as
well as it should will tend to slow down
the site okay so you can use pageb
insights you can always get a glimpse of
how pages are loading simply by also
going to for example Google analytics
under Behavior okay you can go to site
speed and if you click on overview Okay
Google what Google does is they do a
sampling of pages over time and in this
case based on 89 Page views they have an
average page load time and so you can
get a sense of how quick specific Pages
load your site overall simply by looking
at the site speed overview report in
Google analytics to get a sense of how
quick your pages are loading now there's
certain factors that do affect load time
so obviously the way the Pages built
with the code the images Etc but also
the browser each browser loads
differently okay so you want to take a
look at it by browser also by country
every country has a different network
you can be in the United States and have
worse network service than you do say in
you know co uh Ivory Coast in Africa
okay so really depends on the network
you're on so and also the page every
page is built differently so you want to
get a sense of what pages are loading
quicker and which pages are not you can
simply just go to page timings in Google
analytics and you get a sense of what
pages do not load fast which ones do and
maybe hone in on the pages that aren't
loading fast and address those pages
first okay so you have two tools at your
disposal one Google analytics and one
page speed insights okay so let's look
at question number nine here so when
should an individual Target short tail
and longtail keywords okay so remember
short tail are usually one to two
keywords very Broad in nature longtail
keywords maybe three four keywords in a
query or maybe an entire sentence those
are considered longtail keywords so
usually short tail keywords have higher
volume but also higher competition
longer tail keyword usually have lower
uh volume but also lower competition but
the great thing about about longtail
keywords the conversion rate will tend
to be a little bit higher than say a
short tail because it's less vague and
more specific so you can use short tail
keywords if you're trying to drive a lot
of visitors because those keywords are
going to be vague or Broad in nature
longtail keywords are used for targeted
Pages such as product pages and articles
so if you have a specific product with a
long name you can certainly optimize
that page for that product name again
the product name may have low volum
volume but if somebody types in exactly
that product name you show up the chance
of you them converting are going to be
very high so you don't have to always be
that specific with the product name but
try and be as specific as you possibly
can in order to get somebody to click on
your link in the search engine results
and get them over to your site to
convert okay so those are really the big
differences short tail very broad very
vague a lot of volume but also a lot of
competition but hey if you're ranking
for short tail keyword you're probably
going to get a lot of traffic the
conversion rates may not be as high as
something say longtail where hey maybe
you're just toned in on a few set number
of products and you're not care you
don't care of a lot about the traffic
you just care about getting the relevant
traffic to your site to convert okay
number 10 what are the important
elements to focus while developing a
website so we're talking in terms of SEO
okay so if somebody asked me this
question in an interview what am I going
to focus on while developing a website
well the answers are right here yes we
talked about mobile mobile is so
important because a lot of websites are
going to be indexed with Google
smartphone bod so mobile usability is
very important so we need to make sure
our website is responsive for mobile
just some basic practices when it comes
to site architecture navigation we want
to have a simple URL structure okay no
overly cumbersome navigation should
simply be clean and need okay if you
have five products okay maybe you have
uh in your navigation you have something
called products with all five listed or
you have all five products in the main
navigation the key is you just want to
make it clean and Ne easy for somebody
to find the the rule of thumb is if it's
good for the end user probably going to
be good for Google but if complicated
for the end User it's probably going to
be complicated for Google you always
want to create a Sit map now what is
that sitemap a sitemap is simply just a
formatted file with to that's includes
all your URLs and assets your images and
your videos they're going to be sitting
on your server as well so you want
Google or these these Bots to be able to
find your pages and assets and by the
way you want to take it a step further
and make sure you upload that site map
which is sitting in the root directory
meaning
domain.com sitemap.xml okay you want to
take that sitemap and make sure you
input that sitemap application in Google
search console that way Google search
console has a oneway ticket to grab the
elements in the sitemap another
important element to focus on while
developing a WIP side is having a
robot's text file and all A robot's text
file is it's like a lock I always say to
a house so if you lock a door in your
house nobody's going to be able to get
in that door so it's all a robots text
file is you're telling Google and these
other Bots that are coming ACR your site
what's locked and what's not not loed
meaning what they have access to what
they don't have access to so you want to
be able to make sure you have a robot's
text file if you're trying to not index
specific pages of your website because
if you tell Google don't crawl these
Pages or this directory they're not
going to get crawled if they don't get
crawled they're not going to get indexed
so robots text file is an important
element to focus on while you're
developing your website and while you're
developing your website it could be on a
you know in a directory just called new
website so you probably want to have new
website as the directory in the robot
text file and just to let Google no
don't go into this directory because
it's my new website I'm not ready to go
live yet so you don't want an indexed so
there a lot of reasons to have robots
text files that's the main reason
sitemap you want Google to get these
pages and assets quickly okay you want
to make sure that your site architecture
navigation is in order you want to make
sure your site is mobile friendly and
you also want to make sure you have
content on your website that's the key
cuz that's what's going to keep people
on the website and engaged and when I
say content I don't necessarily just
mean words I also mean videos I also
mean images you know something
interactive okay you want to keep people
engaged that's the key behind it trust
me if if an end user finds your side
engaging Google is likely going to find
your side engaging okay so those are
good brownie points to bring up if
somebody asks you this question in an
interview so just a recap here it's
important to have a better site
structure so that Bots can easily access
and N content okay with a responsive
design helps to make your website mobile
friendly and user friendly would also
increase the amount of time a user
spends on your website which may improve
your site's ranking sitemap is simply
just a file that helps search engine
Bots to understand the structure of the
website okay how many pages there are on
your website and where they located
along with the videos and images okay
and then the robots text just instructs
the search engine crawlers to understand
what pages should not be indexed okay
this is simply just a text file and it's
added to the root directory again think
like a door think of a lock okay you can
tell you can lock whatever doors you
want in your house then give it that way
