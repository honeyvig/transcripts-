hello everybody I'm really happy to
share my success with you all actually
the secret behind this success is the
team MDS conquer and family at three C's
important for success is consistency
commitment and Concord in the clear the
credit I wanted to give for MDS conquer
team the plan of action and their weekly
schedules helped me a lot I would like
to continue skon which has helped me
throughout my preparation for the
juniors who are preparing your joined a
team which is well planned and organized
and all you have to do is just study you
have to know your priorities and your
limitations and success will be behind
me a small amount of quality preparation
since j1 is more important than stoners
preparation in the last four months
MDS conquer family makes you to be
consistent day to day updates and
everything which we need to learn in the
Buddhism in my view people books are
very important follow them I would
request all the juniors to continue to
work hard and may you get on the success
you have to be very clear about your
goals know your priorities know your
limitations and then we paste in
persevere that's it
throughout my preparation there are many
ups and downs but sirs motivation and
timely guidance and circuit Elliston one
of the theories but correct Iranian loan
Renea we used to get that twice you know
what live in yourself you can succeed
you can succeed more than me I owe my
success to MDS conquer and I also wish
you all the best believe in yourself
never underestimate yourself you can do
anything and everything just believe in
that and go on with the preparation

hi everyone this is dr. Mary from Team
MDS conquer in this video we'll see
about a very very important defend
defense mechanism of our body that is
inflammation and because of this
inflammation only we are able to clear
any injuries agent or any foreign
material that is present in our body and
here we will see about the cells and
science of inflammation and the cells
include both the acute inflammatory
cells and the chronic inflammation
results so if you see the inflammation
inflammation is a local response of a
living that mammalian tissues and
because of this inflammation only this
body acts as a defense mechanism so it
will eliminate or limit the spread of
injurious agent so why inflammation is
important so what happens if there is no
inflammation you can see here these four
statements that is if there is no
inflammation the infectious agents would
go unchecked that means there is no cure
for the infectious diseases and the owns
will never heal as we have seen in the
own healing video also the there is a
stage called as inflammatory phase so
without this inflammatory phase the
humans will never heal and in practice
of medicine inappropriately triggered or
poorly controlled so we cannot maintain
the diseases like triggered and these
diseases are poorly controlled only
because if there is no inflammation the
injured agents or the tissues might
remain permanently in our body like a
decaying tissues so the hence
inflammation is a very important to a
body and this scientists are contributed
to the inflammation history of
inflammation and which are very
important to note so first we'll see
about the Cornelius Salas he Cornelius
elseis was the first to describe the
four cardinal signs of inflammation as
all of us know the four cardinal signs
of inflammation which includes rubra
tumor color i'm dollar so these four
cardinal signs of inflammation
were described by the Cornelius census
if you see this this Julius Kahn hang he
was first to use the microscope okay he
was first to use the microscope to
observe the inflamed blood vessels that
is one contribution and there is a one
more important process called as a dye
appearances we will see this dialysis in
the acute inflammatory slides so this
ayah pedasus term was given by Julius
Kahn him in John Hunter so John Hunter
he proposed that the inflammation is not
a disease okay he proposed that
inflammation is not a disease it is a
nonspecific response nonspecific
response was given by John Hunter if you
see this le matin mighty knock off he
discovered the phagocytosis okay he
contributed for the phagocytosis then
there all all watch you this is very
important he gave the fifth cardinal
sign that is loss of function so the
four cardinal signs were given by
Cornelius elseís whereas this Rudolf
what you give the fifth Gordon ensign
which is called as a loss of function
then at last but not the least
Thomas slavish and this thermos leavis
he gave the concept of chemical
substances that is the histamine okay he
gave the chemical con substances concept
which is called as histamine which is
very very important in the inflammation
then coming to the etiology of the
inflammation they may be the
inflammation may be of physical agents
like a heat cold or radiation chemical
agents like organic and inorganic agents
and infective agents like a bacterial
viruses I mean biological agents like
antigen and antibody reactions so this
is the etiology of the inflammation then
as of I told there are five signs of
inflammation so the first four are given
by Cornelius ulcers which includes heat
redness swelling pain pain is also
called as a dollar cell swelling is also
called tumor redness is called as a
ruber and heat is called as a
kallu and the fifth thing is loss of
function which is given by rudolf
virchow so these are the five cardinal
signs of inflammation coming to the
important thing here there are cells of
inflammation so here this gives the cell
list of cells
so first we'll see about the polymorphs
okay or the neutrophils so these cells
are the initial phagocytosis of bacteria
and foreign body so if any foreign body
enters into a body the initial phago
scientists cytosis is done by this
polymorphs and this is a acute
inflammatory cell this is very important
they can ask like which of the following
is acute inflammatory cell or a chronic
infrared reason so this polymorphism
acute inflammatory cells so the
mediators of this cells will be of
primary granules which includes MPO
lysozyme cationic proteins acid
hydrolases and elastics these are the
primary granules of mediators and a
secondary granules includes lysozyme
alkaline phosphate collagenous
lactoferrin tertiary granules includes
gelatin ease and capsule and the fourth
is the reactive oxygen metabolites so
these are the primary granules secondary
granules tertiary granules and reactive
oxygen metabolites which are axis and
mediators for this neutrophils the
second will be of monocyte or macrophage
and it also a by involves in bacterial
phagocytosis it is a chronic
inflammation and even it regulates a
lymphocyte response so in this thing the
fuses of the cells are very important
rather than this mediator features are
very very important so if you see the
mediators acid in neutral hydrolysis
cationic protein phospholipase
prostaglandins and interleukin 1
especially or the mediators for this
monocyte and macro C's then coming to
the lymphocyte it all of us know there
is humoral and cell mediated immune
responses it deserves a chronic
inflammatory cell and regulates the
macrophage response and the mediators
will be B cells and the T cells so
please remember the features of the cell
and you have to remember which cell
belongs to the chronic inflammation
and we sell very long still are cute
information then coming to the plasma
cell they are derived from the b-cells
and it is also a chronic inflammatory
cell and the mediators includes antibody
synthesis and secretion whereas is in
awful is enough it is very important it
you it acts in the allergic states and
parasitic infections and it is also a
chronic inflammatory cell and the
mediators includes reactor oxygen
metabolites lysosomal agents and the
prostaglandin are the mediators then
finally the peso fill at the mast cell
this receptor for the IgE molecules and
the electron dense granules and the
mediators will be histamine leukotriene
and the platelet activating factor so
she does these are the mediators of base
of Alana Marcella
then here the names given for the
macrophages were given in different
names
when based upon the presence in their
tissue so if you take this this
epithelioid cells or modified
macrophages seen in the granulomatous
inflammation then the cover cells which
is important it is seen in the lever a
little macrophages or type 3 new messiah
as naming man name indicates it is seen
in the lungs and the reticulum cells
please this is very important reticulum
selves in are present in the bone marrow
then tingle body macrophages which is a
it is also important present in the
lymph node then the literal cells of
splenic sinusoids osteoclast in the
board microglial say anything the brain
Langerhans cells are tend I take
histiocytes are seen in the skin then
Hofbauer cells of placenta so this is
also important and the Me's annual cells
are glow marisol so all these are the
macrophages which are given based on the
presence of the tissue then coming to
the inflammatory Jane cells you can see
the foreign body type of Jane's and okay
this foreign body type of Jane cells
will have a numerous nuclei and even
this nuclei are scattered throughout the
cytoplasm you can see in the picture
these are scattered throughout the site
of class
and this can be seen in the
granulomatous inflammation chronic
granulomatous inflammation and mostly
like leprosy and tuberculosis and the
second stage second cells are here the
lying hands type of cells
so here the nuclei are arranged around
the periphery in a harsh ooh in a ring
form or a harsh shaped or they can add
can be arranged in a cluster at the two
poles of the cell and these Langham's
cells can be seen in that tuberculosis
and the sarcoidosis then coming to the
Totten type of Suns they consist of a
vacuole ated cytoplasm these are very
important cytoplasm due to lipid content
and this is present in seen in xanthoma
please note down this is important so
these are the inflammatory dangers and
there is another type of inflammatory
sign change cell which is called as a a
scoffs and ask of cells are presenting
dramatic nodules and this ask of cells
which are called as a scoffs cells which
are seen in the rheumatic modules and
they are derived from the cardiac mr.
sikes
okay cardiac history or site so these
are the inflammatory dangers then coming
to the tumor Jane cells that humor Jane
cells will be of anaplastic cells which
are large cells with numerous hyper
chromatic nuclei and can be seen mostly
in the carcinomas and the sarcomas then
the Reed Steinberg cells generally a by
nucleated and feeling the hot skins
lymphoma and coming to osteoclast ik jnt
cells which are seen in the osteo class
tumor so these are the tumor Jane cells
of the inflammation so that's all about
the cells and signs of inflammation so I
hope everyone is strong they're strong
and always believe in yourself stay
positive and happy learning with and
these concur
