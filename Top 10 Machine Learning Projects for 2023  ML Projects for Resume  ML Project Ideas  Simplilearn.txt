foreign
field of machine learning is becoming
increasingly difficult the ideal way to
display your machine learning skill is
in the form of portfolio of data science
and machine learning projects a solid
portfolio of projects will illustrate
that you can utilize those machine
learning skills in your profile as well
projects like movie recommendation
system fake news detection and many more
are the best way to improve your early
programming skills you may have the
knowledge but putting it to the use what
is keep you competitive here are 10
machine learning projects that can
increase your portfolio and enable you
to acquire a job as a machine learning
engineer at number 10 we have loan
approval prediction system in this
machine learning project we will analyze
and make prediction about the loan
approval process of any person this is a
classification problem in which we must
determine whether or not the loan will
be approved a classification problem is
a predictive modeling problem that
predict a class label for a given
example of input data some
classification problem include spam
email cancer detection sentiment
analysis and many more you can check the
project link from the description box
below to understand classification
problem and how to build a loan
protection system at number nine we have
fake news detection system do you
believe in everything you read in social
media isn't it true that not all news is
true but how will you recognize fake
news ml is the answer you will able to
tell the difference between real and
fake news by practicing this project of
detecting face new this ml projects for
detecting fake news is concerned with
the fake news and the true news on our
data set we create our tfid vectorizer
with SQL the model is then fitted using
a passive aggressive classifier that has
been initialized finally the accuracy
score and the confusion Matrix indicate
how well our model performs the link for
the projects in the description box
below at number 8 we have personality
prediction system the idea is based on
determining an individual personality
using machine learning techniques a
person personality influences both his
personal and professional life nowadays
many companies are shortlisting
applicant based on their personality
which increases job efficiency because
the person is working on what he is good
at rather than what is compelled to do
in our study we attempted to combine
personality prediction system using
machine learning techniques such as SVD
name based and Logistics retention to
predict a personal personality and
talent prediction using phrase frequency
method this model or method allows users
to recognize their personality and
Technical abilities easily to learn

in the description box below at number
seven we have Parkinson disease system
percussion disease is a progressive
central nervous system element that
affects movement and cause tremors and
stiffness it comprises five stages and
affects more than one million worldwide
each other in this machine learning
project we will develop an svm model
using python modules scikit-learn numpy
and pandas and svm we will import the
data extract the features and label and
scale the features split the data set
design and space model and calculate the
model accuracy and at the end we will
check the Parkinson's disease for the
individual to learn about more this
project check the link in the
description box below at number six we
have text to speech converter
application the machine learning domain
of audio is undoubtedly cutting as right
now the majority of the application
available today are the commercial the
community is building several audio
specific open source framework and
algorithm other text-to-speech apis are
available for this project we will
utilize pytt sx3 PYT access 3 is a
python text to speech conversion
liability it operates offline unlike
other libraries and is compatible with
python 2 and python 3. before API
various pre-trained models were
accessible in Python but changing the
voice of volume was often difficult it
also needed additional computational
power to learn more about this project
check the link in the description box
below at number five we have speech
recognition system speech recognition
often known as speech to text is the
capacity of a machine or programmed to
recognize and transfer word is spoken
allowed into readable text mlsp's
recognition uses algorithms that models
speech in terms of both language and
sound to extract the more important
parts of the speech such as words
sentences and acoustic modeling is used
to identify the finance and the
phonetics on the speech for this project
we will utilize pyts X3 pytics3 is a
python text-to-speech conversion Library
it operates offline unlike other
libraries and is compatible with python
2 and python 3. to learn more about this
project check the link in the
description box below at number 4 we
have sentiment analysis sentiment
analysis also known as opinion mining is
a state forward process of determining
the author's feeling about attacks what
was the user intention when he or she
wrote something to determine what could
be personal information we employ a
variety of natural language processing
and text analysis technology we must
detect extract and quantify such
information from the text to enable
classification and data management in
this project we will use the Amazon
customer review data set for the
sentiment analysis check the link in the
description box below at number 3 we
have image classification using CNN deep
learning is a booming field currently
most projects and problem statement use
deep learning is and any sort of work
many of you like myself would choose a
conventional neural network as a deep
learning technique for answering any
computer vision problem statement in
this project we will use CNN to develop
an image processing project and learn
about its capabilities and why it has
become so popular we will go over each
stage of creating our CNN model and our
first spectacular project we will use
the CFI 10 data set for image
conspiration in this project to learn
more about this project check the link
in the description box below at number
two we have face recognition system
currently technology absolutely amazes
people with Incredible invention that
makes life easier and more comfortable
face recognition has shown to be the
least intrusive and fastest form of the
biometric verification over time this
project will use opencv and face
recognition libraries to create a face
detection system them opencv provides a
real-time computer vision tool library
and Hardware we can create amazing
real-time projects using opencv to learn
how to create face recognition system
for you check the link in the
description box below and last but not
the least we have movie recommendation
system almost everyone today use
technology to stream movies and
television show while figuring out what
to stream next can be disheartening
recommendation are often made based on a
viewer history and preferences this is
done through our machine learning and
can be a fun and the easy project for
the beginners new programmers can
practice by coding in either python or R
and with the data from the movie lens
data set generated by the more than 6000
users to learn how to create movie
recommendation system for yourself or
for your loved ones check the project in
the description box below so these were
the top 10 mL projects you can start
