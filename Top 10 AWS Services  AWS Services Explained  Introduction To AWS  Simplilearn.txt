hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on top AWS services at simply
learn now before you move on I request
you guys that do not forget to hit the
Subscribe button and click the Bell icon
for further updates so guys let's dive
straight into the top AWS services so
guys our first service is Amazon ec2
which stands for elastic compute Cloud
so basically what it is Amazon ec2
basically lets you rent virtual
computers which is servers in the cloud
you can use them to run your
applications without having to buy your
own physical servers and you'd be
questioning that why this service is so
important so guys the reason is that
businesses no longer need to invest in
expensive physical servers which can be
difficult to maintain and scale so ec2
allows companies to adjust their
computing power based on the current
needs ensuring they only pay for what
they use this flexibility helps
companies to save cost during low
traffic periods and manage high demand
during peak times all without worrying
about maintaining physical
infrastructure now let me propose a case
study where a company named Airbnb used
ec2 so guys this was the challenge
Airbnb experienced issues with scaling
during high traffic periods such as
holidays and during major events which
leading them to systems slowdowns and
potential
outages managing their own server was
very very costly and timec consuming as
they had to predict demand and manually
add capacity which often led to over and
under poisoning now I'll explain what
over and under poisoning is but let us
first look at what are the issues they
faced the first one they had the scaling
issue which means that high traffic
periods during holidays caused slowdowns
and outages then there was a problem of
server management managing physical
servers was very expensive and complex
then they had unpredictable demand it
was very hard to predict traffic spikes
which led them to capacity problems then
there was manual capacity addition it
also required manual intervention to
scale up during our resources and
finally they had over or under poisoning
which mean that often they had many
servers or few servers which led to
wasting resources or causing slowdowns
now what was the solution guys so after
moving to Amazon ec2 Airbnb could
automatically scale its infrastructure
Up and Down based on the demand ec2s
Pace as you go model allowed them to
avoid the cost of over provisioning and
handle Peak traffic seamlessly so guys
there is some statistics which I want to
share that Airbnb infrastructure scaled
up by 3x during the peak period using
ec2s autoscaling feature which led them
to zero downtime during high demand
Seasons they also reduce infrastructure
cost by 20% by paying only for the
capacity they needed now let us move to
our second service so guys our second
service is Amazon S3 or simple storage
service what it is guys basically Amazon
S3 is a cloud storage where businesses
can store and retrieve any amount of
data like documents videos and backups
why it was important guys basically S3
provides virtually unlimited Secure
Storage that automatically scales with
your needs it eliminates the need for
businesses to purchase and manage
physical storage Hardware S3 also
integrates easily with other AWS
Services making it a key component for
storing large amount of data like backup
application files or even media
streaming content its high durability is
around
99.99% which ensures that your data is
safe and always accessible now let us
look at a case study of Netflix so guys
during 2012 Netflix faced a massive
outage due to a failure in their data
storage system resulting in downtime
that caused them millions in Lost in
Revenue their existing infrastructure
could not handle the massive amount of
content that required constant
maintenance now there are some of the
problems with Netflix face
the first one is massive outage which
means that Netflix experienced a major
data storage failure in 2012 then they
had to go through a significant downtime
this outage resulted in millions of
dollars in Lost Revenue they had
inadequate infrastructure their existing
storage system couldn't handle the large
Content Volume then there was
scalability issues and also constant
maintenance the infrastructure struggled
to scale up with the growing user demand
and also caused them lot of problems now
after migrating to Amazon S3 Netflix was
able to store massive amount of data
S3's scalability allowed Netflix to
handle Global content distribution
without interruptions or data loss now
let me show you some statistics guys so
Netflix now streams to over 230 million
users globally with S3 handling 1,000
petabytes of video content approximately
the switch to S3 reduced Netflix data
loss risk to near zero and downtime
dropped by
90% so guys this was one of the case
study where Netflix used S3 and this was
the amazing result that they got now let
us see of the one of the next Amazon web
services which is Amazon RDS or Amazon
relational database service so what it
is guys RDS is a managed database
service that that takes care of setting
up maintaining and backing up databases
for you why it is important guys because
managing databases can be timec
consuming it involves tasks like
software updates backups and scaling RDS
automates these tasks freeing up
valuable time for businesses to focus on
the other core activities with features
like automated backups multizone
availability and easy scaling RDS helps
businesses to ensure their databases are
always running smoothly and securely
without the headache of manual
intervention now we'll take again the
example of Netflix so guys during this
phase also Netflix suffered from a
critical database outage leading to a
data corruption and millions in losses
managing on promises database was very
very difficult as backups scaling and
Disaster Recovery requires significant
resources and manual effort now these
are some of the problems which Netflix
faced the first one was critical
database outage where Netflix
experienced a major database failure
then they had to go through data
corruption where this outage caused
significant data corruption there was
massive losses because there was
incident resulted in millions of dollars
in losses then there were some on
promise challenges like managing their
on promised database was very complex
and inefficient and there was also lack
of automation because manual database
management increased the risk of failure
so guys by using Amazon's RDS Netflix
automated database backups patching and
scaling RDS multier deployment provided
High availability and fall tolerance
which ensure that data losses during the
failure outages are very very minimal
now there is some statistics that
Netflix reduces database recovery time
from hours to minutes in using RDS their
database operational cost also dropped
by 50% and due to the automated
management features so see how this
service was very useful for Netflix now
let us move ahead and try to understand
our next service which is AWS Lambda but
before we discuss this service just a
quick info guys simply learn has got
Cloud Architects master program you can
Master AWS Azure Google Cloud with the
cloud architect course you will build
expertise in AWS Microsoft Azure gcp
with the cloud architect certification
course you'll also receive exam vouchers
which is included on any Azure course
you will access official AWS author
self-learning content plus you'll also
Master Cloud architectural principles
design and also deploy a scalable
service on cloud platforms so guys hurry
up now and join the course the course
link is mentioned in the description box
now let us move ahead in discussion of
what is AWS Lambda so guys Lambda lets
you run your code in the cloud without
having to manage servers basically it
automatically scales up when needed and
only charges for the time your code runs
why it is important guys because Lambda
allows businesses to run code without
worrying about servers or infrastructure
paying only for the compute time used
this means companies can handle
fluctuating traffic without having to
over provision servers which means that
it will help in Saving cost and reducing
complexity Lambda is ideal for Ev driven
applications where tasks are triggered
based on the specific events such as a
file upload or a user action now there's
a company called irot guys so irot
needed to process large volumes of data
from millions of Roomba devices
worldwide managing servers to handle
this real-time data was very very
complex and expensive especially when
usage fluctuated now there was some
problem guys with this that they had
high data volume they had real time
processing problems they had a problem
of server management then the cost
challenges also came up and the
scalability issues then iroot adopted
AWS Lambda servoless architecture to
automatically Scale based on the number
of incoming requests they no longer had
to manage servers or pay for Ideal Time
as Lambda only charges for the exact
compute time used so guys what was a
result that iroot saw a 90% reduction in
infrastructure cost by using lambda's
paper use model Lambda processed over 20
million events per day scaling
effortlessly without manual intervention
so Guys these were the success story of
iroo by using the AWS Lambda service now
let us move ahead and discuss about our
next service which is Amazon cloudfront
so guys what is cloudfront basically
cloudfront is a Content delivery Network
that speeds up the delivery of websites
videos and other data to the users
around the world why it is important
guys because cloudfront reduces the time
it takes to deliver the content to users
particularly those located far from the
origin server this is crucial for
businesses that need to provide a fast
and seamless experience to Global
audiences whether it's delivering videos
web applications or large files
cloudfront ensures low latency access
improving the user satisfaction and
engagement so guys you have heard about
a company called slack slack once
experienced High latency and slow
message delivery for users located far
from their data centers this created
delays and inconsistent user experience
especially for for Global teams
collaborating in real time now let us
see what were the problems faced by
slack they had a problem of high latency
where I have told you that users far
from Slack's data center experience
significant delayed in massage
transmission the slow massage delivery
was there geographical impact was one of
the problem where the latency issues
were more pronounced for Global teams
collaborating across distant locations
then if we talk about realtime collab
collaboration were also hindered this
delayed caused challenges for teams that
rely on real-time communication which
finally affected and disrupting the
workflow and finally they had
inconsistent user experience so guys by
implementing Amazon's Cloud front slack
was able to cache and deliver content
from Edge location closer to the users
reducing latency and improving overall
performance Cloud front's integration
with AWS Shield also improved security
against potential dods attacks now after
using the service slack reduced the
latency by 50% globally providing
realtime messaging to 10 plus million
daily active users they also experienced
40% faster file uploads and improved
performance for International Teams so
guys this was a success story of slack
now let us move ahead and discuss about
our next service which is Amazon EBS or
elastic book store so guys what it is
basically Amazon EBS provides high
performance storage for application
running on ec2 instance it is like a
virtual hard drive that you can attach
to your ec2 server why it is important
guys because EBS offers fast reliable
and persistent storage for applications
that require consistent high performance
storage like databases or Big Data
applications businesses can scale
storage up or down as needed EBS
automatically backs up the data with
snapshots which ensures minimal downtime
and data loss so guys there's a company
called Expedia which faced performance
issues with their existing storage
system it struggled with to handle high
volume of transactions during Peak
booking times leading to slow response
times and frustrated customers they had
performance issues they had high
transaction volume problem like as I've
told you during the booking busy periods
then they had slow response time where
customer experienced slow response
affecting their ability to complete
bookings efficiently then they had the
problem during the peak booking they fa
challenges where the problem was
basically the performance issues now the
customers were also frustrated so what
xedia did was xedia migrated their
databases from Amazon EBS which offered
consistent low latency performance and
automatic scaling to meet high demand
and periods EBS also provided robust
snapshots backups for Disaster Recovery
as a result Expedia improved booking
transaction speeds by 35% ensuring fast
response time during their Peak Travel
Seasons they also increased their data
through output by 2x supporting millions
of daily searches queries without the
delays so this was a success story of
Expedia guys now You' be excited to know
the next success story so our next a
service is Amazon VPC or Amazon virtual
private Cloud what is Amazon VPC
basically VPC allows businesses to
create a secure private Network in the
AWS Cloud giving them control over how
their data and applications interact
with the internet why this is important
guys basically VPC provides businesses
with full control over their Cloud
Network including IP addresses subnets
and security it allows businesses to
securely connect their on promises
infrastructure to the cloud and ensures
that sensitive data is kept separate
from the public internet for Industries
like finance and Healthcare this level
of security is critical for meeting
Regulatory Compliance what was the
challenge guys so there's a company name
called Capital One Capital One needed a
secure and scalable Cloud solution to
manage its sensitive financial data
while meeting strict regulatory
requirements they on promises
infrastructure was expensive to maintain
and difficult to scale securely so guys
they had problems like need for security
scalability challenge they had a problem
of Regulatory Compliance they had high
maintenance cost and they it was very
difficult to scale securely so guys by
creating an isolated virtual private
Cloud Capital One securely migrated its
application and data to AWS VPC gave
them full control over their networking
environment ensuring compliance with
data privacy regulations while reducing
infrastructure costs Capital One
basically reduced their infrastructure
management cost by 30% by using the VPC
they achieved
99.99% of uptime for critical
applications thanks to secure scalable
crowd infrastructure of VPC so guys this
was one success story of Capital One now
let us look at another Amazon web
service which is Amazon IM am or Amazon
identity and access management what it
is guys basically I am lets businesses
control who can access their AWS
Resources by setting permissions and
user roles it is important because I
ensures that only authorized individuals
can access sensitive resources reducing
the risk of security breaches it's a
critical tool for controlling access in
large organizations where multiple teams
need different level of access access to
Cloud resources IM am also supports
multiactor authentication which adds an
extra level of security Now what is the
challenge guys which a company named
autodex faced so autodex had a global
Workforce and managing users to access
various AWS resources was becoming very
complex they needed a way to ensure that
only authorized users could access
sensitive data and resources while
maintaining security across the board so
the a problem of complex user access
management then there was a need for
authorized access then there was a
global Workforce challenge with Autodesk
faced then they had to also maintain
their security standards and they had a
problem of Access Control they needed a
solution on access control where a more
efficient and a scalable system was
required by Autodesk to simplify and
secure user access management across the
AWS resources
so guys Autodesk implemented AWS am to
manage permissions and access control
across their Global team with IM am they
created detailed user roles and policies
ensuring secure access based on need and
reducing the risk of data breaches so
guys Autodesk reduced unauthorized
access incidents by 60% after
implementing imem they decrease the time
spent on access management by 40% thanks
to the im's centralized control system
and that's was possible so this is how
Autodesk solve this problem now let us
move ahead and discuss about our next
service this is a very amazing service
guys its name is Amazon squis or Amazon
simple Q service basically Amazon sqs is
a messaging service that allows
components of systems to communicate
with each other by sending and receiving
messages between distributed
applications why it is important guys
because us allows systems to scale
independently by decoupling tasks
meaning different part of an application
can work on their own schedule without
being dependent on one another it's
useful for batch processing even driven
applications and microservices I know it
sounds bit of a technical jargon but
these are some of the scenarios where
sqs is used so guys you have heard about
this famous company called Disney plus
Disney plus face challenges in managing
their large volume of user request
especially during their release of
popular shows and movies handling
real-time requests without overloading
the system was a constant issue they
faced problem like high user request
volume realtime request handling then
system overload risk was there because
the platform constantly struggled with
the risk of system overload during Peak
viewing times scalability challenges
were also there because handling large
number of concurrent users require
required scalable solution and also
consistent user experience means they
ensure to have a smooth and
uninterrupted experience for all the
users during high demand periods which
was not happening now Disney plus
adopted Amazon sqs to queue and process
task efficiently decoupling their
application components this ensured that
tasks such as streaming requests were
processed smoothly even during high
traffic periods and finally Disney plus
handled over 1 million requests per
second during Peak streaming periods
with sqs ensuring no message was lost
the use of sqs improved systems
performance by 25% enabling Disney plus
to deliver uninterrupted streaming
experiences so guys this is a success
story of Disney plus now let us move
ahead and discuss about our final
service can you guess it guys yes it is
Amazon Dynamo DB Dynamo DB is a fully
managed nosql database service that is
fast and scalable it is ideal for
applications that need to handle large
amount of data with low latency so this
is the thing now you would be wondering
why Dynamo DB is important so guys
Dynamo DB is very essential for
applications that experience rapid
growth or fluctuating demand unlike the
traditional databases they might
struggle to keep up the volumes of
traffic but Dynamo DB can automatically
scale up to handle millions of requests
per second this is just something which
I told you let me elaborate this by the
story of a company called Lyft so guys
Lyft needed a database that could handle
millions of ride request in real time
but their traditional database systems
could not scale efficiently to meet the
demand leading to slow response time
during busy hours they had problem like
real-time data handling scaling
limitations they had they had high
request volume they had slow response
times and also they needed a scalable
solution for this problem now here comes
the Dynamo DB left switch to Amazon's
Dynamo DB which provided fast scalable
and serverless architecture with no SQL
database Services Dynamo DB ability to
handle millions of requests per second
ensure that lift could match drivers
with riders in real time without latency
now this is the thing which LIF has seen
left processed over 2 million ride
requests per day with Dynamo DB scaling
automatically to meet the peak demand
they improved the response time by 70%
ensuring a smooth experience for both
drivers and Riders this is how left
solved this problem what amazing service
