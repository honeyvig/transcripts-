hi everyone
the his doctor stricken from the team
MDS conquer now I am in front of you to
present the plan of action for 2019 2020
need preparation so we have been working
for this decent strategy from past two
to three months analyzing the situation
analysis of all 2017-2018 need cushions
followed by a long duration of talks
from the toppers of MDS conquer from
past four years and of course you have
the fifth batch of MDS conquer so I
welcome you all to the plan of action
like how we need to approach this how we
need to tackle this and what is the
ideology I mean like this video is
mainly focusing on the interns and of
course it's going to explain the game
plan throughout the year so I welcome
you all for this great dream 2020 batch
so what makes us unique like what makes
MDS conquer eunuch ok this this ideology
and strategy will give you some sort of
hint that ok this particular point of
your this way of preparation or
preparation with MDS conquer will be
definitely unique if we compare with the
rest other so what after BDS that's the
first question that will encounter
immediately after your final year done
with your university examinations
probably the result is out most probably
the happiest day of your life where you
are getting a tag where you're getting a
prefix that you are a doctor and what
after this finally what after PDS can be
the first question that we'll encounter
immediately after you were finally a
result so most probably this this video
presentation or this this analysis is
completely from my point of view or my
friends point of view or my juniors
point of view or my students point of
view from the past four years okay I
cannot generalize this but this is what
we feel from the analysis what I opted
the first thing is like I wanted I won't
have a lavish life I want to have
everything comfortable to me that's
that's what I feel like once what after
BDS I want a comfortable life effort I
want everything a lavish beautiful life
ok acceptable fur that what you need to
do you need to take ahead right because
be Dias now the competition in the
industry is very high so you need to
move the next step and the next
immediate question arises into the
aspirants brain or arises into the
person who is having a BDS tag is like
is only M Dias option that is left over
or is it is the best option above all
what is this this is true or false
because immediately once you're done
with your final near once the result is
out you just move around the PGS in the
department or you move around the staff
which are very close to you you talk
with them you talk with professors you
talk with H what is you know what is the
analysis what is the post consequences
in the dental field and this is what the
talks that regularly I used to have and
my friends used to have once they are
done with the final year and does the
internship probably many of you still
have it all these MDS is the one option
I feel like MDS is a good option and I
feel like MDS is a better option best
option I have my analysis for that why
should you go for MDS the next question
by is are there any things that makes
you to go for MDS you need to go for NPM
so there are many things ok there are
many things that many Jesus and MBS has
its own way because I have thousand
reasons because I have my seniors my
super seniors all of them are having
decent life I don't find any dentists
who are already done with their MDS
who's not making money I I find like
because I want I want to recruit a staff
from my coaching Center and past I mean
like three or four months back I was
just trying to find a good persons of
pay of iron like thirty to forty
thousand and it is very difficult for me
to find a good individual because
everyone are filled with their
occupancies
everyone they're busy with their lives
busy with the clinical practice busy
with the academician works in the
respective quality of sound I find very
difficulty in finding a good individual
who was done with MDS to work with me so
that is the only reason I can
that ambience is good they're making
money I have seen many of my seniors
super seniors making around 80 to 90 to
1 lakh few people they're making 1 to
1.5 lakh per month easily ok a big
clinical practice is required but they
are making money so there's not an issue
so the next option like I mean like
previously we used to have something
what does in a PPG or it can be an MSC
if you are a Maharashtra people you can
compare with MHC t if it is a Kerala
people you can compare with your Kerala
set K said Tamil Nadu PG so they're not
they we used to have lots of state
antonyms as previously probably 2 years
back but we don't have any such things
right now and the only single go exam is
your need so what is the advantage of
this need what is the disadvantage of
your state and turns us what is what is
the best thing that you find in any time
I won't explain the differences between
the need and your state entrance
probably not a PPC as majority of the
students are from Andhra and Telangana
we have specified it as a vpg but it's
state entrance
I think the first beautiful thing that I
want to focus on is the number of seats
you have almost all the GDC seats all
your 3d sees all your private college
seats and all your themed everything a
to jet whether it is a can be cap or C
category or a management quota
everything whether it is state
counseling G disease or an All India
Council in Genesys every GDC will come
under than share of need everything the
counseling goes with the need except
Ames and PGA so that is the first
advantage of giving a single go exam
like neat neat you have only one exam
and all the seats will be included so
that's the number of seats are very high
in the need and the second difference is
of course the stipend ok so if you
analyze the state counseling's majority
of your state councils I'm not talking
about the north not not states like
Haryana and Delhi but the less to state
if you analyze the for example if
analyzed the Andhra and Telangana States
tie friends stipend is around like 35 to
40 thousand not now it is increased to
45 40 to 45 etholon Ghana and 35 to 44
Andhra
okay so this is the margin of Steiff and
what you get when you obtain your seat
through the GDC counseling through the
state counseling whereas if you take you
all India counseling you how few
colleges like mallanna a few colleges
there many colleges in Haryana which
comes under the central government
category where they are going to paste a
friend off more than 80 thousand plus
now your max you will get 40 here by
also you will have double if you get if
you end up with a decent drag through
all India you you are going there many
colleges who are going to paste a friend
of 60 Plus 70 plus 80 plus even 90 plus
I feel like there is a second decent
advantage of the need exam particularly
for the twin state people so next one
next one very important one particularly
to analyze the people particularly the
in terms in specific is don't don't
don't pretend that don't don't analyze
that your PC life will be same as your
college don't don't see or like peep
into the PC life of your work college
pieces there's lots of difference
between the all-india GDC colleges
particularly there are very decent
number of colleges if you analyze the
top 10 or top 20 colleges the lifestyle
and the life and the mode of teaching I
mean like teaching and approach to the
patient is totally different I can't say
it is - - with compared with our private
colleges but there is lots of difference
for example you have few colleges where
the PZ is not approved the few colleges
Telangana we have two colleges at the
PCI to be like there they are on the
first batch or second batch of for
example if it is modularity this is
going to be the second batch okay they
don't know how the PZ life will be they
don't have proper seniors to guide on
and same goes with Annette's
which is present in Andhra probably this
is the second batch and saying goes with
GSM this is going to be the second batch
whole batch is going to be the second
batch so you don't have seniors who are
god GDC is a seniors who has a different
lifestyle or occupying different judice
is all over
and of course you don't have PV salsa
for example if you have a college of 10
to 12 years experience you have a PC
syndrome so indirectly or directly the
pieces are going to motivate and you
have an idea that ok this is what the
MDS lifestyle is this is what how the
pages will live around us and even talk
with them interact with them but there
are many colleges in India and there are
many aspirants in MDS conquer who are
watching this video I don't know how the
PG life is even if you know the PC life
of your private callers the PG life of
the private callers and the PC life of
the countermand colleges are totally
different and they are if you analyze
the top 5 or 6 or 10 now government
colleges they are damn high five
the very decent colleges good good in
teaching approach good in patient output
you can learn many things you can you
can move towards your passion you you
made out of passion
so apart from stipend there are many
other good advantages of being in
Genesis so don't ever compare you've
seen your life or a PC who is in or
college life with the virginal life what
you are going to approach in the future
if you have guts to prepare hard if you
have guts to work hard in your
internship or during your pace of
preparation where you want to convert
something zero that I mean like in and
around 0 to something which is very
decent probably a top 50 or 500
all-india rank and if you want to change
your life and lifestyle that is totally
different you can compile and I mean
like regularly interns used to talk with
PCs so before you talk and take a
suggestion from a PG in your college or
who is very close to you first analyze
that whether he is the right person or
not because if I can give a good example
because last year we we had a topper
like all India third ranker okay she
used to talk with many people in the
college ok few people they support her a
few people that disgrace her so it is
the analysis of the individual who is
undergoing the PG like for example if
you talk with me I'll be always positive
because I know what my vision is their
first few people in my same field or my
department who don't have proper vision
they may feel like PZ is a burden they
may feel like PZ is an order right now
so talk with people
who has a vision who has an analysis if
you directly go like for example we are
done with finally here you are about to
start your preparation and if you go
like you feel you you feel like okay my
H body is very close to me like for
example okay
oral surgery H what is very close to me
and you enter the oral surgery
department and you're talking with oral
surgery H body let's talk money he may
have 12 to 14 years experience probably
he may have done his entrance exam 12 to
14 years which is totally different 12
to 14 years back your entrance exam is
filling the blanks now it is an online
exam now it's a diagram based except now
it's a multiple choice exam now the
strategy of preparation is totally
different so it is a very bad move to
ask how to prepare to a person who has
cleared the entrance ten years back
properly even if you ask a person who
has cleared the interns three years back
for sure it's a bad move
so before you're taking suggestions and
before you're taking the inputs talk
with the fashion talk with immediate
senior who has cleared the entrance talk
with immediate senior who is good to you
talk with immediate senior who has a
positive energy means talking
positiveness there are few people who
always talk negative yeah I have done
but it's very difficult to do you can't
study you can't no don't talk with such
people talk with the people who always
motivate you that's what the primary
thing that I prefer to give as a
suggestion to you so this is what I feel
like regularly uses we compare the life
of the PZ and the respect to college and
feel like okay this fellow's life is
hectic I don't I am NOT interested in PZ
you talk with people who are not worthy
enough who are not fit for dentistry
okay there are few people who are not
fit for dentistry but they do the PG
through the management quota because if
they want to get married because further
for the satisfaction of the parents they
join so don't talk with such people's
don't talk with such people yeah so that
is a primary solution what I can give
they are already spoiled and they make
you spoil so that's what regularly
happen you have some example like when
you're when you're in your six standard
or like when you are in school if you
keeper wrote an apple inside a bunch of
apples all the apples will be rotten so
that's what the principle goes here so
talk with a person who has a vision talk
with a person who is really capable
enough who is good enough so don't talk
with the people who are not fit fit
industry so that's the first and decent
suggestion that I want to give you so if
you go further into detail like what MDS
conquer is what MDS conquer we work
smart I can give a simple definition of
smart smartness is something that you
have to modify according to the
situation means the situation it's tough
you need to modify yourself so that you
have to fit for the situation that's
what the smartness is now it's very good
there are many good great colleges in
India where they're going to pay a stye
friend of 80 to 90 thousand per month as
a PC student so in your PC you are good
you are going to get a stipend of 90
you're going to get a stipend of sixty
thousand forty thousand per month so
everyone is ready to do hard work so
what next what what is the move what is
the next thing that's going to make the
difference I feel like a smartness
that's going to make the difference how
do how to be smart and how to work in a
smarter way how to work in a simpler way
how do work on a like huge subject in a
limited time that's what MDS conquer is
all about
we as a team will make strategies which
are very smart and decent we make things
possible in a limited time that's what
we regularly work and that's what the
result of MDS conquer shows in the past
three years more than 120 CDC's in the
past three years and of course occupied
more than 60 percentage of the seats in
the things traits of Telugu both on
rental and if you analyze the top
rankers majority of their anchors and
majority of the seats are filled by MDS
conquer students so that's well that's
what the smart reparation and of course
after of these successful zone people
there are more than 60 percentage of
renter's interns doing things means they
have to be smart because they have a
limited time they have to be smart to
work on things so I'll be going to the
next slide so what is difference between
a fresher like intern and a repeater
repeater who like works on second time
third time fourth time
doing the same book tries for five times
but what is the basic difference I just
want to focus on the basic difference
the first basic difference is the stress
management stress management is okay
average or a minimal in an intern
whereas repeater how lots of pressure
they need to answer thousand people
every day one or other day they're going
to get a call from the house are you
going to make a seed this year we look
at a seat
we look at the GDC so these are the
common questions asked to the repeaters
by their friends or by their parents or
by the people surrounding them but
interns
I feel like measure out a few people you
don't have such stressful situations
probable in the last two months of
preparation you may have such things but
in the first phase where your stress
levels are low so whenever your stress
levels are low your efficiency or your
efficacy will be very high so that's
more important so in terms you have a
positive hand or the stress management
particularly in the first phase of the
preparation whereas repeaters they have
a bit more stress where and of course
the stress is very important because
stress is something like a force that's
going to drive you towards the success
and the second thing is touch with your
text books textbook reading is again an
important part if you start your
preparation too early so intense will
have an upper hand because you are
recently done with your final year and
you have some idea that okay this is
what the topic is for example if I
randomly queue some XYZ talking and
talking about the fish Jones you could
directly open your window and you can
just go with the okay that fish your
space but whereas repeater is going to
take it some time because there is a lap
of at least one one out of year with the
books so in terms are going to have an
upper hand because they are in touch
with the text books so you don't have a
lap period so you have good decent time
and of course it's going to work well in
the final exam to intern will have an
upper hand of ten marks if I mean like
if a new question is coming like which
is not there or which is not discussed
in the groups which was not discussed in
your pulse or any sort of mcq books if a
new question is coming the examination
hall there will be 10% there's more
chance for an intern to go with the
right answer when you compare with the
repeater the only reason is intern is in
touch with Xbox textbooks are the one
that's going to help you
in tough situations and second one the
only disadvantage according to me is the
time management time okay limited time
for interns you have to go for your
clinics you have to manage the clinics
probably you'll be free by four o'clock
max you can work up to four to five
hours per day probably you're working
times may increase on the weekends
Saturday and probably on Sunday and of
course internship as we feel like is a
time to get fun it's a time where you
enjoy a lot more parties on weekends so
time management is a difficult so people
who comes out I'm people who give damn
respect to time who are interns will
definitely succeed because I have more
than 50 to 60 odd stories or right now
in joining GD C's with no time lap just
internship done right now they're in
Genesis and I'm enjoying the beautiful
lifestyle so time management is the only
difficult issue that the intense should
give some sort of concern that is more
important time management discipline
towards the time and importance towards
the time is very very important because
I can say simply that time is the only
reversible thing on the earth even if it
is a cardiac arrest you can do CPR and
you can save the patient if it is in a
limited time like five five minutes or
ten minutes you can give a try
you can do CPR and you can you can make
the things irreversible means partially
your real reversible in our career we
are going with a partial reversible of
death also but time once it is done it
is irreversible so I feel like all the
students of MDS concurred were planning
to decide be a part of MDS conquer I
want you to give a damn respect to the
time time is more than god I feel so
time is more important so I hope you
understand the ideology of in an intern
with a repeater so next goes is the aims
and object use of this video or the aims
and objectives of two two two two zero
two zero batch or aims and objectives of
MDS conquer of both you and me
so my team aim and objective is to
analyte more interns about them
of preparation encourage them and drive
them in a positive direction with a
positive attitude towards their goals
and towards the success zone to make
their family stand well in the society
within the boundary of dentistry so this
is the primary object of team MDS
conquer and the secondary object is very
clear that we want to make this stuff as
easy as possible and we want to make
things as matte as possible of course
smart work plus hard work is the best
tagline that every aspirant once they
are done with the what done with that
part with MDS conquered they regularly
do this dark for the team so we team we
the primary and the secondary objects of
this always be positive work hard with
add some smartness and some innovation
to your work and be successful among the
crowd so that's what the aim and
objective of my team and myself is and
coming to the second part what is your
aim and object you have something in
your brain or you have something in your
heart who has entered this room or who
has opened this link you have something
some positiveness or something like I
have to get this I have to do this I
have to make this I want a best or I
want to get all India first into two
zero two zero I want to get a GD scene
two zero two zero you have something
your dream right a particular department
a particular call is at least a
particular place lavish life decent
stipend good lifestyle and makes your
parents happen so you may have something
among this like or any other thing in
your brain before you are clicking or
opening this video link so probably I
feel like that is the main aim and
objective of you so what is a game plan
strategy of MDS conquer keep on changes
because I said like smartness is
something that keep on changes around
based upon the surroundings and
situation so I'll give a tentative I
of what I'm going to do once you're a
part of India's conquered you will
hopefully you will catch up the
frequency of my ideology I don't want to
comment the rest of the people who are
guiding the aspirins and XYZ but I want
to give I want to just give an analysis
simple simple logical analysis okay
before you start anything you will be
slow for example initial days where you
are cutting your class 1 class 2
cavities on the patient probably in the
third year or the initial stages of your
final year you will get slow phase
probably for cutting a cavity of class 1
you may take 10 to 15 minutes base
application followed by restoration
adjustment I mean properly you may take
30 to 40 minutes if it is your first
cavity I'm just giving an average
analysis so once you are done with 10
cavities probably the 30 minutes make
hard drop to 20 minutes 40 cavities it
may turn off to ten minutes if it is
more than 100 cavities like it can be in
your internship or in your private
practice after media's or after MDS if
you are done with 100 or 200 plus
probably a class one cavity or a pit and
features sealant initial removal it's
going to take not more than five minutes
true right accepted everyone will accept
this but I don't know why majority of
you people will prefer a shade you'll
which is always constant like for
example if you're starting with an
initial subject some X for example I
will take an ascend or initial face you
will take some time okay take end of two
weeks you can take come operative okay
two weeks you can take but once you are
on fire and your catch-up in the
frequency you are able to work for more
than five to eight hours per day you
have good ample amount of time why you
want to go with the same face when the
train is starting from its velocity like
zero in a particular day
enough time in in the first few 10 or 15
seconds the velocity will slowly
increases the speed will slowly
increases but once it catch up the
frequency it never goes in the same
phase that's what I feel so the mode of
schedule and MDS conquer is unique it
changes according to the situation if I
feel like okay these people are on track
and these people are really working hard
and I feel like if you're on track your
your schedule will go fast if I feel
like you're off track a schedule will go
down for example in the cons I feel like
you're good we can go fast oral
pathology oral medicine yeah you're done
in Puryear you're done the oral
pathology is same subject in the final
year in oral medicine yeah I can go fast
pharmacology which was done two years
back in your second year with lots of
struggle I go slow
microbiology toughest subject I go slow
biochemistry I feel it's too hard
lots of cycles and lots of things to do
I'll go slow dental Anatomy dental
astrology yes done in the first year
done in second year directly or
indirectly done in third year yeah of
course down in finally here in your pedo
operative everywhere so I'll go a bit
slow but a bit fast so that is that's
what a smart preparation I feel like can
regularly what we what people used to do
is like okay biochemistry 10 days
operate or 10 days end or 10 days speed
or 10 days pharmacology tenders it's
very difficult to complete pharmacology
in 10 days but it's very easy to
complete your endo in 10 days so your
preparation phase is not logical way it
should be completely smart further you
need to have a mentor who thinks and
analyzes the thing according to the
situation for example Jan second week is
a festival week for majority of us will
modify the schedule will give a break
I can't tell you like Jan first week to
second week
pharmacology finished pharmacology no I
go according to the things if it is a
really wanted thing like you you have a
big festival on Jan like for example you
have big festival and kisara we will
will give a good break we will give a
break for that so that's what the
ideology here that's what like called a
smart preparation modifying according to
the surroundings and modifying according
to the situations is what the basic game
plan of MDS concurrent there will be
lots of modifications if things are
getting worst you'll have a modification
for example recently the best example of
smartness of MDS concur I can give you
is your seniors exam is pre pounded by
21 days my tag line to the last schedule
is the schedule will be decided basing
upon the notification date of NB or NIT
so this is what the tag line I regularly
used to give but I used to see so many
off and on test series is there where
they they go with a decent shuttle over
the year so proponent exam was 321 days
people were in hurry then I modified the
shuttle III said like I did it depends
upon the date of examination that we
have to modify the schedule that's what
called as a smartness so please guys
will go in a smarter way will work in a
smarter way we modify according to the
situations we tackle things in a better
way compared to any other in India for
sure
okay so maybe probably it may take two
or three months for the team - I mean
like install this smartness in your
brains while you're going ahead are
approaching towards the subject so my
game plan before discussing my game
planner I just want to talk about the
plan of actions so the first thing is
like priority I can give a good example
for this okay I have one of my friend
she's very good at subject but not
interested in peace event she was
in the internship she she was done with
the internship and by force she got
married she moved to other state where
she started her preparation cracked the
entrance in the first round but
unfortunately his husband got a good
opportunity in u.s. and they have
shifted two years so she got a good she
got a seat but she was not in a position
to handle or take that seat and she
moved to us where she started preparing
for env Part one and Part two she done
she was done with and B Part one Part
two and by the time she was done with
and B part 1 part 2 again her husband
got a better option in India and they
shifted back to India her post
preparation was failed even after
getting seed after clearing part 1 part
2 and B she again failed because the
priorities husband priorities not family
it's not the carrier then moved to India
again planned the preparation but
unfortunately she was pregnant and the
date of examination was just postponed
and it was just sinking the pregnancy
date
even after good hard work again she was
a failure because priority is her family
again finally again she started
preparing very hard being a part of MDS
conquer but now her priority is her
carrier she explained the things very
clear to her husband and she called her
mother to take the responsibility of her
child and her priority for this time is
completely ambience and right now she is
MDS first year in one of the good
callers in inter department I think it's
a decent end it's the best example for
priority I can give first time the
priorities enjoyment it's not luck PG
she enjoyed an internship good his
success
she successful with her priority the
second year she worked hard but her
priorities husband okay and third year
her priority is not MDS our priority is
again family she moved to India her
priority next round is her pregnancy her
priority in the last round is MDS and of
course she's with him so priority is
very important whether entertainment is
in internship is your priority whether
your family is your priority whether
your career is your priority so even
priorities I feel like I'm there should
come first at least for the people who
are unmarried
unfortunately India is a place where we
have few things to follow according to
the customs and the cultures here so we
can't escape from such things but
probably if you're an intern and if
you're unmarried I feel like you should
keep your MDS as your first priority
second thing you need to set your goals
I like majority of the people who have
extended to 32nd minute of this video
probably will definitely have something
in their heart and drain like I have to
be this I have to do this I have to be
the all-india first I have to get a GED
see that's your goal simple don't tell
anyone
just keep it in your heart probably on
the day of success meet you can share
this and your attitude your attitude is
very important people who are very
dedicated to the preparation and people
who give damn concern to the preparation
the way the thing the way they act is
totally different I can't wait I mean
the people around them can sense ok
these people are preparing so better not
to disturb them
so your attitude and your respect
towards the preparation is very
important because the preparation is a
phase where it's going to decide whether
you want to be an endodontist whether
you will be an orthodontist or whether
you will be a periodontist or an or
through pathologist so it has a greater
impact on your professional career in
the second half an inner honest a
clinician will have a different life
non-clinician will have a different life
probably mostly so preparation is the
one that's going to decide your fate the
GDC student will have a different
attitude the private college student
will have a different attitude and apart
from the money you spend a deem college
student will have a different attitude
so it's the preparation phase attitude
that's going to decide your second half
of the life so you need to be grand
to the subject one you're doing with it
of course you need to learn new things I
mean you have learn something until
probably 50% this in your various
lifestyle so you need to learn new
things and you need to revise the things
which you have already learned basic
things for example surgery you know
blocks everything you know about blocks
you have to revise them and you need to
learn some new things so that's what the
last two lines the new things to be
learned okay and things which are
already learned you have to revise them
so that's what I feel and things to be
followed for the MDS conquer students
probably how 12 to 15 months of
preparation from now it may very few
people the end of the preparation phase
in the middle few people the end of the
preparation phase in the last four
months in the last eight months in the
last two months in the last one one so
the day very but you can enter any more
like the the modes can be divided in
mb/s concurrent to test mode one day
mode t20 mode and final mode so you can
enter like you can enter any of these
modes like I mean initially will go over
the test mode followed by you can enter
one day mode or 22 anymore or in the or
in the final amount so so probably for
the first time I am along with my team
we are planning to go ahead with four to
five rounds of revision I feel like
revision is the one that's going to make
you more confident in the examination
hall and your confidence levels is the
only driving force that's going to make
you stand in the septic crowd with a
decent success so I feel like we'll go
with four to five rounds of revision for
this patch dream 2020 which is a dream
patch for me so four to five rounds of
revision is the first time that we are
planning we want you guys to work hard
probably it will take 10 to 15 days for
us to catch up the frequency once you
catch up the frequency will go fast hand
in hand driving each and every one so
that's what the plan of action so the
test mode we are planning for six to
eight months
one-day mode for three to four months
t20 mode will be probably for two to
three months and
we'll be in the range of 15 to 30 days
so what we do is the test mode is like I
just want to go more with the clear-cut
concepts we learn concepts we learn
subject so apart from this we'll make
material ready okay will will will make
our notice will organize the things you
know underline the things we'll have
textbook reading so the lots of MAGIX
that are going to takes place in this
decent mode where we need to work very
hard the primary thing is like you have
to prepare well means you have to
prepare your notes errs underline the
things write everything in a systemic
way so that it will be easy for you to
tackle the same subject in one day mode
and in the test mode or in the final
mode so that's what the analysis is all
about okay the first time you have a
subject vise discussions preparations
videos textbook readings so the many
things that go we will deal with the
shortcuts and everything you organize
them prepare the notes and get ready for
the one day mode one day mode will have
a subject why is revision related
repeats how to tackle the things
everything and followed by key 20 mode
where you have your stress reduction
therapies motivation building up your
confidence levels dealing the subjects
with more exams repeats then lots of
things I will be explaining further once
we are done with the first half
preparation and make a note the unique
strategy of MDS conquer is we go in
cycles for example right now your
schedule will start with end oh okay
it goes with operative it goes with all
the leftover 23 subjects so again it
start with the second of end up with the
second run so you can enter the test
series or a part of MD can be a part of
MDS conquer at any point you can come
with an operator so after all the
subjects are done again will come with
an operator so we will have four to five
rounds of revision so don't worry even
if you are late for this test series or
if you're late for this coaching aspect
because the things will go here in
rounds in cycles for example it is
similar to your day and night cycle if
you sleep at
you'll get the night I get back you
sleep in the morning you'll get your
morning again back same goes with the
cycles of MDS conquer you will have four
to five rounds of cycle so if you enter
in the middle also there's not an issue
you can start your preparation at any
point in these cycles because it goes
and comes to the same subject and one
point so be positive so don't ever feel
that I am late for this I'm late for
this I'm all don't ever do that you're
in once you are in you will encounter
the same subject in the second or third
round of yeah you have four or five
rounds of revision so you can enter the
cycle at any point in the first round or
in the second round or in the third
round or in the fourth of the final
round I hope it is very clear because
people regularly used to ask me like we
are done with two subjects what we need
to do next you will get that yeah it
goes in cycles if you under a Pareto and
if you miss endo endo will come again if
you if you under it operator and if you
miss like your endo it will come again
so that's what that's what I say like
don't worry you can enter this part of
test series or you can enter ambe's
conquer it anytime because we go in
cycles we revised the same subject we
tackle the things in a very simpler and
easiest way will will give you the time
analysis a precise schedule for each and
every individual so that's what the
unique property that a Don 70s conquered
to a meta success so this is what the
strategy levels these are the subjects
we are planning to have three to four or
four to five rounds of revision basing
upon the date of examination few times
the exam may get postponed so that we
can plan further if you may a few times
should get pre pondered so according to
that the last mode varies but ok luckily
because the notification will come three
three months prior so we can modify the
brush preparations according to that
right so I mean like what are the mode
of your examinations in does and does
the lifestyle starting starting your
preparation what is the first exam you
will encounter the first exam that you
people are going to encounter is your
number aims 2019 so now
my name's 2019 is the first exam that
you people are going to take probably it
will be in the number second week so
immediately your next thing will be
December 2000 and and sorry it's not
2018 it's 2019 it may vary it may go it
may go in December 2019 of it can be in
giant 2020 so make sure you should
finish your task by neat December 2019
you have all these subjects are I hope
you know these subjects okay six
subjects in the first year I'll be
discussing all these things not much
important so your first exam is going to
be your number aims that's a trailer
exam followed by your main exam is going
to be your December 2019 eight exam so
I'll be focusing on the basic
differences between the need and aims
which are the exams that probably you
will encounter probably your PGI
December is all about you Josh if it's
nowhere related your MD SN it may
coincidence you are meet exam so I I
don't want to stress you people to go
for December PG because it's not for MDS
first of all and second thing it may
coincidence your need examined it's
going to spoil your need preparation I
feel like need is more important than to
pgoj our ship so now I'll be discussing
about the aims you have you'll have a
mess ten seats probably I mean like
probably five will go for the
reservation category and five will go
for the open category number of
questions in Ames paper will be 90
sorting and your time duration is 90
minutes so you will have minus 1/3
negative marking each question you need
to solve in one minutes properly you
should complete in 50 seconds you'll
have 20 to 30 diagram based questions
and 60 to 65 regular questions and where
you need to focus on you need to focus
more on the clinicals that's I feel like
if you analyze last five we have Snead
peppers an 80 percentage of your
chemical questions will be from oral
surgery cons endo perio or torpedo
though implants and oral medicine and
modern pathology and probably all of
your diagram based questions 20 to 30
are from the clinical subjects just make
a note before we change or more to the
aims reparation will have a special
flashes on it you will have probably 20
to 30 marking zones which are going to
be the highest number of exams by any
offline or online coaching center in
India so we have lots of stuff to learn
regarding the aims don't worry about
that I'm just giving an idea that how
you need to analyze the aims and the
mode of preparation for aims in specific
if you are planning for next is I need
to talk much about this neat neat it's
going to include all the GD C's all the
private colleges all the all the deemed
everything even army coops and few
government jobs they prefer need as a
primary option the total number of
questions are 120 you have three hours
180 minutes and probably will have minus
1/4 negative marking according to 2017
need curriculum so each question you
need to handle in 45 seconds probably
you should finish each question in 40
seconds means you should be very fast
and accurate so for that you need to
have large bulk of practice probably the
only coaching center which provides five
to six times more mock exams five to six
times more online Pepper's practice
papers net practice and everything is
MDS concur we are planning to provide
more than 400 to 500 examinations before
you give your 2019 December need exam
and coming to your diagram based
questions the diagram based questions
are very less need when you compare with
your aims and mostly they will go for
the regular questions and what I like
let me prefer the basic books that MDS
conquer students should carry it's not
general it is MDS conquered because I
said we work smart we modify according
to the situation so the basic books are
the twelfth edition of dental pulse
which is not yet released probably it
will take one or two months you can see
the date of the video
that was posted on for now twelth
edition is not released it will be
released so bait for the twelth edition
to be released I will be posting when
the twelth Edition is out I'll be I'll
be posting on the group so then you can
bye for now guys please go with the
dentist clinicals please make a note is
clinical science stressing on clinicals
dentist you have to go with the clinical
volumes ok basics is your option these
are the books that you need to carry to
be a part of MDS conquer dentists I
prefer only clinicals so of course
power-play 5th edition we are going to
provide probably the fifth edition will
be out in the month of April clearly
mentioning I'm just elaborating the word
powerplay I hope few guys that you know
what is the meaning of power playing the
cricket so power playing the cricket is
something a face a face in the in the
cricket match where you can score more
runs so similarly goes with the power
play books of MDS conquer a face where
these books are required which are going
to increase your efficiency which are
going to increase your scores so these
books will be released in the April
probably 90 95 percentage of cases power
to the books are not requiring your
first strong that is a test mode it will
be required in your one day more than
t20 mode more because you don't have
power play something called isn't a
power play no cricket test series
whereas you will have power plan your
oneness and your teeth on this ok same
goes with this and we are coming out
this year with the MDS conquer play
cards or smart cards ok I'll be
explaining what is this smart cards and
play cards in your in your respective
groups ok don't worry about that and I
want you guys to carry this fee beyond
vivek jane book ok which is a decent
book very important for subjects like an
autumn a physiology and biochemistry and
few things in forensic no need to read
the complete book ok we go smart right
we always smart and i will be explaining
what things to be done which pages to be
done which MCQs to be done everything
will be explained in a smarter way in
the group so don't worry by the book
I'll be telling you water read and what
water it because need smart prepare
should require and analyze the situation
and we have to decide what to read and
what not to read and I feel like you
need to have a decent high five books
which are very good with all your
glitters your multi colors highlighters
so probably ten classmate books which
are going to be your golden books for
your preparation they're more important
in the first phase where you need to
write notes as include everything
underline highlight because you need to
revise them for the second round third
round and the fourth round I hope these
are the books that you need to carry if
you want to be part of MBAs conquer a
few modifications and few other books
that I will be suggesting as we go deep
into the preparation so this is what the
blueprint of neat according to 2017
guidelines so almost all the subjects
they're going to carry 14 marks each but
I want to elaborate each and everything
in detail according to the books what we
have right now in the market according
to the subjects what we have learned
right now in our various lifestyles so
first subject if you analyze in detail
general and auto me okay make a note you
have embryology and histology I have
seen many questions in embryology and
astrology which are very tough so I feel
like the material what we have right now
or the the things what we have right now
it's very difficult for us to handle the
things so you need to add an extra stuff
of your embryology and histology these
extra stuff will be provided by me as
conquering a smarter and easier way so
you need to analyze this and if you take
biochemistry is going to carry seven
marks and your physiology is going to
carry seven marks your dental Anatomy is
going to carry seven embryology and
histology dental part will going to
carry seven jungle path seven and your
microbiology is going to 7 general
pharmacology 7 your dental form or
colleges 7 dental materials is going to
carry 14
general medicine 14 general surgery 14
oral pathology 7 and oral microbiology
is going to carry 700 medicine 7
radiology 8 peda and prevent 214
orthodontics 14 parry or 14
rhasta crown and bridge with implants 14
ender 7 operator 7 oral surgery 14 and
public health industry 14 see this is
what the rough analysis and there are
many things that are missing in your
basic books what we regularly go ahead
quarter the present in the market so
there are many things which are missing
which will be covered by your PP books
so I send like P P books are scoring one
sort of smarter books so it's going to
cover all the things which are missing
in your regular basic books for the
preparation your group is going to cover
the rest our stuff so be positive we
will have the best stuff and the best
mode of preparation probably in the
upcoming 12 to 15 months and probably on
the next day of exam you will be with a
smile on your face and probably the
result day is going to be the happiest
day of your life so this is what the
share deal of MDS conquers in the in the
in the first mode or the first power
play I am planning to cover these
subjects I have clearly given the
subjects the date of examinations and
the weight is of this particular subject
in your final exam want to explain in
details so 90 buctober
on the day of Dussehra the greatest day
starts good things so we are planning to
initially start the proceedings so
probably we will have small orientation
classes on 2020 first on online solving
your doubts and regularly ask questions
and we will be starting the classes on
22nd that is Monday so we'll be starting
with the end of okay so we'll be
starting with the end o and probably end
o I have given 14 days my intention is
very clear because initial time initial
start should be slow so that's the only
reason I have given 14 days for endure
by followed by seven days for each every
week so it's going to take at least like
ten to seven days for you to catch up
the frequency of MDS conquer once you
catch up the frequency for the first
exam of endo it's very easy for us to
handle you in a better way so twenty
second your classes are going to start
with the endo and forth number is going
to be your first exam
of 120 marks and endo is going to carry
seven marks out of 214 your name
so next verse is with the conservative
dentistry part 1 and followed by how
part 2 simultaneously you have dental
materials part 1 and part 2 so because
if you talk about operator you how your
amalgam you have your dental cements not
at filling gold composites casting
allows all at a part of dental materials
again a part of comes away to dentistry
so that's the reason why we have divided
in such a way so there are few subjects
in a smarter way you have to handle them
as a combo for example if it is like
orthopedic major different questions in
a final exam will be a combination of
author and Peter so you have to learn
ortho and para as a comp oh you have to
learn operative dentistry and dental
materials as a combo so that majority of
the subject will be common to both this
both both the outcomes so this week
syllabus is going to carry seven out of
240 in the need operative dentistry -
part two and dental metals is going to
carry seven out of 240 or dental
materials three is going to carry seven
out of 240 so you have oral Anatomy then
after seven out of 240 or less twelve is
a seven out of 240 radiologists seven
out of 244 on sick medicine and
odontology will carry three out of 240
totally you are going to have a mock
exam on Jan 6 on fifty-two marks
probably we're almost done with 1/4 to
one-fifth of the syllabus it's 240 so we
are done with all 52 marks so it's
already done with 1/4 or 1/5 of the
syllabus by Jan phosphate so this is
what the plan of action for the upcoming
2 months ok so I hope you're clear so
according to the situation we'll be
modifying and we'll increase the pace of
the preparation once your seniors are
done with your exams they're properly
there and they may be done with the exam
on December 14th so once we cross the
December 14th will will may extend our
time up to Jan 6 once a mark is done so
we'll take a break of two to three days
that will restart the things fast and
the frequency or the driving force will
be increasing on properly
so by John I want all you got all of you
guys to catch up the frequency try to
work hard increase the amount of time
that you spend with the books initial it
may be one or two hours so as weeks
preceding as months preceding you need
to increase your time with the book may
should hit 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 6 to 7
you need to conserve your times like
initially I mean like the regular smart
solution that I can give is like your
majority of your colleges may start at 9
o'clock few colleges they start at 8
that but up to 10:30 11 o'clock you will
not have okay so that's the best time
bed don't don't chitchat much
have fun have a good talks but keep your
book in front of luck try to spend your
time with the book so if you inculcate
such things your preparation is going to
be smooth smart and useful so coming in
detail about dream 2020 batch of the
things what we are going to provide you
are going to provide a test series which
contain the highest number in any sort
of online test series until now in India
more than 500 exams that's the unique
way
and daily you are going to have what sub
discussions you're going to have lots of
smart work you have smart exam pattern
and analysis in the in our site okay you
have one more video that is available on
our YouTube channel you can see how the
site works the site is very recent it's
going to give all self analysis you can
clearly observe in every analysis in the
side that so there's a special feature
of the site we have taken lots of
consent while preparing the side you
have video based discussions and there
will be so many video based discussions
on your YouTube channel so you can just
have a glance if you want even have live
interactions okay we are planning so
much this year so I'll be explaining how
this live interactions will go on you
will get a bird of PP books smart cards
or like work cards you have Android app
you have iOS app you have smart
examination protocol that's what the
unique property of MDS conference please
make a note all time this phone is live
and available for your work so that is
double nine eight nine four two seven
nine seven one and we'll conquer
so going further of course the track
record is very important for any point
likely talking is very easy ok we go
with our tagline is talk less and do
more but now I feel like this is the
right time to talk more rather than
talking less and doing more so I want to
show my track record my team track
record of MDS conquer okay if you have
analyzed that or India I mean like the
Andhra and Telangana toppers of 2017 and
18 probably expecting the same in 2019
in your senior batch MBAs conquer is the
best occupying all first frankerz in the
best places and if you analyze the 2018
result there are more than seven conquer
students in the top list of Telangana
and there are more than nine eight to
nine students in the top 15 list of
Andhra and more than 50 60 % is 60 to
65% azor the counselling seats through
the state counseling off the lung Ghana
were conquer students and more than 55
to 58 percentage of counseling states
seats through the counseling of andhra
are from and is conquer itself so if you
go want to go in detail into the track
record 2015 our strength is 238 out of
which 92 are doing MDS and out of which
are from 22 are from giasses 436 this
our strength is in the second year we
have 198 people doing MDS and 48 judases
and 2017 we have 760 strength we have
two hundred two hundred and fifty eight
people doing MDS and out of which 52 are
CDC's and probably this year a conquer
army is around one zero three eight
going for the neat 2018 December and
probably we are expecting a bulk number
of CDC's this year because the mode of
preparation the strategy was to Haifa
this year and your seniors are really
working like them to make things
possible so we have started our offline
center the first batch is on the way to
the race
and I want to share a few important
things about my offline center so this
is what the offline classes are this is
what the classroom is this is how the
mode of preparation is and I'm just
talking about the live interactions this
year we have taken a greater move to
have many live interactions we we
planned live interaction almost all the
college's through that along one and
languor and probably from this batch
that is the fifth batch of MDS conquer
mean your batch we are planning live
interactions one day every two to three
months every two to three months you are
going to have a live interaction in your
college itself if your college is going
to permit I have access to many colleges
in Andhra and Telangana but probably we
will be taking permission from all the
colleges if the college people are not
permitting due to any sort of personal
issues will we'll find out a solution
for that okay we'll be coming to the
respective places and we'll be meeting
them beers conquer students outside the
chorus and probably 80 percentage of the
colleges they are ready to give the way
for Gateway for us to spend much of your
time these are the few peaks that are
taken in the last year where there were
lots of these and interactions around
the colleges of Andhra and tellenson and
we are probably having thinking of to
extend MDS punker apart from this Telugu
speaking States probably will have few
interactions in Chennai few interactions
we are planning to be we take may takes
place in Mumbai at Pune if if the people
are very interested and online students
first other State people online students
whether they may be from Karnataka Theo
and Russians because we used to have
students from top to bottom of India we
used to have a regular YouTube live
interaction
okay I'll be sitting inside the in front
of you in the YouTube so you can ask me
the questions so I'll be answering them
helping you out I'll be available on for
I'll be available on what's up so we
team are ready to work and give our best
for you people all the time so this is
what the rough ideology of what the
ambience conquer is going to do so
before taking a piss
we team we have guts to tell that you
come for the truth of MDS conquer you
come for the free demo of MDS conquer
enjoy the free demo for 10 to 15 days
then after you can decide whether you
want to be a part of this or not for
sure we have more than 90 percentage of
conversion rate means people who are a
part of our demo out of 190 people will
join MDS conquer because the mode of
teaching the mode of motivation the mode
of positiveness and the mode of friendly
comfortability is best with MDS conquer
I can trust myself and my team and
definitely the team and myself are going
to give you the best in this dream 2020
batch so about the offline platform ok I
don't want to talk much about the
offline strategies offline strategies
are totally different because I revealed
out only 50 percentage of my online
strategies maybe probably maybe to
attract the individuals or attract the
papers ok so if I reveal out all the
strategies what we as a team or forming
in the simple youtube video may be the
competitors may copy/paste our core work
so I don't want this to happen so I have
shared just few of my ideas that may
influence you but majority of things
will grow inside the group and probably
I don't want to talk much about my
offline centre Hyderabad it's in
kukatpalli little sorry it's in
kukatpalli housing board and we are
probably will be planning to I mean like
the Vijayawada Center is on the way a
probability may take 30 to 40 or days
for the Vijaywada Center to get opened
and available for you both the study
room and everything because offline we
have lots of elements us so I request
each and every one once once you need to
visit this offline have an interaction
with the mentors there so that you can
have a better idea whether it is an
online student or an offline student I
like whenever you visit Hyderabad you
can come to the offline Center we Hou
will have a decent talk and that's all
ok offline strategies will be discussed
in offline you can attend the demos of
offline two or three sessions you can
if you like you can be a part of the
same goes with the online only if you
like then you can be a part of MDS
conquer okay we don't force anyone to be
a part of this we go with a decent
friendly work to make a difference in
our lives
right so that's what I don't want to go
with any sort of motivation right now
but this video is mainly is all about
like what we will do what you have to do
what I have to do all this X Y Zed stuff
thank you all the best have a great day
MDS conquer is going to create a greater
impact in your professional life bye
