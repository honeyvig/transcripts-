did you know an estimated 2.5
quintillion bytes of data is generated
on an everyday basis and forecast
predicts that the numbers will surely
increase by almost 10 times by 2030.
data has always been an essential asset
to the growth of any organization and
since we are living and working in a
data-driven world it is important to
organize and store data properly and
most importantly in an efficient manner
for decades traditional relational
databases have been the backbone of data
storage MySQL post to SQL and Microsoft
SQL Server have been the leading
database Technologies to store and
manipulate data and there's no sign of
them disappearing anytime soon
traditional databases are still an
extremely efficient way to store and
access data however a new type of
database known as nosql is gaining huge
popularity nosql database is an approach
that works towards managing data as well
as database design which may come in
handy to process huge sets of
distributed data to address Big Data
performance and scalability issues and
one such popular database is mongodb
well you heard it right mongodb is an
open source documented oriented database
to handle large-scale web applications
so what could be better than staying
ahead of the curve and getting trained
in mongodb well subscribing to our
Channel simply learn of course since we
published Tech related content every day
to help you master various emerging
Technologies and programming languages
also make sure to hit that Bell icon to
never miss an update from us today's
video will be a full course on mongodb
for 2023. starting from the basics to
the advanced level topics we will start
up this video with a quick introduction
to nosql databases by understanding the
fundamentals of mongodb database to
become an expert in mongodb firstly you
must understand and master the concepts
of schema design and data modeling
following the Mastery of data modeling
the next step is to master how to query
current operations and perform
projection on documents furthermore it
is important to understand the
aggregation framework and and how or
when to use indexing with this
foundation in place one can progress to
intermediate level topics such as
monitoring backup and restore Security
Options as well as understanding the
various storage engines that mongodb
supports and how to use mongodb with big
data all of this information should
provide a solid foundation for moving on
to Concepts like mapreduce grid fs and
scaling aspects such as replication and
sharding with the goal of providing
effective fault tolerance and high
availability so without any further Ado
let's get started
session and finishing what is mongodb
why is it used and what is its
significance in today's world I hope my
audio is fine and the screen is clearly
visible if you guys are facing any issue
do let us know in the comment section
and our team will try to fix it as soon
as possible all right now in the world
of databases the most common and well
popular databases are rdbms which is
relational database Management Systems
now what if you want to develop an
application which deals with a large
volumes of data then we need to choose
one such database which always provides
a high performance data storage
solutions so that we can achieve the
performance in the solution in the terms
of data store and the retrieval with
accuracy speed and reliability now if
you categorize the database Solutions
then there are many two types of
database categories that are available
that is the first one is rdbms like
MySQL SQL Server Oracle Etc and another
type is no SQL databases like mongodb
Cosmo DB Cassandra Hadoop Etc more on
that soon firstly let us discuss the
agenda for today's session we'll start
the tutorial with a quick introduction
to nosql and then we'll discuss what
exactly is what is mongodb and then
we'll go through the history of mongodb
which is when it when and how it came
into existence and after that we'll
understand why we use mongodb up next
we'll discuss some key Salient features
of mongodb up next we will discuss how
exactly mongodb works and then we'll go
through some different applications of
mongodb in real life and then we'll see
which companies are using mongodb in
current days and finally we'll
understand when to use and when not to
use the mongodb
now before we understand what is mongodb
isn't it is important to learn what is
nosql now under the vast roof of Big
Data there lies a number of databases
which are used to store these massive
amounts of data that is generated
worldwide now one among them which is
attracting a huge number of interest is
the nosql database the not only SQL or
nosql database which is often referred
as with these two terms is an approach
that works towards managing data as well
as the database design which may come in
handy for huge sets of distributed data
it consists of number of Technologies
and architectures that seek a solution
to the Big Data performance issues and
scalability that cannot be addressed by
the relational databases now this
database is used when companies and
Enterprises develop a need to access and
analyze large amounts of unstructured
data or the data stored in multiple
virtual servers in the cloud now there
is no specific definition for what nosql
is but it is a common set of observation
where you can describe that it is not a
relational model that is unlike the
traditional relational databases which
store data in the form of tables which
comprises of rows and columns no SQL
database doesn't store in that way now
in nosql databases also we have a
various types of databases now the first
one is key value database that is it is
a simplest type of nosql database and
every data element in the database is
stored as a key value pair consisting of
an attribute name or key and a value so
in a sense a key value stored is like a
relational database with only two
columns the key or attribute name such
as anything like state ID or name and
the values such as let's say a country
name India so that is one of a nosql
database and next we have column based
or column oriented databases now while a
relational database stores data in rows
and reads data row by row a column store
is organized as a set of columns this
means that when you want to run
analytics on a small number of columns
you can read those columns directly
without consuming memory with The
Unwanted data
and of course we have the document type
of database the concept that is focused
on in document databases the documents
that are stored and received from the
database store can be like a Json or a
Json or an XML format now these
documents are usually similar to each
other and are in a hierarchical free
data structure that are self-describing
and consists of scalar values Maps
Collections and Etc
and finally we do have graph databases
guys now a graph database focuses on the
relationship between data elements now
each data element is stored as a node
and the connections between elements are
called links or relationships in a graph
database connections of first class
elements of the database taught directly
now in relational databases link links
are implied using data to express the
relationship now these were some of the
mainly used nosql database guys but in
this tutorial we'll be only focusing on
the document database and which is one
of the most commonly used no SQL
databases out there and the best example
is mongodb and apart from mongodb we do
have other document databases like couch
base nosql database as well now that
we've understood what is a nosql
databases Let Us Now quickly understand
what is mongodb
mongodb is an open source document
oriented or a non-relational database
now it is different than traditional
relational databases like post to SQL
MySQL or SQL Server because it stores
the data in json-like documents instead
of tables and it is primarily is used to
store large volumes of data in the form
of documents
now traditional relational databases
stored data using tables and rows right
mongodb on the other hand is a
non-relational database which has
collections instead of tables now
documents are stored inside the
collections in where rows are
stored in tables in traditional
relational databases now with mongodb
the biggest Advantage is the structure
and scheme of your data is flexible and
not enforced by a predefined table
definition unlike relational databases
where you have to specify the schema
that is the structure of the table the
attributes and the values in it now
documents can vary greatly in size and
shape within the same collection whereas
tables are more rigidly defined in a
relational database so when you are
using mongodb it represents hierarchy
relationship in a single record instead
of joining multiple tables so that is
the main difference between a relational
database and a non-relational database
and mongodb being a nosql database
follows the a document data model which
is a collection of complex documents
which arbitrary nested data formats and
varying records formats now because
mongodb does not store data in a
structured table format you cannot query
it using SQL instead mongodb uses a more
flexible and a dynamic query language
called specific carries which is
based on JavaScript which we'll be
discussing in a certain way
all right I hope you understood what is
mongodb let us now go to the history of
mongodb guys now it is also important
that when and how mongodbs came into
existence even though we have several
relational databases in the market
now mongodb was first introduced in 2007
tangent software company began
developing mongodb in 2007 as a
component of a planned platform as a
service product so from 2000 to 7 to
2008 it was developed and it was working
as a platform as a service product
now in 2009 the company shifted to an
open source development model with the
company offering commercial support and
other services so from 2009 since it
became an open source the users can
directly download it from the internet
in 2013 tangent changed its name to
mongodb Inc and it is working under the
same Banner on October 20 2017 mongodb
became a publicly listed traded company
on NASDAQ as amdb with an IPO price of
24 dollars per share now mongodb is a
global company with U.S headquarters in
New York City and international
headquarters in Dublin and has more than
110 million download and regular users
in the current times and the latest
version of it was released in 2022 which
is 6.0
let us now understand why mongodb is
used guys now since mongodb is a nosql
database we need to understand when and
why we need to use it in real life as
well now since a normal circumstances
mongodb always preferred by the
developers when our main concern is to
deal with larger huge volumes of data
with a high performance so if you want
to insert thousands of thousands of
Records in a second then mongodb is the
best choice for that now also one of the
main reason is to overcome the
limitation of relational databases or
like the structured query language guys
where the language is only used for
certain
databases offer limited records right so
in order to overcome that we use mongodb
since it is a robust and highly scalable
and it is also powerful way of storing
data in comparison to traditional
databases
now it is also highly flexible which
allows you to store and work on
different data types in one document
whereas in relational database you store
data in tables and you have to maintain
a proper schema for that so you need to
join multiple tables if you want to
retrieve certain amounts of data and
mongodb also provides a lot of security
and it is also considered as a powerful
query language as well
now as discussed earlier mongodb allows
the user with flexible schema that means
it allows you to meet the ever-changing
conditions characteristics of Big Data
applications if you are working on
massive amounts of data on a regular
basis and also it gives you high
performance with its incredible features
like on-demand scaling real-time
resources which will guarantee the user
high performance of the applications let
us now discuss some of the key features
of mongodb now the first one is
aggregation now you might have heard
about aggregation in SQL as well now
data records are processed by
aggregation which is grouping of data
which then produces the competed results
or into a single result now in simple
words aggregation operations group
values from multiple documents in
mongodb database together and can
perform a variety of operations on the
grouped data to return a single result I
said earlier it is similar to that of
SQL Group by Clause where we use
aggregation functions like average sum
minimum Max I and others
next we have the grid FS now grid FS is
a specification for storing and
retrieving files that exceed the base on
document size limit of 16 MB now instead
of storing a file in a single document
grid FS divides a file into parts or
which is called as chunks and stores
each of those chunks as a separate
document Now by default grid FS limits
trans size to 255 KV now it uses two
collections to store files so it is also
another important feature of mongodb now
next we have sharding now in mongodb uh
it uses sharding and replication which
are another key factors sharding allows
partitioning of data across multiple
servers using the shared key and the
technique of synchronizing all these
organized data across many servers to
offer redundancy is known as replication
now next we have document oriented as we
all know that mongodb is a document
oriented type of a database there are
different documents to store different
types of data and each document has a
unique system generated key the
application I think we have already
discussed and also our mongodb is a
schema-less database that is it stores
data in collections with no enforced
schema so in other words incoming data
can have a predefined structure and it
can alert to it however different
documents in the same collection can
have different structures if required
indexing is also another key feature of
mongodb which is one of the most
important options to improve the search
query performance now as a result we
should index the fields that fit our
search criteria like without indexing
mongodb it has to scan every document of
the collection to get the required
result that matches the query statement
right so in order to eliminate that we
need to provide indexing for a faster
query retrieval
next we have ADD our queries now in most
cases while designing a database schema
we don't know what queries we'll run
ahead of time right so when we design
our database we may not be knowing uh
the query types of the data that we
process into our database so ad hoc
query is the query not known while
structuring the data or you can say that
ADA queries are short-lived uh queries
whose value depends on variables so
mongodb supports these types of queries
and can buy also updated in real time
and finally high performance performance
means writing speed performance of
mongodb is far greater than any other
relational database like MySQL those
were some of the key features of mongodb
so let us now understand how exactly
mongodb Works guys mongodb stores data
objects in collections and documents
instead of the traditional tables and
rows which is used in our relational
databases now collections comprise sets
of documents which are equivalent to
tables and relational database now
documents consist of a key value pair
which are basic unit of data in mongodb
now the structure of a document can be
changed by simply adding a new fields or
deleting existing ones now documents can
define a primary key as a unique
identifier and values can be of variety
of data types including the other
documents and the array of documents so
it is basically uh works on a JavaScript
query which is Json
and it is for further classified into
base one which is a binary encoded
object notation so if you look at the
picture in this we have basically a host
which uh
ultimately has a server which stores the
data and further we have databases
wherein we have different Collections
and in collections we have documents so
the data is stored in this documents
which is further presented into the
collections and are saved into databases
so this is roughly how exactly mongodb
works let us now discuss some
applications of mongodb in real life as
well guys now one of the main
application is iot or Internet of things
which is one of the most appreciated
technology Innovations in the world
today connecting billions of devices
globally now with iot companies improved
productivity redefine their models and
leverage operational efficiency so
mongodb helps to maximize this full
potential of iot devices its integent
data platform which speeds up the
operation and delivery of iot devices it
is also extensively used in mobile
applications because with the data that
is being generated like for example in
social media in Internet we need mongodb
to handle such amounts of our data right
so it is also used in real time analysis
now with rdbms databases analytics and
transactional databases were usually
separate and data from the transactional
database would have to be moved to
analytics and one environment which
requires an immense daily data load now
with nosql databases like mongodb
companies can now analyze data in real
time while saving costs for example if
you take stock market we have a tons or
trillions amounts of data has been
generated every day so again in sports
as well which is a real-time data
analysis to get the Insight we need the
data in a quick and faster manner so in
that case we can use mongodb as well
mongodb is also perfect for catalog
management content management as well as
product data management guys it enables
product data or the content related
information to be managed and processed
in a single Central system this allows
for detailed cost analysis increase
productivity giving you insights and
improve collaboration with the companies
as well so one of the best example if I
take is the other card guys it is a real
world mongodb use case where other is a
India's unique identification project
and world's most extensive biometric
database system now we know that it was
I think it was launched into early 2010s
and it has collected demographic and
biometric information of over 1.5
billion people in India so other mostly
relies on mongodb among other databases
like hbase MySQL Hadoop which basically
runs on massive amounts of data which
process huge amount of data in a real
time
so mongodb was one of the database
systems for purchase to power the search
strategy of other card all right let us
now discuss some of the companies which
are using mongodb in real life uh guys
so companies like Google Facebook Bosch
eBay are some of the companies which
have extensively used mongodb nowadays
and apart from that we have other
companies like you know Toyota Cisco
Adobe sa AstraZeneca Verizon and other
service and product based companies use
mongodb on a regular basis now apart
from this we have Shutterfly we have
MetLife we even have Forbes which use
mongodb on a regular basis
and that brings us to the end of today's
session guys now before we uh wrap up
the session it is also important that
you need to understand when you should
be using mongodb and when you shouldn't
now although mongodb is a great database
out there there are times you shouldn't
and you should use in certain uh
circumstances now mongodb works
extensively well with unstructured data
so it's great for uh big data analytic
systems so if you're working on huge
chunks of data which needs in a
real-time processing immediately then
you can use mongodb mongodb is also used
for cloud computing like Microsoft Azure
AWS which is an ideal cloud computing
platform uh for mongodb because
cloud-based storage needs to easily
distribute data across multiple servers
and which basically suits mongodbs
nature
now if you do not have any database
administrator in that case you you might
as well use mongodb as well now wherein
you have lots of unstructured data to
process and which has no storable data
type limits so in that case you can use
mongodb and finally if you have schema
issues that is if you have an unstable
or undefined schema you can use mongodb
which is not with the case of
traditional database which requires a
predefined schema before you start
working on the database as you all know
we are living in the era of Big Data
where massive volumes of data are
generated per second worldwide so
handling and storing these huge chunks
of data is pivotal are Paramount for all
the companies around the world
traditionally relational databases were
used to store this data prior to when
the internet came into existence now in
the early 1990s the internet gained
extreme popularity and the relational
databases could not keep up with flow of
information and data demanded by the
users as well as the large variety of
data types that occurred from this
Evolution this led to the development of
non-relational databases often referred
to as no SQL the not only SQL or
commonly known as nosql databases is an
approach to data management and database
design that may be useful for large sets
of distributed data and unstructured
data it basically consists of collection
of Technologies and architecture that
seek to address Big Data performance and
scalability issues that relational
databases cannot address so this
database is used when businesses and
Enterprises require access to an
analysis of large amounts of
unstructured data now these unstructured
data can be of any type it can be a text
file it can be an image or video and
others that are stored across multiple
servers so it is important that we
understand how this nosql databases work
so in today's session we'll be going
through all the concepts that are needed
to understand what no SQL databases are
and how it they exactly work so without
any further delay let us jump straight
into today's topic
firstly let us go to the agenda for
today's session we'll start the tutorial
by understanding what is SQL and then
we'll look at why we use SQL and after
that we'll understand what is nosql
database and then we'll understand why
we use nosql up next we'll understand
how to use nosql and how exactly it
works and then we'll look at some
different types of nosql databases and
after that we'll have a detailed
comparison between SQL and osql database
and finally we'll conclude the session
by understanding some advantages and
disadvantages of using nosql and will
also look when to use SQL as well as
nosql so without any further delay let's
dive straight into today's topic on SQL
versus nosql firstly let us understand
what is SQL SQL as it stand is defined
as structure query language is basically
a standardized programming language that
is used to manage databases and it
performs various operations on data in
them initially created in 1970s SQL is
widely used by many companies and
Technologies nowadays
skill is used for modifying database
tables and index structures it is also
used in adding updating and deleting
rows of data it is also used to retrieve
subsets of information from within the
database management system
now SQL is used to perform various
actions such as to insert data to update
data modify and delete the data in the
database as well
now when we talk about SQL it is
important that we talk about relational
database systems as well a relational
database system or RDM rdbms is a
database system that stores and fetches
data in the form of table that is in the
form of rows and columns tables are used
to store data and relational databases
about related objects each column
contains attributes of data whereas each
row holds a record of unique data known
as a key which helps in making
relationship between different data
points that is present in different
table which makes us easy to understand
now these relational databases or rdbms
are managed using SQL language
to perform various operations therefore
SQL codes are used to retrieve
information from these relational
databases by doing various interactive
operations like using join create
truncate delete alter and Etc
let us now look at some popular SQL
databases some popular SQL databases
that are available are MySQL Oracle
database Microsoft SQL
server sqlite and postgresql
now that we have understood what is SQL
let us now understand what is non SQL
that is no SQL sorry no SQL database is
a non-relational database management
system that does not require a fixed
schema that is the data is stored is not
stored in the form of tables in nosql
databases
basically it avoids any uh joining or
creating or scaling the databases in SQL
the major purpose of using a nosql
database is for distributed data storage
which is having high volumes of data
storage needs noise scale is used for
big data and real-time web applications
like for example companies like Amazon
Facebook Google correct terabytes of
users data and every single day
so basically nosql database stands for
not only SQL or not SQL and it is
introduced in the year 1998 by Karl
Strauss now traditional rdbms uses SQL
syntax to store and retrieve data for
further insights now instead our nosql
database system encompasses a wide range
of database technologies that can store
structured semi-structured as well as
unstructured data
let us now understand why we use nosql
we use
hierarchical storage structure instead
of a table like structure
that means before relational databases
companies used a hierarchical database
system which with a tree-like structure
for database tables now these early
database Management Systems enable users
to organize large quantities of data
however they were complex often required
a particular application and in a
limited way which they could uncover the
data that is stored now these
limitations eventually led to the
development of relational database that
is the data that is stored in tables so
a skill provided an interface to
interact with relational data and
allowing the analyst to connect Tables
by merging on common fields But as time
passed the demand for faster and more
desperate usage of larger data sets
became increasingly more important for
emerging Technologies for e-commerce and
other big change for that no SQL has
become the alternative for everyone
now another reason is it is now we have
constant addition of new features and
functions in the nosql database right
so that means like we know that
technology is being rapidly evolved and
huge enormous amounts of data has been
released on a daily basis and it's
important that we store this data and
access in a quick way now noise the best
database to use for large amounts of
data or for Ever Ever Changing data sets
it is also best use when you have to uh
have flexible data model or need that
don't fit into a relational model
and finally when if if you want that
there is no relationship between any
stored data and the field is not
important then you can use nosql as well
let us now look at some popular noise
scale databases some popular nosql
databases are mongodb Apache hedge base
Cassandra redis neo4j and Etc
let us now look at some types of nosql
databases that are present firstly we
have document oriented the document
database typically stores
self-describing Json XML and bson
documents they are similar to key value
stores but in this case a value is a
single document that stores all the data
to related to a specific key popular
fields in the document can be indexed to
provide faster retrieval without knowing
the key as well each document can have
same or different data structure
mongodb couchdb cloudant are some
examples of document based uh nosql
database next we have key value pair
database the data in this is stored like
a key value pairs key value pair data
stored in database in the form of a hash
table each key is unique in this case
the value stored may be an integer
string a binary object a Json object Etc
the key Value Store based database is
simplest database among all the data
databases in nosql database
redis coherents are examples of some key
Value Store databases
next we have column based or column
store database in nosql which is in this
the data stored in grouped columns
instead of rows every column values are
stored separately it delivers high
performance on aggregate functions like
count sum Max minimum group of columns
are data stored in key spaces like
schema and rdbms key spaces contains
group of rowso columns
and hbase bigtable aquilmo are some
examples of column store databases
and finally we have graph oriented or
graph store databases data in this is
represented in the form of a directed
graph it consists of notes and edges
nodes represent an entity and any Edge
represents the relation between the two
nodes node H to be unique social
networks Logistics paytl data used uh
graphical storage database neo4j
infinite graph Orient DB flock DB are
examples of some graph storage database
next let us understand how exactly nosql
database works for that I am going to
take the example of mongodb database now
mongodb is based on the nosql document
store model in which data objects has
stored as separate documents inside a
collection instead of a traditional
column and row of a relational database
now uh mongodb groups data through
Collections and basically a collection
is simply a grouping of documents that
have a same or similar purpose a
collection acts similarly to a table in
a traditional SQL database however it
has a major difference a collection is
not enforced by a strict schema that is
it does not have any fixed schema at all
instead documents in a collection can
have slightly different different
structure from another as needed this
reduces the need to break items in a
document into several different tables
at as it is often done in an SQL
implementation now coming to document a
document is a representation of a single
entity of a data in mongodb database a
collection consists of one one or more
related objects major difference that
exist between mongodb and SQL is that in
that documents are different from rows
row data is flat with one column for
each value in the row however in mongodb
documents can contain embedded
sub-documents providing a much closer
inherent data model for your
applications now if I just have to map
what what are exactly and how it is
different from rdbms a collection in a
mongodb is equivalent to the tables in
rdbms and a document in mongodb is
equivalent to the rows in rdbms and
Fields in mongodb is equivalent to the
columns in rdbms
so this is how a document looks uh in a
mongodb as you can see this is similar
to a row in rdbms but we just have a
field and a value that is taken
separately in instead of a tabular value
and another important thing to note note
here is that a mamodeb supports Dynamic
schema which means one document of a
collection can have a number of fields
while the other document can have less
or same number of fields that is if a
collection can have four Fields while
other document can have only just two
fields which is basically not possible
in a relational database which does not
exist as it it does not support because
it needs a particular and a fixed schema
in that
let us now understand some differences
between the SQL and nosql firstly SQL is
a relational database and nosql is a
non-relational database that means SQL
databases are in the form of tables that
can contain rows and columns and they
have fixed logical schema design all the
data in SQL is arranged in tabular
format and it is well suited for complex
queries and on the other hand nosql
databases is a non-relational database
that means it does not store data in the
form of tables and contains Collections
and inside every collection there is a
document that contains the data of a
single entry we store this data is
stored in the form of a key value pair
unlike SQL where we store data under the
fixed schema
so as we discussed uh SQL has a fixed
schema design and structure and nosql
has a dynamic schema design and
structure
SQL can handle complex queries whereas
no SQL can handle large volumes of data
now SQL is vertically scalable
now uh SQL databases support vertical
scaling which means it improves the
single server by increasing Ram SSD or
CPU in vertical scaling we are
restricted to a single system and we can
improve it as much as we want till the
Practical limit whereas in nosql
database we can do horizontal scaling
because they support distributed
computing or distributed systems in
horizontal scaling we can add another
node or computer for better performance
and we can add a number of such servers
or nodes as per a requirement so as
discussed we can add as many as nodes as
we want and this is why we prefer nosql
for high scalability because there is no
limit for scaling
and finally it follows acid properties
that is atomicity that means transaction
should be performed at once or it
shouldn't happen at all consistency that
means the state of a database should
remain consistent before and after the
transaction isolation that is one
traction one transaction shouldn't
affect another transaction and it
shouldn't and should be independent and
we lastly durability now successful
transaction should be reflected even if
there is any system failure whereas the
noise skill follows cap property
that is consistency availability and
partial tolerance
let us now discuss some advantages and
disadvantages of using nosql firstly let
us discuss about the advantages
nosql provides high performance and
scalability and it also has a lot of
availability and flexibility it is open
source and it is schema less as well
that is you can directly uh download the
nosql databases from the internet unlike
some commercial databases that are
available in the internet
while on the other hand there are some
disadvantages as well that is it is it
lacks the standardization that means it
does not have a fixed query in order to
retrieve data from the databases which
result in in consistency issues and
since it has all these consistency
issues and does not retrieve data
properly it it has a limited query
capabilities
so that brings us to the end of today's
session on SQL versus no SQL guys so you
might have a doubt that when you need to
use SQL and when we need to use nosql
now SQL is easiest to work with
relational databases that is it is
useful when you want to perform complex
queries using various operations like
join and Etc and if you want to perform
quick data storage and retrieval
operations you can use SQL whereas uh if
you want you can use nosql if you are
designing a distributed systems and if
you want a hierarchical storage
structure instead of a tabular like
structure also nosql gives you the
flexibility to create Dynamic structures
and and can add features as you as you
want
also there is no asset properties during
the creation of any applications while
creating
nosql databases as well so in this way
you can use nosql and SQL as per your
requirement now since it's already
installed on my system uh the
installation process will be different
but you just need to follow the steps
there and finally install it so once
you're done with the installation you
can go to your C drive and here you can
click on program files and you can see
that mongodb is installed and inside of
it you have the server folder and then
you have the 4.4 folder and then you
have the bin folder right so here you
have the application that is your
and the mongod applications both are
executable files now the mongod file or
the application is the daemin process
now this is the background process that
makes sure you retrieve the data from
the database access the data so it does
all the background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just
go to our environment variables
but before that let's just uh
copy this path
right
and here under the user variable section
click on path and say edit
and go ahead and just paste it right
I've already pasted mine so just go
ahead and paste it and click on OK
and
thank you
say okay
right so now you've created the path
successfully now let's head to our
Command Prompt and run the file so
here you can just directly type
since the path has already been created
so just go ahead and say
[Music]
and here you can see that your
server has been generated
and with this you know that you're in
mongodb has been successfully installed
and your server is up and running right
so just for confirmation let's see if
there are any databases and how much
space they've occupied so you can right
now just type show DBS
[Music]
and when you click on it it says admin
config and localhost and all of it is
zero so with that you have successfully
installed mongodb on your system and
it's up and running now in contrast to
structured query language or SQL
databases which is a relational database
model where the structure of the
database and its tables have been
defined mongodb does not have or
required the definition of a database or
a table structure instead we use data
models in order to store the documents
in our database so moving ahead let us
now first discuss the agenda for today's
session we'll start the tutorial by
understanding what is data modeling and
then we'll understand why we use data
modeling after that we'll be going
through how data modeling actually works
in mongodb and next we'll understand
different types of data models in
mongodb up next we'll discuss types of
relationships and data models and then
we'll see some methods to create these
data models and finally we'll understand
when to use these data models as per our
requirement so without any further delay
let's get started with today's topic all
right so what is data modeling in
mongodb now basically data modeling is a
process of taking unstructured data that
is generated from The Real World
scenario and introducing it to the data
server and then structuring it into a
logical data model in our database so it
is basically a process of determining
how data is stored and what connection
exists between various entities in a
relationship now you don't have to
create a schema before inserting data
because nosql is flexible this is so
that mongodb can support a dynamic
database schema that makes it
unnecessary to create your schema in
advance instead you can now store your
information and make changes in
accordance with your data now consider
data modeling in mongodb as a
relationship now there is no particular
relationship just like uh SQL where we
use Now mongodb relationships are the
representations of how multiple
documents are logically connected to
each other in mongodb now since mongodb
is a document database any document
within the same collection is not
mandatory to have same set of fields or
structure you can store different types
in a collections given field and can
even add new Fields update fields and
delete existing Fields as well now for
example consider an online shopping
store where we have like thousands of
customers arriving daily and purchasing
new products from the website now we get
a lot of unstructured data that is the
name of the customer their details and
all which is basically an unstructured
data now in order to convert into a
proper structured data we need to model
them into particular way which this is
where data modeling comes into a picture
where we store the data based upon our
requirement now the main challenge in
data modeling is balancing the
application needs guys now the database
engines performance characteristics and
also the data retrieval patterns
all right let us now move ahead and
understand why we use data modeling
now data model basically helps us to
create a simplified and optimized
logical database that eliminates
redundancy red is a storage requirements
and enables efficient retrieval from the
database now data modeling may appear to
be a complex process wherein you have to
make adjustments to your database unlike
SQL value predefine your schema and
create a new table and then store the
data now while in mongodb data modeling
helps us to analyze and understand what
type of data and how much data has to be
inserted into a database data modeling
is necessary foundational work that
allows data to be stored more easily in
the database and has a positive positive
impact on data analytics as well now let
us understand why exactly we use now
data modeling now data quality is
Paramount for any organization and to
ensure that we need higher data quality
when we are storing unstructured data in
large amounts now the representation of
requirements and the business rules
enables to anticipate what could lead to
a large-scale data corruption before it
occurs so data model enables the
developers in hindsight to Define rules
that monitor the data quality and
ensuring that there is no possibility of
errors
now it is also important to understand
how the data is Flowing within the
database and the characteristics of that
creating data models forces the business
to Define how data is generated and move
across the application
development and maintenance data
modeling exposes errors and
inconsistencies early in the process
making is it making it easier and less
expensive to fix so in order to maintain
a database that is a mongodb database
which is basically a unstructured one it
is important that we try to develop and
maintain it in a regular basis
and finally performance is another
reason why we use data modeling now an
organized database is one that is more
efficiently operated and data modeling
prevents the schema from endless
searching and returns results more
quickly those were some of the reasons
on why we use data modeling guys
all right let us now move and discuss
how data modeling Works in mongodb
now unlike SQL databases where you must
determine and declare a table schema
before inserting data or perform any
operations we need to basically provide
a schema for that now mongodb's
collection by default do not require the
documents to have the same schema now
the documents in a single collection do
not need to have the same set of fields
and the data type of for a field can
differ across documents within a
collection now to change the structure
of the document in a collection such as
adding a new field or removing the
existing field in a document or changing
a field values to a new type or update
the documents to the new structure
now basically the first step is to
basically create and design a schema as
per the requirement and the application
made by the user and then we have to
combine documents now if there is no
scope for multiple documents uh to store
into a single one and ensure that if
there is no other need for a single
document to store in a multiple document
in such way we need to understand what
is our requirement and combine the
documents accordingly so that we can
have performance as well as the
optimization of the database is also
improved now this flexibility
facilitates the mapping of documents to
an entity or an object now each document
can match the data field of a
represented ID entity even if the
document has substantial variation from
other documents in the collection so
this is how basically a data model Works
wherein you have to choose as per the
requirement and understand what type of
documents that are being inserted into
the database
all right let us now understand some
data models that are used in mongodb now
once you've understood the business
requirement and the application on how
it should be as you start modeling your
data you will likely go through various
steps of data analysis now each step
might produce different types of data
models therefore ensuring data models
having the right one can be generally
thought of as being one of the main
aspect of choosing a data model and they
are conceptualized into three categories
based on the level of the detail and the
specificity now that's classified into
three types the first one is conceptual
data model the conceptual data model
explains what the system should contain
with regard to and how it is related
this model is usually built with the
help of the user and the stakeholders it
represents the applications business
logic and is often used as the basis for
one or more following model
next we have the logical data model Now
The Logical data model will describe how
the data will be structured in this
model the relationship between the
entities is established at a high level
you'll also list the attributes for the
entities represented in this model
and finally we have the physical data
model guys the physical data model
represents how the data will be stored
in a specific database now in this case
we have mongodb model where we are using
establishing a primary and a secondary
relationship between the data in a
document that is stored in the database
such as mongodb you will also establish
the data types for each of your fields
that are mentioned this will provide you
with your database schema as well
foreign
mongodb has a flexible schema you need
to uh data model or schema design a good
data model means that you'll establish a
strong foundation for an Ever evolving
data model now mongodb supports multiple
ways to model relationship between the
entities in a data model now the first
one is one to one that is in this type
one value is associated with only one
document that is it will have a single
relationship between the two connected
objects or entities in the database next
we have one too many here one value can
be associated with more than one
document or value at the same time and
finally we have many too many now when
two or more entities within a document
can have multiple relationship that is
basically is many to many relationships
in this type of model multiple documents
can be associated with each other so let
us now quickly understand with an
example now consider the example for one
to one relationship where I have a
student table and contact info table now
for each student ID there is a unique
details or the contact info so it is
basically pointing one value to another
that is student ID which is one to one
relation and similarly we have one too
many relation wherein we have customer
table and Order stable now every
customer has a different ID and a
customer can place multiple orders so it
can generate multiple order IDs so we
have three different IDs like b204 b391
b448 so this is what is one too many
which is basically one entity is being
pointed to three other values I hope you
understood one to one and one to many so
if you understood this let us know in
the comment section below what will be a
good example of many to many
relationship
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of methods to create
the data models now once we are
confirmed with what data model we need
and the relationship that we have chosen
for uh for our documents to store the
data we need a method that is to create
a data model now that is where we have
two different data models that stores
the data in documents that is first one
is embedded data model so in emitted
data model you can embed data in a
single document or structure in mongodb
it is also referred to as the normalized
data model it leverages the full
potential of mongodbs Rich document and
it uses a one to one or one-to-many
relationship guys
next we have the reference data model or
in other words it is known as normalized
data model now they are used to build
one too many as well as many too many
relationship models now while working
with the embedded document models there
will be times when you have to repeat
the data this is where reference data
model comes into picture which basically
tackles their data redundancy
so I know it is bit of confusing so
let's just understand this with an
example here now if you consider the
embedded
model if you look at a document which I
have taken here which is the details of
a student named Rohan where we have a
collection uh that is containing a
document has Rohan in this document we
have embedded a document here that is
contact details and his grade
so embedding uh data model stores
relevant details in the same documents
or the same database record this way you
can minimize queries and update required
to perform common database operation on
the other hand we have a reference data
model or the normalized data model
so if you look at to the reference model
example here we have basically split a
single document into three documents and
since contact details and grade have the
ID from the document that is of rohans
you can call them whenever needed now
normalized data model splits the data
into multiple collections by using
references between the newer collections
you can update or change a single
document which will update other
collections automatically this is an
efficient way of updating data and is
mostly used when your data goes through
frequent changes that is if you're
working on a data that has to be
leveraged or changed on a daily basis
you can consider reference model
that is which is basically one of the
biggest advantages of using normalized
data where you have to model large data
sets that follow a certain hierarchy and
you have to where you have to represent
multiple many-to-many relationships so
that is where we use a embedded model
and reference model all right as we know
mongodb is a nosql database program that
controls document oriented data instead
of a relational data made irrational
data model which comprises of rows and
columns now the speed of mongodb is one
of its characteristics as it handles a
huge chunks of unstructured data so in
order to perform a certain operation
mongodb may use operators to carry out
particular tasks in order to return
queries more quickly and efficiently so
in today's session we'll be taking you
through all about the mongodb operators
what are the the different types of
mongodb operators that I use its
functions with the help of some examples
so without any further Ado let's get
started so what is mongodb operators
operators are basically special symbols
or keywords that tell a compiler what
mathematical or logical operations to
perform the operator improves mongodb
functionality by enabling the developers
and programmers to construct
sophisticated queries to communicate
with data sets that are appropriate for
their application and perform certain
complex tasks to retrieve the data now
in general we use the find command or
method to fetch the data from
collections using the query operator
also we need to use the prefix which is
the dollar sign before the query
operator so let us just quickly
understand the syntax of the operators
in mongodb the syntax is followed as DB
dot name of collection dot find and
within the parenthesis
we have to mention the field name and
mention the semicolon and then we have
to mention the dollar symbol with the
help of the operator that we want to use
mention the value and finally we use the
pretty uh method so let us just quickly
go through all this uh terminology so
that will have a better idea now the
name of the collection is basically
according to the query operator we used
in our query this parameter is defined
as the collection name from which
documents have been retrieved next we
have the find method now data can be
retrieved from collections using this
technique we can also retrieve
particular documents from mongodb by
using the find method with a query
operator next we have this field name
according the query parameter we used in
our query this parameter is defined as
the name of the field from which we are
retrieving data that is what we are
trying to uh retrieve data from our
collection is basically the field name
next we have the query operator name
which must be used to retrieve the
documents from the collection in
accordance with the query operations
next we have to mention the value the
value is nothing more than the field
value that we used with a query operator
to conduct logical or any mathematical
operations and so on and finally we have
an option well uh tag which is pretty
now since mongodb output is generally is
in an unstructured format so we can
display our output using this technique
in a structure format and this is also
optional guys so if there is a
requirement to show the data in a proper
structure where you can use the pretty
uh statement so that was all about
mongodb operators guys so let us just
move ahead so let us now understand the
different types of operators in mongodb
now just like any operators in other
programming languages mongodb operators
are used to perform specific relational
mathematical or logical operations and
produce this final result operators in
mongodb are you know broadly classified
into three types the first one is query
and projection operator next we have
update operator and then finally we have
aggregation pipeline operator
now in mongodb the default for queries
is to return all the fields in the
matching documents so basically a query
and a projection operator is used to
perform certain calculation wherein a
projection query is used to specify or
restrict the data result returned in
query result Now by specifying a
projection query you can specify the
fields you want to return or exclude now
similarly we have other query operators
which we'll be discussing in a while
which are used to perform certain a
complex calculation on the data that you
are retrieving from the documents next
we have the update operator which
basically updates the value of all the
fields of the documents which is
matching the specified condition and
finally we have the aggregation pipeline
so it basically provides a competent
results as a result of processing the
data requires an document so it is
similar to that of aggregate functions
in SQL wherein it you know Aggregates
all the values within a document and
perform certain aggregation uh operation
like you know some Maximum minimum and
so on so these are some of the main uh
different types of operators in mongodb
so let us now just uh get into detail
and how that further classified into
various types now query and projection
operator further classified into various
other types such as comparison operator
logical operator array operator element
Operator bitwise Operator evaluation
operator and finally we have geospatial
operator now it is time taking to get
into all of this stuff and explain each
and every operator guys so let us just
focus on the main operators that are
frequently used in mongodb
so firstly let us discuss about the
comparison operator guys now the
comparison operators are basically used
to compare to expressions and retrieve
data from the documents that is the
documents that are that we have stored
uh that is the all the data from the
collections which are basically the
group of collections is basically a
document in mongodb that is stored in
the mongodb database now we have several
such comparison operators in mongodb now
as explained earlier we have to use the
dollar sign with the help of operator
that we have been uh mentioning so
basically The Operators are take the
dollar sign and then we have to mention
the operator that we have taken so let
us just discuss some of the operators
here the first one is EQ which is
basically the equal operator which
matches values that are equal to the
value specified in the query next we
have dollar any which has a full form of
not equal to which is opposite of equal
and matches all the values that are not
equal to the value specified in the
query next we have GT and GT which is
basically greater than and greater than
equals to uh this operator basically
matches the value that are greater than
the value specified in the query or that
are even greater than or equal to the
various value specified in the query
next we have the LT or LTE that is less
than or less than equals to again as the
uh the word course it is similar again
it matches the values that are less than
the value specified in the query or it
matches with the less than or equal
values specified in the query in the
document and finally we have the in and
nin which basically matches any of the
value that is existing or not existing
in an array specified in the query I
know it is a bit of confusing so let us
just uh understand this with an example
here so consider this example on your
right hand side where you can see this
image which is basically a format of a
document that is stored in a mongodb
database guys so let us say I have uh
you know a collection named orders of
let's say a stationary item database now
I have further different three different
documents that are present in
uh this collection so basically a group
of documents is basically a collection
in a mongodb database so I hope you've
understood uh what is a collection
document and what is a database so if
you want to know more about it we have a
dedicated video on what is mongodb where
we've uh explained clearly on all these
terms and how it exactly Works make sure
you check that out uh which will be
quite helpful and I would highly
recommend so as you can see we have
basically three documents here we have a
ID of three different uh people who have
purchased certain products from a
stationary and have different IDs so we
have three customers here Rahul prenup
and kirti now if I say if I want to
perform comparison operation for this uh
let us just understand how equal and not
equal operation performs so basically uh
I'm taking an example here which says
dp.orders DOT fine where payment mode is
equals to card so basically uh the
compiler finds all the documents that is
present in this college action where the
payment mode is made through card which
instead of cache so basically we have
here uh the details of two customers who
have used their payment models card
which is customer Rahul and customer
kirti so in this way it will return
these two uh following documents and
similarly we have any which is not equal
to and I'm taking another example which
is DB dot orders fine order total is not
equal to 600. now as you can see in the
image we have the third document of
customer kirti whose order total is 600
right so it basically evaluates this and
Returns the result which has an order
total which is not equals to 600 that is
basically the first two documents that
is it will retrieve the data from this
document of the first uh you know two
documents which is of customer Rahul and
customer whose order total is basically
2450 and 5800 respectively so that is
basically what is a comparison operator
using EQ and any which is equal to or
not equals to All Right Moving ahead let
us now discuss what is GT and GTA which
basically derived as greater than and
greater than equals to again let us
consider the same uh you know collection
same example that we have taken earlier
now the first query is basically a first
GT that is DP Dodge order find order
total is greater than three thousand all
right so we are basically performing a
search query wherein we want only uh
those documents whose order total is
greater than three thousand now if you
look at the image we have only uh I
guess one document which is of customer
pranav whose order total is 5800 which
is more than 3000 and similarly we have
for greater than equals to which is DB
dot orders fine order total GTE uh 2450.
so basically we should retrieve the
document whose order total is more than
250. again we have two documents here
right now we have a document of customer
Rahul and the customer pranav whose
order total is 2450 which is equals to
2450 for that we have mentioned in our
query so basically uh the details of the
documents of customer Rahul and customer
pranav whose order total is greater than
or equals to 24 500. all right moving
ahead let us now understand what is LT
and LP which is a negation or complete
opposite is greater than greater uh than
equals to now in less than we have taken
an example which is again order total
Which is less than 2000 uh so I guess we
have only one record again here of
customer
whose order total is 600 and similarly
less than or equals to 500 now I guess
we have only one document again of kirti
which is order total is 600. oh I'm
sorry are less than or equals to 500
right so we don't have any uh you know
document of the customers Which is less
than or equal to 500 guys sorry are just
a pardon me for my mistake item check so
we don't have any customers whose order
total is less than or equals to 500 so
it will basically uh you know retrieve a
null value
so that were some examples of comparison
Operator Let us move ahead with logical
operators now so basically logical
operators return data based on the
expression that evaluate the following
condition to either be true or false now
in general we have four different types
of logical operators in mongodb which is
and or not and not which is again
similar uh with any other programming
languages where we use a logical
operator and similar to that of SQL as
well now the basically the and operator
returns all the documents that match the
condition of both the expression
specified and or operator returns all
documents that match the condition of
either expression specified next we have
the nor operator which returns all
documents that do not match the
condition of either expression this is
basically an opposite of or operator and
finally we have the not operator which
basically returns documents that does
not match with the query expression in a
document so again let's just understand
with an example by considering the same
example which is the order collection
now for Forex first example I am taking
and operator which says DB dot orders
fine and address city is either daily or
payment mode is cash now if I look into
the uh collection here I have only one
such document where City address city is
Delhi and payment mode is cash that is
the details of customer pranav so it
will retrieve only the document of
pranav here next if I consider the r
operator which is DB dot orders fine or
CT Jaipur or order total is less than or
equals 200 so we have Jaipur uh City
whose uh I think it's of customer uh
Jaipur yeah it's of customer Rahul so it
will retrieve that one and it will also
retrieve those documents whose order
total is less than or equals two
thousand now we have only one document
of kirti whose order total is 600 which
is again less than or equals to 100 so
basically the first document and the
third document will be retrieved in our
query in a final resultant set and
finally we have the nor operator which
says the city is either is not either
daily or payment mode is cache now other
than City Delhi and the payment mode
cache that is we have a pranav whose
payment mode is cash and also belongs to
Siri so basically it will remove the
document of this person customer uh
printer and it will fetch the first and
third documents that is uh the I the
customer rahul's and the customer kirti
so those were some of the uh logical
operator examples we have used I hope
you've understood
so moving ahead let us now discuss some
element operators guys the element query
operators are basically used to locate
document I know based uh on the fields
of the document
now what that I mean is so basically
every document has a field right now for
example let's say in the previous
example I've taken ID customer name
order total and so on and so which is
basically a field I know these field
have further values or elements to its
name right so the element operator
basically uh finds all the documents
based on the fields of the document that
you are trying to search for now we have
basically two uh element operator which
is exists and types exist operator
basically returns documents that have a
specific field now if I let let us take
an example let's say I have an uh you
know collection employees and I want to
find the employee age as a field I want
to find if there is a field called
employees and his age is greater than or
equals to 35 so I have taken this
example which is DB dot employees fine
employee age exists true gt35 so if
there is any field in our collection of
employees and this greater than 25 or
greater than 35 it will retrieve those
documents and similarly we have the type
document type operator which returns
documented field is of only a specific
type specified type now uh if I take an
example here let's say if I'm trying to
find a field uh employee age again and
it is of double uh double integer type
so if I want the particular you know
field data type I can use the type
operator here so this was that was all
about element operator guys and let us
move ahead and finally discuss one of
the main us operator that is array
operators array operators in mongodb are
basically used to query documents that
include a field of arrays now we
basically again have three different
types of operators used in mongodb
the first one is all operator it returns
documents from a collection if it
matches all the values in the specified
array next we have this size operator it
returns documents from The Collection to
match an array with a provided number of
elements in it next and finally we have
LM match which returns those documents
that match specified condition within
each array element now I hope I know it
is bit of confusing so let us just move
ahead and understand with an example
here consider the same uh example again
where we have three documents here now
for first example I have taken the all
operator which is an array operator so
what I'm trying to find is I am trying
to find a element of value which has you
know a notebook and a paper so the query
is followed as DB dot order dot find
orders item all notebook and paper so if
you look into the image I think we have
only uh two documents where we have this
fields are having notebook and a paper
that is the first customer and second
customer if you look into the item name
you have notebook and paper in the first
uh document and second document also we
have item name notebook and paper so it
will retrieve these two documents and
next we have this size so the size
basically retrieve the number of array
elements that you want in your resultant
set now the queries followed as DB dot
order DOT fine where order items is of
size 4. now if you look into three all
the three documents that are present
here we have only one such document
where it has four elements now if you
look at the first document of customer
Rahul order items we have four different
uh you know fields that is he has placed
an order on Notebook play Paper General
and postcard now in contrast if you look
at to the other two uh
documents where we have only notebook
paper and postcard for pranoff and we
have only notebook and postcard for
kirti so which is against uh which does
not satisfy the size operator so it
basically retrieves only the first one
which has four elements or Fields so I
think that was all about the array
operators guys I hope you uh understood
about all the query and projection
operators and it's different types now
again we have uh several many operators
like geospat DL uh comment operator and
so many but which are not that
significant in its usage but anyways if
you want us to cover uh in our further
tutorials let us know wherein will try
to cover a more uh you know detailed
version of it with a hands-on experience
with the mongodb database as well
and finally let us discuss uh what is
upgrade operator guys and basically
mongodb offers a variety of field update
operators to update the values of the
fields and documents matching the
specified condition so it is basically
similar to that of your DML command
which is an update command which is used
to used to update the values in the
columns now similarly in mongodb there
might be a possibility that you have to
update some values and that is where we
have the update field operators now
there are again various such of update
operators so let us just go in through
one by one we have first one as current
date which is used to set the value of a
field to current date either a date or a
timestamp next we have Inc which is
basically increment it is used to
increment the value of the field by the
specified amount next we have the Min
and Max which is used to update the
field if the specified value is less
than the existing field value or it is
greater than the existing field value
next we have the mul which is uh a full
form of multiply it is used to multiply
the value of the field by the specified
amount and finally we have the rename as
a name suggests this operator is used to
rename a field within a document
so that was all about the operators in
mongodb guys I think we have got most
almost all the important operators that
are used frequently on a general basis I
think these are quite enough for you to
perform all the complex operation that
you undertake or to retrieve certain uh
you know documents or values in your
database what are regular expressions in
mover DB regular expressions are used to
match specific patterns in a document it
is basically nothing but finding strings
within a document now it's possible that
you won't always know the precise field
value to search for when retrieving
documents from a collection so in order
to help with the data retrieval based on
search values that match up specific
pattern instead of the whole word or a
string regular Expressions can be used
it comes with multiple options also so
we can customize our query to check if a
field contains a string or not
now why we use regular Expressions now
there are many reasons but these are
some of the important uh factors on why
we use regular expression just like in
any other uh languages we use right so
even we discussed regular expressions in
SQL also in our previous tutorial so if
you haven't checked that out make sure
you uh check that out our channel on SQL
playlist now the first reason is obvious
that it provides patterns or a sequence
of characters for matching text and
Define search patterns now like I said
instead of searching the whole uh value
in a particular field you can just write
a simple pattern that you are aiming to
search for
now it retrieves any unidentified field
in a document easily as well and finally
it queries databases to find a smaller
subset of data within a collection so
instead of retrieving all the fields
again in a document you just you can
retrieve only a portion or a part of
data from that collection using the
regular expressions
now this can be achieved with the help
of the regex operator now what is regex
operator the reex operator provides
regular expression capabilities for
pattern matching strings in the queries
so in in simpler terms using this
operator one can search for the given
string in a specific collection so if
the exact field values are known that a
user is looking for in the document this
operator can turn it handy let us now
understand the syntax of the regets
operator now we have various uh
different types of syntax uh the first
one is a generic syntax where we are
using a delimiter which is uh the syntax
is followed as DB dot collection name
dot file and within the parenthesis
pension the field name that you are
using that you want to find a subset of
data or the uh you know a specific
pattern that you are searching for and
then mention the regex keyword and then
the pattern now if you look at uh the
pattern inside the pattern I have
mentioned it delimiter so
which basically means that you can like
find any pattern of a string value let's
say if I want to find a person's name uh
who has let's say RA in their name so I
can just simply put a delimiter and
inside that I can put a put the two uh
you know strings which is r a so for
example it can match Rahul and and any
such other names uh the same way as well
so in that way you can use the Rex
operator without using any uh without
using actually uh the regex pattern next
we have another uh you know syntax of
the same regex operator which is
mentioned the field and mentioned the
Rex operator using the dollar sign and
let's say if you want to find a specific
character so we use circumflex or to the
power which is a meta character to match
a string at the beginning and we use a
dollar sign at the end to match a
particular string that ends with a
particular value and next we also have
another you know type of Syntax for uh X
operator which is field mention the
field name and the rates keyword and
mention the pattern it can be anything
it can be a generic one where you can
use delimiters or you can even use uh
the circumflex or the dollar sign and
apart from that we can mention the
options as well now we have various
different options like s uh I X and F
now what the S option does is it allows
the dot character to match all the
characters including the new line
characters that you are entering in a
document now we use x as an option to
ignore all white space characters in The
reacts pattern next we have I which is
used to match both upper as well as
lowercase patterns in the string and
finally we use m in order to
specifically search for the circumflex
and the dollar sign inside the string so
if these are not used these anchors
match in the strings end or beginning
now this is a bit confusion for you guys
so let us understand you'll understand
it in a more better way when we get into
the execution part so I hope you
understood what is Rex operator so let's
just start understand how rejects
operator works with a simple example
here now let's say I have a collection
let's say its name is orders and within
the orders collection I have three
different documents here of three uh
different customers like Rahul pranav
and kirti
now let's say if I want to find uh you
know the customer name who has RA in
their name now it can be at the starting
it can be middle or it can be elsewhere
or the in the end I mean so for that I'm
just using a delimiter uh and I'm
mentioning two uh string values that is
R and A so it will only match Rahul
because we have R A and similarly we
have pranav who is also having R and a
uh strings uh characters in in their
name we also have keerthi but she
doesn't have R A so it doesn't match so
we only have we'll get the output of
only these two documents now similarly
let's say if I take another example
wherein I am writing another query which
is DB dot all orders dot find and I
mentioned the field name payment mode
and I'm finding for a particular string
here which starts with C A which is the
payment mode in the document should be
it should start with CA now we have
payment mode as card cash and again we
also have uh card and cash are basically
the two types of cable modes so it will
basically retrieve all the three
documents
so let us now understand another example
here now let's say I've written a query
which says DB dot orders fine payment
mode
uh sorry uh I think there is a mistake
here uh so let's say if the orders item
uh I'm taking the field as order item
and I mentioned the rate at c word again
and here I'm mentioning dollar okay that
means the item name in the orders item
the item name should end with okay so we
have different item names here like
notebook paper General and postcard now
only one item name which is notebook
which has okay in the ending right so
the dollar symbol basically matches the
string in the end so since it has okay
uh the two uh specific strings in the
end of the uh you know document so it
will only match the notebook so since we
have notebook in all the three documents
again we can retrieve the three uh
documents in our final output so this is
how regex operator basically works so
let us now directly jump into mongodb
shell for execution part and see how it
gets executed with some more different
examples
so as you can see uh the database DB
shell has started so let us just use the
show DBS
in order to display the uh database that
are present so we have this simply code
one which will be using again so I'm
just using simple code one
and let us now see the collections
inside this we have the employer
collection so let us just use that so in
order to find the data that is present
we will use the DB dot correction images
employed on find command
so it will display all the documents
that are present
so firstly let us discuss a simple
example where we'll uh simply use the
delimiter operator in order to find
you know the first name of the employees
in our documents whose name can have l i
okay so then we're just providing a
pattern here which is Li so the query
would be DB Dot
employee dot find
open the brackets square brackets and
within the flower packets mention the
field name that is first name
and then mention the delimiter which is
this and our pattern that we are trying
to find is L I write so mention l i
and again close the brackets
and enter
so all right so we can see some of the
documents have been retrieved let's say
if you take the first document here we
have the first name Valli and his full
name is patabala so you can see we have
characters Li at the end here so
similarly if you take the next document
we have Shelley Sim again we have Li at
the end and if you take this example we
have Julia whose name has a like
characters in The between and next we
also have Williams who has Li in between
again so these are the five documents
that are received so irrespective of
whether
irrespective of the position in which
they are it basically retrieves all the
documents that has Li as a substring in
the uh document so in this way you can
use uh the reex operator also simply
without using the regex uh you know
keyword
so let us now understand another example
guys so let us say uh I'm trying to find
a specific pattern where I want to find
the first name of the employees whose
name starts with s h so in that case
what I'll do I'll write a simple query
as
dot DB dot employee dot find
open the brackets mention the field name
which is first name and again now we'll
write the regex keyword here
since we are particularly finding a
pattern which says that the name of the
employee the first name of the employee
should start with only S and H
so mentioned the dollar symbol mention
the array X keyword
and semicolon and then within the uh
double quotes mention the words or the
pattern that you're trying to searching
for so I'm keeping it as S and H so let
us close the noted commas let us close
the flower brackets and
and finally the square brackets I think
we need to mention two flower brackets
so I think we are good to go sorry I
just execute the statement all right so
as you can see in the resultant set we
have some documents being retrieved so
firstly if you look at the uh document
of this one who's the employee whose
first name is Shelly so it's starting
with SH next we also have uh employee ID
123 who's first image Shanta again
starting with SH and similarly we have
embroidery 2.5 whose first name Shelley
starting with SH again so you can use
the Rex operator in this way to only
find a particular pattern
now let us take another scenario here so
if you look at this previous example now
we are mentioning uh the pattern as
capital S and H so it is case sensitive
right so it is already displaying the
records of those employees whose uh
first term is starting with capital S
and the second letter which is small H
so let's say in in a different scenario
we want uh all the employees name whose
name is having uh let's say capital S as
well as well as Capital H so in that
case you need to use the options uh you
know command so let's say again if I am
trying to find the first name of an
employee uh whose uh first name starts
with ju so it can be capital j or small
U so in that case you need to use the
options and the option that we are going
to take is which is basically I
so I'm just going to uh execute this
statement so just follow it with me DB
Dot
employee Dot find
and within the square brackets
open the square brackets and the flower
brackets first name
and open the flower brackets again
mention the dollar sign
mention the regex keyword
again semicolon now the pattern that I
am searching is ju it can be anything so
we are just going for case insensitive
here now for that we have to basically
use the options command here so mention
the dollar sign
options is the keyword
and mention the colon
and within the Brack uh inverted quotes
mention I
so what basically this I does is it will
retrieve all the records irrespective of
whether they are in uppercase or
lowercase so
let us just close the form of brackets
again and let us executed
so as you can see we have only uh one uh
record or one document that is being
retrieved which is of Julia Dyer now if
you look at the command that we have
taken as small J and small U but in the
resultant output the uh the the document
is that which has been retrieved is
capital J and small U so in this way you
can use the options uh you know command
you have to find all the documents
irrespective of whether they are in a
smaller case or uppercase so that was
one another scenario guys so finally let
us look into another scenario where you
want to find
you know a specific document starting
with a particular uh substring or sub or
a pattern or a value and ending with the
pro a particular value
so firstly let us take uh
an example of uh you know this document
wherein will search for the job ID which
starts with AC so in that case the
following query would be DB dot employee
dot find
mention the flower brackets
so we are taking as job ID which is our
field name
mention the regex keyword again
so the pattern that we are searching for
is so circumflex you have to mention
this uh symbol which is a meta character
and the job ID should start with A and C
so it is must so this condition
basically checks for all the job IDs the
name of java IDs starting with AC
so let us just close this and
enter
all right so in the resultant output we
have two different documents present so
if you look at the first document we
have job ID as AC MGR and next to the
second job ID we have AC accountant
so this was another scenario where we
are using uh you know where we are
finding documents only uh with us with
the help of the regex operator and a
search pattern wherein we are only
finding the job ID of those employees
whose uh job ID name starts with AC
so that gives you the end of today's
session guys I hope uh you've understood
uh all about mongodb a regex operators
and how to use them I did now projection
in mongodb is a special type of feature
guys that is used to select only a
certain part of the data without
selecting the entire data present inside
the document
so more on that soon but before we get
started uh let's discuss the agenda for
today's session
what are the tutorial by understanding
what is our DB projection and then we
will understand why we use projection
and more and after that we'll have a how
projection Works in mongodb turn its
syntax usage and next we'll discuss
projection queries with the help of
certain examples and finally we'll
execute those examples in mongodb server
I hope I made myself clear with the
agenda alert what is mongodb projection
now mongodb projection helps to return
the specific fields from the query or
you can see from The mongodb Collection
Now by this collection
documents
now as you know mongodb is a schema LS
database which is a nosql database and
has a different structure to that of
relational database now the tables in
relational database are called as
collection rows are called columns and
we may not want all the records from the
collection but a few of them in the
resultant set so in that case we use
mongodb projection using projection
document which is used to limit the
amount or fields in the data present in
that document so in a nutshell if I
would say rejection means selecting only
then
necessary data
other than select
in the whole of the data present in the
document now similarly as to that of
where conditional Clause that we use in
SQL because if I have a document which
has 10 fields
and why we use a popular nosql and open
source document oriented database which
allows for highly scalable and flexible
document structure which is faster than
relational database because of its
efficient storage and indexing uh
techniques and being a nosql database it
is designed to handle large amounts of
data so DB will process a lot of
unnecessary data and you want when you
want to retrieve specific information
from a large number of Records so to
overcome this problem we use projection
query now some of the reasons Now when
using projection to remove unused or any
sales the military server will have to
fetch each document into its memory and
then filter the results to return uh
actually reduce the memory usage but can
save the significant network band for
query results depending on the data
model and the fields projected in your
documents and it only returns indexed
query results without fetching the full
documents now which is basically the
main use case of projection which
basically eliminates all the fields that
are unnecessary for the user and
particular Fields within the document
then he can use the production area
operator
and finally data without the overall
database is performance now
by default is return all fields and
matching documents so if you need all
the details it's returning
full documents is going to be more
efficient having a server manipulate the
result projection however then to
reprove performance and that is one of
the main uh consideration when we are
using mongodb projection so these are
some of the reasons on why we use
mongodb projection
all right let us now understand how
mongodb projection works now in general
to retrieve the data from the uh
documents we use the find method uh
which retrieves data from all the fields
within a document without any filtering
so let us now understand the syntax of
mongodb projection operator now the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name DOT fine and within the path this
is mention the field names that is I'm
taking your field one and its
corresponding value field 2 and value 2.
now
the values that I'm talking about is if
field value is as 1 which is a Boolean
expression uh which is equals to us it
will basically show the data in that
field field value is if the Boolean
expected hides the data in the field so
let us understand this with an example
guys I the only then you will get a
clear understanding of it now I have
let's say a collection of uh certain
documents let's say the collection name
is orders and I have three such
documents here which has various Fields
like ID customer address payment mode
email order total and Order items now if
I want to display all these documents uh
what I'll do I'll basically write a
query using the find method which is
followed as DB dot orders DOT fine so it
will basically retrieve all the
documents without restricting any of the
fields that are present in our
collection
now let's say if I want only particular
field that I want to display in my
resultant cell now let's say if I have
uh the payment mode and the order total
field and I want only them to display in
the resultant set without displaying all
the fields that are present in each of
the document so in that case I'll write
a query as DV dot orders dot find and
inside the parenthesis I'll mention
payment mode colon 1 and order total is
one now since I've set the field value
to 1 it will only retrieve those values
and similarly for order total also it
will retrieve only that particular field
value so this will basically be the
output of our resultant set that is it
will show the ID object the payment mode
of the three documents and similarly the
order total of the three documents Now
by default we have the underscore ID
which is a default value which we cannot
change it so if if at all if you want to
override and change it you can mention
it to 0 now let's say uh I'm taking the
same example here now instead of just
writing payment mode to one and order
total to one I'm adding another uh you
know constraint or I'm using I'm
projecting another field which is of ID
and I'm setting it to zero now if you
see in a result and set we do not have
the ID field so in this way you can use
projection in order to restrict certain
fields from your resultant table set
without actually retrieving all the data
that is present in your documents so let
us now jump into shell and execute
this example and see how it is working
so as you can see uh shell has
been started now I don't want to get
into the details of all of it I will
cover uh in a separate tutorial where
we'll understand how to create a
database and how to create a collection
in mongodb separately guys stay tuned to
the channel for that so we'll just cover
uh how we'll Implement mongodb uh
projection with certain examples here
now the basically uh in order to
retrieve the databases that are present
in our mongodb we have to use the
command as show DBS so it will list out
all the databases that are present we
have admin config local and simply code
one now I have already created uh this
simply code one and hindsight before
itself so that they can save a bit of
time and I've also created a collection
in that so before you see the collection
and the documents that are present in it
you have to use uh the simply code
database so for that we'll do the simply
code one as our Command so as you can
see it is saying that switch to DB
simply got now if you want to find all
The Collection that are present in
database you have to uh basically
write as
social collections so it will list out
all the collections in that now as you
can see I have a collection that is of
employee here so for example I will
consider this same collection now I have
this below collection named as employee
with uh let's say certain number of
documents in that now if I query the
collection in the shell if I write
a command to it to return all the
documents or fields from the matching
documents by default it will basically
it will return all your documents so for
that I will use a statement like which
is of DB
dot mention the collection name that is
employee dot find so file method is used
to list out all the documents so you can
just see that we have a lot of documents
in our resultant Set uh let me just
scroll and go to the top so as you can
see we have different documents a number
of documents and it has different fields
like ID employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID and so
on so you can see we have a lot of
documents so let's just count how many
documents we have for that you can use
the count statement
so
DB dot employee dot count so you can see
we have a total of 50 documents present
in our employee collection now if you
look at our resultant set after we used
the find method you can see it has
returned all the fields of the document
from The Collection now but what if I
want to fetch only a particular field
like let's say first name last name
email or even their salary
how will we do that now the answer is
using mongodb projection we will Project
Specific fields to return from the query
now so before proceeding to mongodb
projection guys let's recall how we
fetch certain fields from you know our
traditional SQL database so that we can
have a clear understanding now let's say
suppose The Collection employee is a
table in SQL and let's say all the
fields like employee ID first name last
name so on RX columns now I want to
fetch the only uh the let's say first
name last name
uh from the table so in that case what
we'll write will basically write a query
as select first name
last name from a table that is employee
right I hope I'm clear with this so it
is similar to that in mongodb wherein we
are executing this query as uh using
projection so let us now see how we do
projection here
so let's just uh consider as an example
here now let's say I'm writing a command
as DB dot employee dot find
and let's say if I want to fix all the
documents of all the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so in that case
what I'll do is Department
so it is says a case sensitive guy so
make sure you write in the capitals or
whatever the field is written as
so mention the column and within the
double quotes mention 30.
so close the parenthesis and close the
square brackets as well so it will
basically list out as you can see all
the documents of the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so we can see we
have employee ID of the employee 114 115
116 117 118 and 119 whose all their
department is 30.
now again even if I am returning a
particular field or a condition it is
also you know retrieving all the fields
from all the documents now I don't want
that now I want only a particular field
so what in that case we will project
certain Fields without returning all the
fields from our documents so let us see
how it works so the query is followed as
DB Dot mention the collection name
employee
find
open the square brackets
and let's say uh I want to retrieve only
the first name
first name so I'm setting it as one
as we discussed earlier if you want to
retrieve the particular field you have
to mention one and similarly I want to
mention I want to retrieve the last name
as well
last name
column and one and also let us take
another field let's say a salary
right we have salary also let us just
retrieve that as well as one
all right close the parenthesis and
close the square brackets and enter so
we do not have any output here guys that
is because we haven't mentioned the
parenthesis uh before the find method so
let me just copy paste and we'll see how
it is
so before after the find we'll have to
mention the uh parenthesis again
foreign
so as you can see in a resultant set now
since we have only mentioned the first
name last name and the salary it is only
displaying the results
only those only certain fields that is
the first name last name and salary in a
result and set now by default this ID
object is uh you know retrieved uh with
the command so if you want to eliminate
that as well you can keep the ID to zero
so let us just execute that so let me
just copy this again
paste it and mention another uh criteria
that is
the field now the field should be
I feel that is of ID should be zero
so close the parenthesis
so let us just execute this and we'll
see how it is the output so as you can
see now only we have the first name last
name and salary of all the employees so
we have just basically eliminated the
object idea as well so if you want uh
only uh the first name last name and
salary in your output you can just
mention the field names and mention one
if you want to display your resultant
set and if you want to display if you do
not want to display those certain Fields
you can mention as zero so in this way
you can use the projection query
operator in order to project only
certain fields from all the documents so
yes I guess that was all about the
mongodb projection guys uh now
projection query operator can be quite
useful when you are handling a lot of
unstructured data let's say if the
database has like 10 000 or even a
million records in such case if you want
to return a specific number of fields
only now a document can have any number
of fields like 10 20 30 40 and so on so
in some cases if you want to retrieve
our specify only certain number of
fields in your resultant set in that
case projection operator can be quite
useful and I know it is quite confusing
at the beginning so it just need you
just need more practice to understand
this in a more better way
so
that brings us to the end of today's
session guys I hope you have understood
all the topics and Concepts covered in
so sorting and limiting uh one of the
necessary database operations it helps
to simplify and the readability of the
data and sort the data as per the user
requirement now when you're working on
huge chunks of data in a database both
sorting and limit operations can be
quite uh handful to understand and
visualize data in order to get
meaningful information out of it and
retrieve only the specified number of
Records accordingly as per your need so
in this tutorial you will learn all
about the sorting and limiting Concepts
and how it can be implemented in mongodb
database
so before getting into the execution
part let us quickly understand what is
sorting in mongodb sorting is the
ordering of data in an increasing and
increasing order based on set of
relationships between the various data
items present in the database now
sorting can be done on any entities
having information like ID name is
address or any data type having numbers
or string values now sorting improves
the readability and consistency of the
data displayed from the database so in a
nutshell sorting is done just like in
any other database or programming
language that involves arranging data
into some meaningful information to make
it easier to understand analyze or
visualize let us understand its syntax
the syntax is simple it is followed as
DB dot collection name find dot sort and
within the parenthesis mention the field
and the order so let us understand how
it is now for sorting your mongodb
documents you need to make use so this
sort method so this method will accept a
document that has a list of fields and
the order for sorting so for indicating
the Sorting order you have to set the
value 1 or -1 with this specific entity
based on which the ordering will be set
and displayed so if the order is is one
it will basically
uh sort the records in ascending order
that is in an increasing manner and if
you mention the order is -1 it will
basically sort sort the uh data in the
descending order that is in a decreasing
manner so one indicates organizing data
in ascending order while -1 indicates
organizing in descending order so that
was all about the Sorting in mongodb so
let us now understand how sort method
Works in mongodb with an example now
consider a collection name orders now if
I just run a command DB dot orders DOT
fine I'll get these collection which has
three documents so it has uh details of
three customers like Rahul pranav and
kirti right so let us now run a query
where I'm using a sort method here which
is followed as DB dot orders dot file
and within the parenthesis I am
basically uh projecting the query ID so
that we will not have it in our
resultant set so and also I'm sorting
the data based on the customer here so
I'm mentioning customer
as well so that means it will basically
order in
the ascending order so this will be the
output guys now the output is now first
you'll have the customer uh details of
kirti because the letter alphabet K
starts first in the alphabets uh from A
to Z next we have pranam which starts
with p and then we have Rahul which
starts with r so this is a simple
example on how sorting method Works in
mongodb now let's say if I want to sort
multiple fields in a collection so in
what way will I be able to do it now let
us consider an example here let's say I
have a pet info collection here and we
have various records or you can say
documents and we have uh like various
Fields like name of the pet type and its
weight now let's say if I want to sort
multiple Fields uh within this
collection so I would write a query as
DB dot The Collection name which is pet
info DOT fine dot sort and next I am
sorting this collection based on its
type its weight and finally the ID
so type I'm giving it as one which will
basically do in an ascending order which
is an increasing manner whereas I am
doing uh the Sorting on the weight field
as minus 1 which is in decreasing order
that is in descending order that is from
highest to lowest and then I'm also
sorting the field ID as uh ascending
order that is I'm giving it as one
so when I run this command in mongodb
Shell this will uh this will what we are
basically basically the output of the
collection right so let us just
understand how it is working
now first I am uh sorting the data based
on that type now the Sorting is done
based on the priority that is given that
is first you have given the uh sorting
input as type then weight and the ID so
it will run the Sorting based on this
sequence only
so if you look at the first uh record of
the document we have uh the cad data
that is the we have three uh records of
cads uh having the same uh type right so
we have Lily Millie and Oliver which is
of type cat so basically it will arrange
those in ascending order since we have C
which is the starting or the uh
alphabetical or order of the alphabets
uh which comes uh the C comes first then
we have dog next we have kangaroo now
since we have uh the same records or the
same record of cat that is repeating
then it will check weight now since we
have given weight as minus 1 that is
from descending order that is why we
have the record of Lily whose weight is
12 at the first place next the uh
details of Millie whose weight is eight
and finally we have Oliver whose weight
is seven
so this means that if there are multiple
pets of the same type those pets are
sorted by their weight in must a
descending order now if there are
multiple pets with both the same type as
well as weight then those pets are
sorted by the ID field which you have
given to sort them in ascending order
now if we hadn't included the ID field
in the Sorting process then those pets
of the same type and the uh sorting
process then those threads of the same
type and weight could appear in any
order guys so without having a sort
field on a unique field such as the ID
field it would be entirely possible that
the result would come back in different
order when we run the query each time so
I hope you understood how the Sorting
works when we want to sort multiple
Fields within a document
so let us now understand what is limit
in mongodb the limit method in mongodb
is used to limit the number of Records
this method takes only one number type
of argument which is basically the
number of documents that you want to
display in your resultant set similarly
which we used to do in SQL also wherein
if we have like thousands of Records you
use the limit clause in order to
restrict a certain number of records and
specify only certain records in a
resultant set now the syntax is followed
as db.collection name dot file limit and
value now in the value you can give as
per your choice let's say if I give the
value as 5 it will display the first
five records or the documents from that
collection and similarly you can also
uh use the projection where you can
display the fields as per your
requirement by giving the values and
also the limit value and simultaneously
you can also sort the data and the limit
uh and limit those uh collections or
Limitless documents in the collections
as well and the syntax is followed as
db.collection name DOT fine dot sort
field order you can give multiple field
names in the Sorting uh you know
parenthesis and mention the limit method
and you can give the values that is
number of uh Records that you want to
fetch in a resultant table so let us now
understand again how limit Works in DB
now again let us consider uh the orders
collection here now let's say if I want
to limit these collections now if I want
to retrieve only the first two documents
from this then the query would be DB dot
orders dot file limit and within the
time this I'm mentioning as two so this
would is this would be the output
wherein you will get the details of
Rahul and pranav which are basically the
first two documents which are present in
our collection order all right now what
if you want to sort and as well as limit
the data now what I'm doing here is I'm
basically projecting the ID field so I'm
keeping it as 0 so that we do not have
this in a resultant set next I'm sorting
uh this collection orders based on the
customers so I am giving customer as one
which will basically
sort the documents of the customers in
an ascending manner that is from lowest
to highest and then I'm limiting these
documents for only two values so uh when
I run this query this would be the
output
so customer I'm basically sorting in
ascending order so first we'll have
kirti and similarly next we have product
in an alphabetical order which is
following the alphabetical condition
starting from A to Z and since I am also
using the limit Clause here up to two
values it will only retrieve the first
two values
so this is how limit Works in mongodb
guys I hope you've got a better
understanding on how limit works you
know the conserving this simple examples
so let us now jump into mongodb shell
with a proper execution and see how it
gets executed
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started and let us consider the
simplifier database again so let us
write the command as you simply code one
which will basically select the simple
code one database and
let us see what are the collections
present in it and we have the employee
collection so let us just retrieve the
data that is present in this so I'm
using the find method DP Dot and send
the collection name and mention the fine
method so it will retrieve all the data
that is present in it so we have uh data
like employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID
so firstly let us discuss some example
choosing the Sorting technique guys uh I
think we already have employee IDs in
alphabet I mean in sorted order so let's
just take another field let us sort the
manager ID field here so
the following query would be DB dot
employee
dot find
mention this sort
and within the sort mention the field
name which is manager ID
so I'm giving the order as one which
will uh sort the order in ascending
order
so close the parenthesis and let us
execute this
so basically you can type it to retrieve
all the records that are present so let
us just understand how it is working uh
let me just scroll back
you have so many requests guys so it's
better we use the project field uh so
that we can have a clear understanding
so next time we'll use that
so this is our query which you have
executed now now since I've sorted the
manager ID in ascending order which I
have given the order value as one as you
can see uh since we do not have any
manager ID for this employee Stephen
King next we have the manager IDs 100
and next similarly we have hundred
hundred hundred
100 and so on and next we have one not
one
and one not a so as you can clearly see
114 as well uh so you can clearly see
that our data has been sorted in
ascending order when we are using this
sorting technique so let us now
understand how we can do that with
another
you know sequence that is let us keep it
as minus one so in that case what it
will be is DV dot employee find
so I'm going to project some of the
fields because uh I don't want all these
uh you know unnecessary fields in my
resultant set so I'll just uh opt them
out so I don't want ID field
so I'm keeping it as 0
and I want first name
my resultant set so I'm keeping first
name next I want last name as well
keeping it as one and next last name
uh
and let's say uh finally manager ID only
okay
manager
ID
has one close the parenthesis now
mention the sort keyword
open the parenthesis mention the
field that you want to sort
in the way that is manage your ID
[Music]
so it is important that you mention
manager ID in the projection field right
so if you do not mention and if you are
sorting manager ID without explicitly
calling it so you will get an error it
won't display so it is important that
you mention the manager ID in the
projection field also
close the brackets I think we are good
to go let us just recheck our code
oh okay okay right so I think there is
an error in the manager ID guys so let
me just copy this you know
so you might have a technical error so
make sure you give the correct name of
the field name otherwise you'll get an
error so I think we are good to go now
so let us just like figure this
statement and we'll see the output so as
you can clearly see that in a result and
Set uh we are only fetching the first
name last name and manager ID since we
have projected some of the fields uh in
a resultant set and I'm sorting the data
based on the uh based on the manager ID
field and since I've given it as one it
will uh sort the data in ascending order
that is from lowest to highest so if you
can see the first
manager ID is 100 so list of all the
employees whose manager ID is hundred
has been shown next we have one not one
one or three uh similarly if you type it
we'll have the rest of the records as
well so you can see next one not eight
one fourteen 120 and so on 120 to 123 to
not one two not five so in this way you
can sort my uh various documents in
order of how you want to display or show
them in your resultant set
all right I hope you understood this
till now uh let us now sort multiple
field guys so let me just copy this
query
now again like as we discussed earlier
in in our presentation sorting multiple
Fields is not a big task it is just
simply that you have to add the uh
multiple Fields here so manager ID as
well as let's take salary also
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sort salary in uh descending order so
I'm mentioning it as minus one and also
let us uh project the field here as well
so salary
has one all right so let us execute this
statement and we'll see the output
so as you can see in a resultant set
after sorting the data based on the
fields of manager ID and salary if you
look at the output now since we have
sorted our manager ID in ascending order
since you have specified one as the
order it will uh basically sort the
order in ascending order that is from
lowest to highest and salary we have
mentioned the order as minus one so it
will do the opposite of that that is it
will sort the data in descending order
that is from highest to lowest so if you
look at the resultant output here guys
now since we have no manager ID for this
which is uh taken as let's say the least
value or zero so it is displaying first
next we have the salary minus one so if
you look at to the manager IDs uh of the
next uh like let's say four now since we
have the manager ID hundred which is the
lowest value and we have four same or
four or more uh same values then it will
move on to the next priority that we
have given to sort our document that is
salary so first now we have 82 000 as
our salary that is from descending order
it will uh basically sort the data in uh
descending order that is from highest to
lowest so we have 80 to 1000 next we
have 80 000 next we have seventy nine
thousand eight hundred next we have six
thousand five hundred fifty eight
thousand next we have 1700 1700
similarly and so on
so in this way you can sort multiple
Fields using the sort method as well I
hope you've understood how the sort
method Works uh in mongodb guys uh using
the single field or using multiple field
sorting how you can basically arrange
the data based on your name
all right let us now uh discuss some
examples using the limit Clause again
limit Clause is very easy guys it is
used to restrict or specify only certain
number of Records in a resultant set and
the uh
syntax is followed as DB dot mention the
employee name DB dot Empire dot find
dot let's say limit I want only five
records of the uh you know employee
collection so I'm mentioning as Phi as
my value and when you enter uh when you
press the enter you can see the
resultant output has only five five
documents one two three
four and five so this is a simple
example of how you can use limit now you
can also use the limit using the sort
method as well so let us just copy this
and we will see how it gets executed
so let me just paste it here
now I'm just adding the limit method
here I want only let's say the first
four
okay now what I'm doing is I'm first
basically projecting some of the fields
that is the required number of years
that I want to fetch in my resultant set
then I am basically sorting this
documents in the uh manner of manager ID
salary in order of ascending order from
manager ID since we are given one and in
the order of descending order for salary
since we have given at -1 and I am
limiting the resultant uh you know
output to only four records so when I
press enter you can see we have only the
first four records so we have no manager
ID again next week if we consider the
manager ID here hundred for Adam Fripp
whose manager ID is 100 and next two
also we have this same manager ID here
guys so now the next uh thing is it will
go on to this salary like we discussed
earlier the salary is uh sorted here in
descending order from highest to lowest
so we have 82 000 next we have 80 000
next we have seventy nine thousand so
similarly if you can
uh let's say let's limit to another
example let's say if I'm limiting to 10
all right so in that case it will
basically fetch the first n record so as
you can see one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten so all of them are
basically uh the records of the
employees whose manager ID is 100 and it
is basically arranging all the details
of the employees for salary in ascending
in descending order that is in the order
of minus one which we have specified
so that brings us to the end of today's
session guys I hope you all have
understood all about the sort and the uh
limit method that we use in a good
indexing strategy is essential for
ensuring that your you know database
returns your results as quickly as
possible now just like any other
relational databases where we perform
indexing similarly indexing in mongodb
is also a way to organize information so
that the database engine can quickly
find the relevant results more on that
soon but before we get started let us
first discuss the agenda for today's
session
in today's tutorial we'll be going
through different concepts wherein we'll
cover what are indexes in mongodb and
then we'll understand why is indexing
used in mongodb and up next we'll
discuss how does indexing work and then
we'll understand how to create an index
and after that we'll be going through
different types of indexes used in
mongodb and finally we'll end this
session uh with syntax and execution in
mongodb Shell I hope I made myself clear
with the agenda part so let us just go
ahead and understand what are indexes in
mongodb
so what are indexes in mongodb now
mongodb index is a special data
structure on which the data is on which
the index is created to hold the date of
specific fields of document now in the
absence of uh you know fields in the
fields and indexing in mongodb there is
a need to scan every collection document
to select those uh that match the query
statement now this scan requires mongodb
to process a large volume of data and is
highly efficient so if there is no
indexing done on a collection of let's
say thousands of documents your query
will keep finding specific documents in
order however mongodb would limit and
make it clear the number of documents to
be searched within your collection if
your documents have indexes so with the
help of indexes when they are applied at
the collection level it can store the
value of a specific field or set of
fields ordered by the value of the field
so those were that is what indexes are
in mongodb
let us now understand why is indexing
used in mongodb now mongodbs indexes
make it unnecessary to perform a
collection scan now from that what I
mean is collections can basically
involve looking through every document
in a collection that matches to your
query that you have written to find a
particular or document or a field that
you are trying to return so when you
provide an indexing on documents let's
say on a database that you have like a
thousands or 50 000 records you can just
simply put an index which will improve
the search efficiency as well now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or multiple Fields And even
though a mongodb database can hold a lot
of data you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly and effectively
access the data you require from it and
finally indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which automatically
brings search efficiency in various
executions of statements all right
moving ahead let us now understand how
to create an index now creating an index
in mongodb is done by using the create
index method
foreign
go through the syntax uh so the syntax
is followed as db.collection name dot
create index is the keyword and make
sure the i in index is capital otherwise
it will throw an error within the
parenthesis mention the field name that
you want to create an index on and next
we have one or minus one so one of these
following syntax shows how to add an
index to our collection so let us assume
we have you know same uh like employee
collection which is an example which has
various Fields name like employee ID
name salary or so on but for this I'm
creating an index on employee name and
I'm specifying as one now the one
parameter indicates that when the index
is created with the employee name field
value they should be sorted in ascending
order now please you have to note that
it is different from the you know
hashtag ID which is the by default ID
which is uh you know created when you
are creating a document so the ID field
is used to uniquely identify each
document in a collection which is
created automatically in the collection
by mongodb and the document will now be
sorted as per the employee name and not
the ID field
so I hope you've understood how to
create an example you will get a clear
cut idea when we go into the execution
part in mongodb so make sure to watch
the video till the end guys
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of indexes used in
mongodb now there are mainly three types
of indexes in mongodb the first one is
single field index next we have the
compounds compound index and finally we
have the multi-key index let us discuss
about each of them in detail now now we
know that a field in a document in a
collection can be indexed individually
so as the name suggests single field
index is used to create an index or only
a single field in a document So Below is
an example and the syntax for single
fill index uh on an uh tape on a
collection named as orders so the syntax
is db.collection name dot create index
and within the parenthesis field name so
you can either index them in the order
of ascending or descending by mentioning
one or minus one so I have considered an
example here of orders a collection
where I've created a index on a field
called price and I am mentioning as -1
so it will basically index in descending
order that is from highest to lowest
next we have the compound index now
compound index is formed when multiple
fields are combined into a one single
index so a compound index is General an
index that holds a reference to multiple
Fields within a collection so for
example I have taken another uh
collection I mean the same collection of
orders and I am creating an index where
I am creating index of multiple Field
Services which is for price and for
customer name so again the syntax is
same which is DB dot mentioned the
collection name dot create index which
is the keyword and within the
parenthesis you can give as much as many
as you know field names to your name to
your sorry to your collection
so I hope you have understood what is
copper index as well so and finally we
have what is uh multi-key index now
mongodb supports a multi-key index for
each element inside the array for an
array field so these elements consist of
you know scalar Fields like string
values integer values or even nested
objects now the uh syntax is same you
just have to mention uh the collection
uh name and mention the create index
keyword and within the parenthesis
mention the field name which is of only
array type so multi-key index you know
automatically creates a multi key index
on an array by knowing its structure so
therefore you need not additionally
Define a multi key index in such case so
no additional definition is required as
such so let us understand with an
example here now let's say I have a
document here
uh different documents like I have three
different documents in a collection of
orders which has various Fields such as
ID customer address payment mode email
order total and Order items now if you
look at this collection I have order
items which has an array values for
example we have for first ID for
customer Rahul we have four different
array values of order items like item
name notebook and item name paper item
name Journal item name postcard so if I
want to create a multi-key index I'll
just simply write a query as DB dot
orders dot create index and within the
parenthesis mention the collection uh
mention the field name that is which is
order items and on which you want to
perform multi-key indexing now I want to
perform uh indexing on price which is a
array value within a collection right so
that is what I'm taking is order items
dot price and the order in which it will
index is ascending so for that I am
giving the parameter as one so with that
we have covered all the three different
main types of uh indexing indexes that
we generally use in mongodb so let us
now switch into mongodb for execution
part and see how they actually perform
now we do not clearly see that how the
indexing is going but it will definitely
improve the search efficiency if you are
working on you know more than you know
let's say thousands and thousands of
Records
so let us now jump into uh
mongodb shelf for execution part
all right so as you can see mongodb
shell has started and firstly let us see
uh what are the databases that are
present so for that I'll use the short
DBS and we'll again use the simply code
one or DBS that we have all previously
used so use simply code
one
it says switch to Simply code now if you
want to find all the collections that
are present in that you just have to
write show collections so we have one
collection which is employee so we'll
use that so in order to find the values
or the documents that are present in
this collection we'll just write the DB
command which is DB dot employee dot
find
so it will just display all the values
type it for all the values so as you can
see we have various different documents
in this so when this perform a simple
index now we'll just create a single
field index now which is basically a
normal field index that you create so
the query would be DB Dot
employee
create
mention the create index keyword and
within the parenthesis uh so let us just
create uh you know our index on salary
field here right so mention the salary
field
mention the hyphen and we will uh Index
this in ascending order so I am giving
the parameter here as one so let us
execute this statement so when you
execute the statement it says salary
underscore one which is basically means
your index that you have created which
is has been successfully executed
so now that you've created your index
and if you want to view uh what are the
indexes that you have created you need
to use the get indexes keyword so let's
just find again so I'll use the
statement DB dot employee which is a
collection name now you need to use the
get indexes make sure the I is capital
otherwise you will find an error get
indexes and when you enter uh the end
when you enter this and you will find
this a list of following uh indexes that
you have created now I have already now
as I said earlier in the tutorial the ID
field is automatically created uh
within the you know database which uh
you know automatically creates the index
for the uh underscore ID but additional
to that I've already created email uh
index on our you know employee table and
just now I have created the salary index
also so you can see the list of all
these uh you know indexes that you have
created now let's say if you want to
or not delete or drop any of the index
that you have created so in that case
you have to use the drop index so I'll
just uh you know write the statement
again which is DB dot employee dot uh
mention the keyword drop index
okay and within the parenthesis mention
the index that you want to drop so let's
say if I want to drop the email I find
it unnecessary now so I'll just write
the email uh you know key key which is a
field and I'll mention this one and I'll
just close the compare emphasis and I'll
close the brackets as well so as you can
see it says okay uh you know this it
says end indexes uh is three and okay
one that means if finally you know drop
the index so we'll just use again this
you know get index and see whether it is
successfully deleted or not
let's just copy paste here and let us
enter so now you can see that we have
only two fields which is the underscore
ID which is you know by default which is
the index that I've created by the
database itself and additionally we have
the salary index that we have created
earlier and successfully we have deleted
the email
index from our collection or the
database so I hope you've understood
till now so that is what uh you know
index is about you know you just create
index to improve the search efficiency
now behind the uh database the
performance optimization or the
efficiency can be achieved which cannot
be viewed outside so I hope you
understood how to create a single field
here well let us now move to compound
index and we'll see how to create it
also
earlier you can use multiple fields in a
mongodb document to create a compound
index so I'll just create a compound
index on another
Fields so I'll just
create index
and within the parenthesis okay let us
now create uh you know index for let's
say job ID
job ID I am giving it as minus 1 the
order mention the comma
and let us create an index for let's say
Department ID as well
giving this a parameter one it will
basically index in the ascending order
so close the parenthesis
so as you can see it is saying job ID 1
Department ID one that is me that means
you have successfully created the index
so let's just uh confirm whether they
have created or not
so let us copy paste again
so now as you can see we have another
two indexes that we have created which
says you know job ID and for Department
ID as well
so this is how you can create a compound
index in your mongodb database as well
so in the compound uh in the above
component is that well we have created
the mongodb will first sort by the job
ID in the descending order since we have
provided minus 1 as the parameter it
will basically sort all the documents in
the descending order then with each
department ID it will sort in ascending
order since you have provided the
parameter as one now the index would
create a similar data structure for the
Department ID also which basically sorts
the data in the ascending order so that
brings us to the final which is
multi-key index now I don't think we
have you know array of fields or the
array of data in our document documents
so that we can perform uh but for now I
think I hope you understood how to
implement multi-key multi key index as
well it just suppose supports indexing
of array of data so when you create an
index for a field containing an array
mongodb will create a separate index
entries for every element in the array
data
so I think we've already almost covered
all the topics that we have discussed in
our agenda and I hope you guys have
understood as well so that brings us to
the end of today's session guys I hope
you've understood what are indexes and
how they are used you know to uh search
the data in a efficient and a more quick
way so defining indexes are important
you know for faster and efficient
searching of documents in a collection
and these indexes can be created by the
uh using Create index method so I'm just
recapping what we have covered and
indexes can be created on just one field
by using the single field index method
or multiple Fields using the compound
index and you can even create indexes on
array of fields using the multi-key
index as well what is Advanced indexing
now we all know what indexing is mongodb
Right which is an essential component
which improves the performance of the
data retrieval speed in the database so
mongodb indexing is a special data
structure on which the index is created
to hold the data of specific fields of
documents and in the absence of indexing
in mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection document to select those that
match the query statement now in our
previous tutorial on indexing in mongodb
we have just covered the basic uh you
know indexing techniques like on single
field and comp and compound Fields right
so now what if the database is working
on array of uh Fields within a
collection right uh so let's say if I
have a student's database and in that I
am working on sub documents that is
documents that have array of fields in
them so in such case the indexing
becomes quite difficult
so if there is no indexing done on a
collection of thousands of document your
query will keep finding specific
document in order be it a single field
of multiple fields or even array of
fields so it becomes quite difficult you
know to retrieve the value so indexes
are applied at the collection level and
it can store the value of specific field
or a set of fields so before jumping
into why uh I mean how exactly Advanced
indexing works on you know array of
fails let us understand uh you know why
why we need Advanced indexing you know
in addition to the normal indexing that
we do in mongodb so for that let us jump
into my mongodb compass for explanation
foreign so as you can see mongodb
Compass has started and in a database
simply code 1 we have two different
collection that is employee and new
employees here now if you if I click at
the new employees it basically opens uh
the document Fields now you can see we
have like almost around 33 000 documents
and we have one index which is basically
done on the ID field if you look at go
to the indexes page we have the ID field
which is already indexed now if you
consider these many documents right
these huge tons of amounts of documents
like we have 33k and if I try to find
a particular document let's say I want
to file uh a name you know based on the
name I am trying to field
uh I think we have different names here
right so let's just take Department here
right so we have Department field
so I'm just finding value like let's say
uh I'm trying to find all the documents
which has polis as the department name
so I'll just write polish and try to
search it so close the brackets and let
us try to find
so it will basically find all the
documents or within the collection that
has Department as police here now if I
go to the explanation of this right
let's just click on explanation now if I
uh look the query performance of this uh
document or the query that I've written
for uh you know to find the details of
all the uh you know employees or the
people working in a company and the
background I'm trying to find what all
uh the documents that I want here right
so if you look at here we have a total
of thirty two thousand nine Twenty Eight
documents and in that we have documents
returned are thirteen thousand five
ninety
now it indirectly impacts the
performance guys now if you see we have
33 000 documents it is searching each
and every document where the department
uh is police so and after searching each
and every record a record it is
basically retrieving all the documents
so we have around 13590 which is close
to around 14k and if you look at the
actual query time it is around 23
milliseconds so that is quite a huge uh
you know amount of time for a database
to process such information now let's
say if I have like Millions like 10
lakhs or 15 lakhs of documents in such
case the time taken is more so in such
case we'll basically create an index
here now we all know how to create a
single index and a multiple index so
let's just create an index and we'll see
how it actually affects the uh you know
bigquery performance so I'm just
creating an index on Department field
and I'm basically indexing in ascending
so I'm just basically one I'm keeping it
as one so as you can see we have created
successfully uh the index for the
Department uh field here so let us now
try to uh find uh the data that is the
Department of that is the employees or
the people working as a police
so and if I try to sign this and if I go
to the EXP again explanation part
so you can see now we have a total of
Thirteen thousand five ninety documents
now instead of searching all the
documents that is 33 000 we can directly
reference a refer only those documents
that are required to us so you can see
index key examined only 13 590 and you
can see actual query execution time has
reduced a bit more like 17 Ms I think
that is also quite huge but I don't
think uh that is you know uh that can
affect actually so you can see this is
how index works now let's say if I
create multiple index let's say if I'm
trying to find multiple uh you know
Fields so in that case let us see how it
actually impacts
all right so let us now understand how
it works for a compound feed so when you
are trying to uh index uh multiple
Fields let us see how the query
performance does so let us know uh find
uh you know the details of the employees
whose department is police and let's say
the job titles is Sergeant so in that
case I'll basically search for
Department field where the department is
Polish
and put a comma and I've dropped it that
I'm searching for is basically Sergeant
so mention SAR Gent
okay close the brackets and let us now
find the documents
so if you look at it will only display
all the uh details of employees who is
basically job title is Sergeant and
department is police so let us now
understand how it is executing so let us
explain uh click on the explain button
so you could you can see that the
documents it is examining is basically
the all the documents that is present in
the collection that is 32928 now out of
that it is returning 12 to 196. so as
you can see it is a time taking process
it is going through each and every
document now thing is we only have only
around 1300 documents where the
department is polished and the job title
is Sergeant so instead of that what I'll
do is I'll basically index the uh both
Department as well as the job title as
well so let us just create another index
here firstly for Department
create index so let us create another
index for job title
and let us create an index again so as
you can see we have created the index
successfully so let us now try to find
the documents all right it will find
that it will fetch all the documents and
let us now uh
basically uh click on the explain and
see how it does so as you can see now
the documents that is that it examined
now is 1296 which you've seen earlier
that all the details of employees whose
department is Polish and the job title
is Sergeant so after creating an index
it is only searching only those
documents whose department is police and
Sergeant as you can see the actual query
execution time is also reduced
drastically from almost 4 30 to
milliseconds to almost 16 milliseconds
so it'll also vary like if you click
again it will change to six milliseconds
now that it is find the details so it
keeps on changing so index basically
provides the user to efficiently uh
navigate through that data which is
required by them instead of searching
the whole data so now you might be
wondering why we need Advanced uh
technique now let's say if I have a sub
array fields in these documents so in
that case I need to query
those documents quickly right now it
will take more time than single field or
a compound field now that is where we
use Advanced indexing to uh index sub uh
array fields or sub documents
so let us now understand how advanced
indexing works and why we have uh you
know went through all that scenario on
mongodb Compass where we have understood
how indexing works for a single field as
well as compounding field and the need
for advanced indexing now let's say I
have a document of students uh let's say
I have their student ID their name age
courses now for courses field I have an
other additional uh you know array array
section where I am mentioning the course
ID course name and course credits so in
that case we have an array field here
right so in such case we'll use Advanced
indexing now Advanced indexing is
basically just another process where we
are using another technique right so
let's say if I have 20 million such
records right 26 million documents
present in my collection it will take a
lot of time so this is where we need to
use indexing process again so let's say
if you're indexing an array field the
Syntax for that would be
db.collection.create index mention the
array field name that is and the order
so I am creating an index on courses
right uh which is an array field there
so the query would be db.students.create
index courses and mention the order that
is one now you can also further uh you
know index sub document Fields right now
instead of just uh indexing the array
field you can also index the subdocument
field so let's just understand the
syntax here that is
dp.collection.create index field name
dot subdocument field name and the order
now why we are doing this now suppose
that we want to search documents you
know based on the course ID course name
or even the core uh course credits now
since all these fields are part of the
courses subdocument field right which we
will create an index here on all the
fields of this sub document now in this
example I've created an index field on a
subdocument which is course ID similarly
you can also create for course name as
well as the course credit also so the
query is followed as DB dot students
create index courses dot course ID and
I'm mentioning the order as one so once
the index is created we can search for
any of the sub document Fields utilizing
this uh in a query now remember that the
query expression has to follow the order
of the index specified that is either 1
or minus 1 otherwise you will get an
error so in this way we can use uh a
technique which is Advanced indexing in
order to query the array Fields as well
as sub document Fields now in addition
to that we have some other Advanced
indexing techniques which is uh another
three types of indexing techniques in
mongodb which is first one is geospital
index now mongodb uses 2D index and 2D
spear to increase the efficiency of
database queries while dealing with a
geospatial coordinate data next we also
have text index which provides support
to text search queries on string content
so basically text indexes can include
any field whose value is a string or an
array of string elements and finally we
have hashed index now basically hashed
index keep tracks of the entries with
hatches of the values of the index field
which is almost always the underscore ID
field which is created by default in all
the collection now this kind of index is
primarily necessary when you are
sharding data to distribute it evenly
now if you want to learn more about
sharding we have a dedicated video on
that as well so make sure to check that
on our Channel
foreign
guys so in this way you can use uh
Advanced indexing uh to create an index
on you know multi-key compound uh you
know Fields as well so let's say if you
have a document with an array field you
can just create indexing for an array
field creating an index and an array in
turn creates separate index entries for
each of its Fields so it will basically
separate uh create an index to an array
field so it will help you to find the
documents with which are having any
array field values as well so I hope you
understood uh all the techniques and how
we Implement Advanced indexing in
mongodb mongodb you will most likely use
the fine method or command for a variety
of queries now however as your queries
become more complex you will need to
learn more about aggregation in mongodb
which is used to perform various complex
operations so in this tutorial we'll be
covering the fundamentals of creating
aggregate queries in mongodb and how to
use various expressions in mongodb
aggregation and furthermore will
introduce the most important stages of
aggregation pipeline along with examples
of how to apply each one to this
pipeline stages all right firstly let us
understand what is aggregation and
mongodb mongodb process the data records
in the database during an aggregation
operation and returns a single computed
result it actually groups multiple
documents present in a collection
applies an aggregation operation to it
and then provides the user with a single
result now mongodb offers a wide range
of aggregation operations just like many
other database systems in relational
databases as well mongodb being a no SQL
database also provides with the same
functionality this enables you to filter
data as you might with a query as well
as grouping data sorting data into a
particular order or reorganizing for
returning the documents in the
collection now this is just similar to
the SQL wherein we use the group by
clause in our aggregation function with
the help of certain operations like
count average sum minimum and value to
perform complex aggregation operations
in the similar way mongodb aggregation
is also similar to that of the SQL
aggregation method that we follow
so I hope you understood what is
aggregation in mongodb Let Us Now
understand why we use aggregation now
data from different sources is gathered
by an aggregation method which are then
processed to a single outcome now to
perform an aggregate function in a
relational database the database
management system typically extracts
data from multiple rows of the same
table but in a document oriented
database like mongodb the database will
gather information from various
documents in the same collection so it
basically group values from multiple
documents together to a single resultant
value now next one is it fetches a lot
of nested data to perform complex
operations Now when using a database
management system you must run an
operation known as a query right each
time you want to retrieve data from
database however queries only return the
information that is already present in
the database you will frequently need to
carry out another type of operation
which is known as aggregation in order
to analyze your data in order to find
patterns or other information about the
data so if there are if there is a
complex operation that is needed for the
data that is present in documents you
need aggregation and finally it filters
and sort documents and analyze data
changes now uh mongodb being an SQL
nosql database the data model will
frequently change as the data that is
being you know inserting into the
database might change over the time so
in order to analyze this unstructured
data it becomes quite important that you
uh make a proper you know filtration and
sorting of these documents to get a
proper insights for your businesses and
as well as your you know requirements so
in that case aggregation can be quite
useful which simplifies you know the
complexity of the query that you have
written and fetches the data in no time
so these are some of the main reasons on
why we use aggregation
now aggregation uh in mongodb is
performed using uh aggregation pipeline
stages with consists of four different
you know methods the first one is match
next we have group Next we have sort and
finally we have project these four
combinedly are known as aggregation
pipeline stages which perform
aggregation as per the requirement now
firstly when you take a collection and
the first thing you need to is if you
want to match only certain Fields you
know within your documents to perform
aggregation then you can use the match
method next we have the group now just
like the group by clause in SQL you can
use the group uh you know function here
as well in order to group all these
similar or the related uh type of data
in your
you know pres present in your
collections that is the data that is
present in your documents to in order to
retrieve the similar kind of data you
can use the group Next sort again
sorting can be done in any other way
like from ascending order or descending
order next we have the project as we
discussed earlier in a previous tutorial
project is used to uh you know remove
the unnecessary fields that you want in
a result instead and finally after you
know matching all the four uh pipeline
stages then you get the resultant output
so let us understand this uh with an
example wherein will discuss how
aggregation Works in mongodb now as
discussed earlier the firstly the match
condition uh you know specifies only the
related documents that you want to
consider so for example I have a
collection name orders here and I'm
performing uh you know an aggregation
operation here so first I've mentioned
the match for status a so I have like
four documents here if you've seen the
orders like for the four different
customer IDs we have the amount and
status now I want to retrieve only uh
those documents whose status is a so for
that I'm using the match command here so
match command only retrieve the one that
you have specified here which is data
say so we have only three records that
have the status as field and their value
is a so we have sorted initially with
the match command next we want to group
the values in the order of their let's
say IDs and then so if you look at here
we have two similar IDs which is A123
and b212 so what group does is it will
match all the similar related fields
together and produce a result so you can
see the A123 and B21 b212 are separated
into a different groups and finally what
I'm doing is I'm sorting I'm sorting and
I'm applying an operation here with sum
so what it does is it will basically
calculate the total amount here so if
you look at the first ID A123 the amount
is 500 and 250. so the resultant output
would be 750 and finally we have the
customer ID of p212 the amount is just
200. so in this way the aggregation
pipeline Works in a methodology of
wherein it matches the values that is
the similar values from the documents
then you can even group the data that
you want to show in a resultant output
and you can perform various operation uh
using the aggregate functions like some
minimum average with the help of sorting
as well so this is basically how
aggregation Works in mongodb so and
finally as discussed earlier just like
similar to SQL we have the same five or
the main five aggregation operations in
SQL which is the first one is sum it
basically adds up the values of every
documents of a collection next we have
the average which computes the average
value of every document of a collection
next we have minimum or Min Returns the
minimum of all values from the
collection and next we have Max which is
opposite to that of minimum minimum
which Returns the maximum of all values
from within the collection and finally
we have an additional uh you know
operation which is a push operation
since mongodb is non-relational database
we also work on the array of elements so
in order to add the values to an array
in the associated document within a
collection you can use the push
operation as well now this might be a
bit confusing for you guys now so let us
jump into mongodb shell for execution
part where it will perform uh
different operations using the
aggregation pipeline stages and see how
they are getting implemented and also
perform a detailed analysis on the uh
data of the collection that we have and
we will bring out some inferences using
the aggregation operations using various
expressions like some average minimum
and maximum so without any further delay
let us jump into mongodb shell so as you
can see we have opened the mongodb shell
command prompt line so let us just uh
use the command show DBS to find out the
database present so we have different
databases like admin config local and
simply code one we'll use the simply
code one as usual so use
write the database name user B code one
now let us see the collections that are
present in the table so we have the
employee collection again so let us
write the command using the DB dot find
find
so it will retrieve all the values that
are present in this collection so we
have our different fields like employee
ID first name last name email phone
number hiring date job ID salary manager
ID and Department ID so all right let us
now perform the aggregate operations in
a sequential way firstly we look at the
match aggregation uh you know stage
where it will match the related fields
that we want in a resultant set now
let's say if I want to match the
department ID whose all the employers
who belong to the department added let's
say 100 so in that case the following
query would be DB Dot
employee dot mention the aggregate
keyword here which is a must otherwise
it will throw an error when open the
parenthesis and mention the square
brackets and use the dollar symbol to
write the statement for match
put the call in
and open the parenthesis and mention the
department ID
field
which is uh on which we are basically
you know matching the attic watch so
mentioned it again the colon and within
single quotes mentioned the department
ID name so since we have taken as 100
I'm just taking it close the uh flower
brackets
two times and again mention the square
bracket once again and close the
parenthesis all right so this is the uh
basically the query that we have written
here which is DB dot imported Aggregate
and we're using the match aggregation
method here wherein we are matching all
the records of the employees whose
Department ID belongs to 100 so let's
now enter
uh I think there is an error here
so we had a error in the syntax guys uh
so as you can see in the output we can
see only those records of the employees
were in it is showing are the records
whose Department ID is hundred so we
have the employee ID 108 109 110 111 and
112 113 and all of them have their
employee Department IDs sorry or
Department IDs 100. so I hope you
understood this so let us now uh go
through the next stage of aggregation
Pipeline with whereinvale group uh the
values now so for that the following
query would be DB dot employee
dot aggregate
which is the keyword again open the
parenthesis
and mention the double
square brackets open the flower brackets
and use the dollar symbol again write
the group keyword
and open the flower brackets again
and mention the ID here so I'll explain
why we are taking this here again
so firstly let us just write the you
know command and then I'll explain to
you guys that why you are implementing
that so I want to group all the
basically the department IDs right so I
am taking Department ID
so make sure the dollar symbol
so the field name which is the
department ID
close the
flower brackets twice mentioned or a
double bracket square bracket as well
so when you enter uh you can see the
list of all the department IDs that are
present in our collection so we have
various I uh Department IDs like 60 10
30 70 40 110 115 20 98 and so on
so now you might have a doubt that why
we are using the ID field layer now we
are using the group stage to group the
input documents by the specified you
know ID expression which returns a
single document containing the all the
cumulative values of all the ER
Department IDs that we have taken here
so in this above example only the group
stage is specified in the pipeline
whereas the group uses the ID field to
calculate at the value for all the input
documents as a whole so the expression
ID column uh
the dollar symbol Department ID creates
a distinct group on the field Department
name since you don't uh we didn't
calculate any accumulated values in our
document it Returns the distinct values
of Department IDs that are present in
the table or in a document so in this
way you can use the group aggregation
method as well
so this is how you can use the match and
group stages wherein you can combine
both these as well so next let us look
at how to create an aggregation
operation using one of the expression
that we have like count average sum or
minimum now let's say if I want to count
the total employees in a particular
Department in that case I'll basically
use the match statement wherein it will
group all the values of the employees
whose Department IDs in a particular you
know value and then it will count the
total number of employees in that group
so for that the following query would be
DB Dot
employee Dot
aggregate
open the
open the brackets and uh square brackets
as well and then mention the flower back
brackets and then use the dollar match
uh group stage
wherein we are matching uh you know
the department ID let's say Department
ID of 60. so in that case it would be
Department
ID
I have taken the value as 60 mentioned
in the double coach
and close the brackets
put a comma and then basically we are
counting right so I'll use the count
function here
so put the dollar sign
and check the account keyword
and let's say
the statement would be total
employees
in Department
60.
right so
mention the put these close the uh
brackets as well
square brackets
second
so when you press the enter in a
resultant output it states that total
employees and Department 60 is 5. so
similarly you can check for various
other departments as well so let us just
verify if it's showing correctly or not
I'll just copy paste this and let's say
for 100 now I want the total number of
employees present in the department 100
so in that case I'll just mention it
I'll just change the values and let us
now print enter so as you can see in the
resultant set or result in the output
you can see the total number of
employees and Department 100 is 6
wherein we have the total number of
employees in Department six days five so
in this way you can use the various
aggregation stages using the match group
and as well as sort as well and perform
various aggregation operations like Sim
uh some minimum maximum as well
so I think we have covered most of the
concepts that we have discussed in our
inner tutorial so that brings us to the
end of today's session guys I hope you
understood uh what aggregation methods
and how they are used in mongodb so let
us understand what is mongodb
replication now the database replication
is the process of copying data from a
database in one server to a database in
another one ensuring that the same data
is available on more than one mongodb
server now the main purpose of
replication is high availability and
data redundancy now data is kept durable
by having several copies or replicas
stored on physically separate servers
now replication is that process of
generating redundant data in order to
integrate and protect data accessibility
and durability
Now by generating multiple copies of
your data across servers replication
enables you to increase data
availability this is especially helpful
if a server fails or your service is
interrupted or if there are any hardware
failure issues
now if your data is only stored in a
single database any of these events
would make data access impossible so if
there is any breakage or failure of
system or server failure in that case
you need a recovery and backup option
however thanks to replication your
application can remain operational even
if your database server fails while also
providing disaster recovery and backup
options as well so that is what mover DB
replication is all about now why we need
replication in mongodb now there are
various factors that we can take into
account on why we need replication but
these are the main reasons why we need
replication now the first one is
replication provides High availability
of data now as discussed earlier the
main purpose of replication is to
provide High availability and data
redundancy by storing the data in
multiple server rather than one now this
data is available 24x7 to the user even
if there are any issues with the uh you
know server side or any database failure
as well now it also protects from any
single server loss or Hardware failures
and service interruptions so now data
replication is much to keep your data
protected right so it ensures not only
the high availability of data but also
the ease of access especially in the
event of any unexpected errors such as a
system crash Hardware or software based
errors and Etc and finally replication
ensures that data is always available to
every client now no matter the problem
is the report replication it does is it
basically shifts the data into multiple
uh servers or multiple locations wherein
the data can be available in each of any
server that is present in the database
rather than only a single server side
where the data is stored so let us now
understand how does replication work in
mongodb now this diagram of mongodb
replication is shown in the uh image
which I guess you guys are visible where
a client application always communicates
is the primary node and the primary node
replicates the data to the multiple
second denotes here so we have a client
application wherein the data that is
being read and write operations are
taking place from mongodb server and the
driver as well and we have a primary
server here which basically does only
write operation right and rate operation
both as well and then from there it
creates a replication of the same
database server into a secondary server
now when I talk about server here we
have different nodes now replication you
know is done through a replica replica
set process which in simple words it's a
group of mongodb process to keep the
same data across different servers now
we'll be discussing what replicate set
is in a while so but a replicates it
basically must have certain number of
nodes now as you can see in the right
side of the image we have various
multiple nodes that is servers now in
that we have we need at least one
primary server in order to perform
replication on the data that is present
in a database the rest all can be
secondary data now a replica set must
have three nodes at least now one of
them must be primary and the rest
secondary ones our application structure
can have up to almost 50 nodes so let us
now understand what is replicated that
we have been talking about now mongodb
manages replication using replica sets
which are collection of related mongodb
nodes now a replica set requires a
minimum of basically three mongodb nodes
that I have discussed earlier one of
which should be considered as the
primary node that receives all the right
operations and on the other hand the the
rest of the remaining ones are
considered as the secondary nodes which
will replicate the data from the primary
node and if in case if there is a
failure at any level of uh you know node
structure or if there is any possibility
of a field known as recovered it
actually works as a secondary node again
but not as a primary node so if you look
at this diagram again here now basically
we have an application and then we have
a primary node here right now the
primary uh node is the member in which
the replica set receives write and read
operations but read operations can be
pointed out to secondary notes as well
which changing are the configuration at
the moment to perform the query besides
the replica Set uh we can have only one
uh primary node at most as discussed
earlier and then the replication is done
on the secondary node so the secondary
uh node is where the data is replicated
to maintain a copy a replica set can
have one or more secondary notes Here
guys so basically the clients cannot
write data to secondary once only they
can read from them that is what a
replicate set is all about so let us
just quickly recap what we have covered
here now to perform this we need a
minimum of three nodes which is required
and in this operation of replication
mongodb assumes one word as one one of
the replicates it as a primary node and
the remaining as the secondary node so
from within the primary node data data
gets replicated to secondary node and
again in case of any failure or any
system error the new primary nodes get
elected in case there is an automatic
maintenance or failover now if you can
see in the second diagram we have a hard
symbol here guys which is basically
known as heartbeat mechanism so each
node is connected to all the other and a
heartbeat mechanism is in place to call
any other node so the heartbeat has a
configurable time for pinging the nodes
and the default is 10 seconds so if all
the notes respond with an acknowledge to
the heartbeat the cluster or the server
the the nodes where the the nodes are
present it continues to work and if one
of the nodes crashes the primary node
for example an election takes place
involving the remaining nodes and when a
second it does a second you know doesn't
receive a response to the heartbeats up
to the configure timeout it calls for an
election so this takes place until the
primary node which has been uh failed is
recovered so next let us discuss what
are some of the benefits of replication
now as discussed earlier replication
helps in disaster recovery and backup of
data it basically improves application
reliability Now by spreading your data
across multiple missions you can ensure
that your applications data continues to
be available even in the event of any
hardware failure on any given machine or
server in the replication group it also
uh the replication also minimizes
downtime for maintenance now since we
are you know transferring or locating
our data into various multiple servers
it basically minimizes the downtime for
maintenance also and we can also achieve
load balancing as well using replication
we know that mongodb works on a lot of
unstructured data and it keeps on piling
up on and on so if let's say if a user
is working on one of the database and
which is having a particular server to
its name while a lot of people also can
work on the same server so that can
cause you know a breakage of failure
sometimes so so in order to achieve that
load balance you know to handle number
of people and number of people that are
working on the same database we can
basically replicate the data that is
present in our database to different
servers and from which we can eventually
achieve load balancing now on the other
side we have certain limitations as well
with the usage of replication also some
of them are higher costs and time
constraints now maintaining consistent
data across you know disparate or
various locations option taxing in terms
of resources now if you maintain
duplicates of the same data in various
locations and distributed database
systems which results in great greater
storage as well as processing costs as
well which ultimately results in time
constraints while executing and handling
the duplication process which needs
committed time from an in-house team or
a people that are working on that
database to ensure that the copy data is
consistent with the source data that is
all the data that is being copied from
the primary node is actually same as
that is being copied into the secondary
node and finally redundant data is being
stored in the secondary uh server or
secondary node right so it basically
takes more space and server processing
is also required which takes a lot of
time so those were some of the
limitations or you can say disadvantages
of a replication in mongodb and that
brings us to the end of today's session
guys uh so let's just quickly recap what
we have discussed in the uh today's
session now mongodb replication is one
of an important process which makes data
available across multiple data servers
so instead of just storing our data at a
one particular site you can basically
shift it to across multiple data storage
locations now data redundancy and
availability and load balancing are one
of the important factors that we've
discussed in replication which are
important you know for maintaining such
a huge database you know data that is
being constantly changing and ever
evolving mongodb also supports your
application with the help of replica
sets as discussed replica sets are
basically a combination of various
mongodb instances each having a single
primary node and multiple secondary node
now this process is done on a keyword
that is heartbeat mechanism which is a
method of finding out the current state
of the mongodb node in a replica set now
the heartbeat signal basically matches
or verifies whether the data is being
generated in the primary node and it is
further uh displacing into this
secondary node so replicate set
selection is used to find out which
mongodb node should be the primary node
and finally we talk about scalability
performance and high availability which
are the Paramount factors in a mongodb
replication now when I talk about
scalability guys scalability as the data
volume increases the complexity of
accessing data and working with data
also increases so the replication in
place multiple data copies are available
users to not only increase their data
but also recover any previous version in
case of any errors or failure
performance is also very important when
you are replicating certain data now
when data which is available across
multiple servers it not it not only
makes accessing data easier but makes
recovering from unexpected and sudden
failures much easier so replication
basically ensures data availability and
security all the time so with
replication in place there's no need to
worry about data failures your data is
you know safely stored in other
locations so in situations where your
primary source of data fails you can
easily access the same up-to-date data
from a secondary Reserve or the data
that is stored in secondary server which
highly promotes data availability and
which is another in today's session
we'll be going through mongodb sharding
concept and we'll understand how it is
implemented the use of it and how
exactly it is performed and will finally
understand the advantages of starting in
mongodb so without any further Ado let's
get started with today's topic
so firstly what is starting in mongodb
now sharding is a method for
Distributing a single data across
multiple databases which can then be
stored on multiple machines this allows
for large data sets to be split into
smaller chunks and stored into multiple
data nodes increasing the total storage
capacity of the system
so for example let's say I have a
database which has you know 2 million
users uh that are running on my database
frequently so the single machine has a
capacity to only uh hold two million
records in that now for instance my
business is growing and with the ever
increasing demand of data the data is
being piled up in in more uh you know
numbers now for example the 2 million
has been raised into 3 million and in
that case the operations on that
database can be quite difficult because
there is a huge traffic of data that can
be uh you know applied on that database
for in that case I can basically split
the data database into two different you
know instances where I can make two
machines or I can basically store the
data into different servers wherein I
can have two different capacities now
let's say I have divided the 2 million
to 1 million and 1 million now I further
can have a total capacity of total 4
million that is 2 million and 2 million
in each database so this is what a
sharding is based upon sharding
basically distributes the process and
stores a single data set into multiple
databases
now the purpose of any database
distribution is to enhance the
scalability of the applications uh and
sharding is an excellent way to keep the
data safe across different resources in
mongodb database sharing is an
achievable by breaking down big data
sets into simple subdivided data sets
across multiple instances now this
single database cannot handle a database
with large data sets right as it
requires large storage and bulk query
operations can use most of the CPU
Cycles which slows down the processing
of the system for six scenarios we need
more powerful system
so now one approach is to add more
capacity to single server such as adding
more memory and processing units or
adding RAM on on the single server then
it is basically known as scaling now we
can do scaling in two ways first one is
we have vertical scaling vertical
scaling basically refers to adding more
resources for example adding a new CPU
or increasing the Ram or or instead
adding a new disk size to your server
based on your demand and next you also
have horizontal scaling horizontal
scaling involves adding more and more
processing units of physical machines to
your server or databases
so it is basically used to divide a
large data set across multiple systems
and serve a data application to query
data from multiple servers this approach
is basically called as horizontal
scaling and mongodb handles horizontal
scaling through sharding thing now let
us now understand why we exactly need
mammodb sharding guys now we learned
that in our previous uh tutorial about
replication wherein we learned that
replica sets gave us the ability to hold
data in multiple databases and thus
given as a certain level of fault
tolerance and data duration and however
this approach has certain limitations as
previously mentioned guys all right
operations in replication go to the
primary nodes as you can see here we
have the primary node here it is going
to be uh secondary node and all the
right operations are basically done on
this primary node and all the read
operations are basically processed to
the secondary node which makes it the uh
you know crucial thing of any system
right the this means that if the system
grows this primary node will be overused
so in that case
eventually it will be limited with
Hardware limitations like Ram number of
CPUs and disks and Etc
so in that case it it is quite difficult
you know that a database can be of
efficient way to uh you know address the
demand or process the data within the
database so that is where mongodb
sharding comes into picture
now
since it is a limitation of uh
replication that is where as I said
sharding comes into play when there is
when database must struggle to handle
more and more data and the query traffic
increases in that case you need to
distribute the data into simpler or uh
secondary multiple machines now another
reason is mongodb instance is unable to
manage right operations as I said
earlier uh the database
in replication you know you're basically
copying or duplicating the data from one
uh mongodb database into another in that
case it becomes difficult for one single
database to manage all the right
operations right so in that case we need
sharding
next memory cannot be outsized enough in
case your La if your data set is large
for example if the Earth the database is
working on large data large data sets in
that case memory cannot be you know over
uh settled or you can incorporate a
memory you know if the data data set is
too large
and finally which also impacts the
database maintenance also and vertical
scaling is nowadays too costly and in
that case mongodb sharding comes into
picture
so that those were some of the reasons
why we need mongodb sharding so let us
now move ahead and let us understand how
mongodb sharding works now before
mongodb sharding uh the working of
mongodb starting we need to understand
the mongodb starting architecture now
implementing the concept of sharding can
be done with the use of clusters so when
I say about clusters sharding clusters
are basically the combination of
multiple shots Mongoose processes and
configuration servers so if you look
into this image we basically have an app
server wherein we have various routers
and we have a mongodb mongoose instance
of mongodb mongos process and we also
have configuration server so config
servers which are basically the replica
sets and we have different charts where
we are basically trying to you know
breakdown uh a single huge uh database
into further uh you know simpler pieces
now this is done with the help of a
sharing key now on charting a mongodb
data set a short key is automatically
created by default the short key
basically can be in form of an indexed
field or index compound field that will
be used to distribute that data among
these charts generally The Shard key is
used to distribute mongodb collections
document across all the shots where the
key consists of a single field or
multiple fields in every document
so that brings us to the main part which
is how mongodb shatting works now now
mongodb sharding works by creating a
cluster of all these mongodb instances
consisting of at least three servers
which we'll be discussing in a while so
the shared cluster or the mongodb
sharding cluster consists of three main
components which is basically shot
mongos and config servers now when I
talk about chart A Shard is basically a
single mongodb instance that holds a
subset of the sharded data shards can be
deployed as a replica set to increase
availability and provide redundancy now
the combination of multiple charts
creates a complete data set for example
if you are trying to break down or let's
say a 5tb data set which can be broken
down further
into four shots each combining of 100 GB
of data from the original data set so
that is what A Shard is all about now
next we have mongos Mongoose acts as a
query router providing a stable
interface between the application and
the sharded cluster the this mongodb
instance is responsible for routing the
client's request to the correct shot and
finally we have the config servers
configuration servers basically restore
the data and the configuration settings
for the whole cluster so if you look at
it look at this diagram we have a router
which is having a mongodb instance and
we have configuration servers wherein we
have primary secondary servers in that
and also we have shards where we are
basically dividing again into primary
and secondary so the application
communicates with the routers which is
basically the mongos about the query to
be executed now the Mongoose instance
consults the config servers to check
which chart contains the required data
set to send the query to that chart and
finally the result of this query will be
returned to the application
so you need to understand that it's
important to remember that the config
servers also work as a replica sets here
that is why we have primary and
secondary uh you know notes here as well
so this is how basically uh how mongodb
sharding works now the idea is to have
basically multiple replica sets with
multiple primaries that will divide data
and load it among themselves and each of
these replica sets is basically called A
Shard but multiple shards are not enough
to achieve the proper functionality of
this kind of system
so and that brings us to the final
component or final uh you know thing to
our session which is basically the
advantages of sharding
so in database sharding the gives a lot
of advantages now one of them is
increased storage capacity so when data
gets distributed across the shards in
the cluster each chart contains a subset
of the total data in the cluster and on
increasing the data volume the
additional shards grow which leads to
expanding the cluster storage capacity
sharding also increases the read and
write throughput in the database also
guys now in mongodb the read and write
workloads are easily distributed across
the shards in the sharded cluster it
allows each chart to process a subset of
the cluster operation so both the read
and write performance can be directly
scaled horizontally across the cluster
by increasing the shared count and which
again ultimately results in high
availability of data now with an
Uncharted database an outage in one
database chart has a caliber to their
you know impact the entire application
and lose losing its functionality or
even completely stop it however with a
sharded database if there is complete
unavailability of one or more sharp
replicas only a few parts of the
application or the website which is
available to some users however the
other shots continue their operation
without any concern
and finally shading facility facilitates
horizontal scaling now one more reason
uh you know developers love database
sharding is that it facilitates
horizontal scaling which also means
scaling out your databases this means it
allows you to have parallel backends and
carrier tasks simultaneously without no
width no hassle whether the focus is on
writing or reading operations scaling
out can add big advantage to enhance the
performance and also eliminate
complexities so these were some of the
main advantages of sharding guys so that
brings us to the end of today's session
now you might wonder how sharding and
replication are different from each
other so whenever you're thinking about
sharding or replication you need to
think in the context of you know the
right and the update operations that
you're performing on your database so if
you don't need to scale right or write
processes then applique then replication
as it's fairly simple is a good choice
for you on the other hand let's say you
know if your workload is mostly on right
operation uh most of the times then at
some point you'll hit a uh you know uh
write operation that is compulsory
needed for you in any case right so if
write request comes
um comes then basically blocks
other write request right so these are
all the write request blocks until the
first request will be done so if you
want to scale this right operations and
want to paralyze then in your in in such
case you need to implement sharding what
are relationships in mongodb the mongodb
relationships are the representation on
how different documents present in a
collection are collected logically to
each other database 4db relationships
helps in various different factors right
for example it relationships enforce
data integrated in religion and
databases and it also establishes
between documents which can help refine
the database structure as per your
requirement now we know that mongodb is
a low SQL database and has a lot of
unstructured data so in order to
properly confine all the documents into
a proper format and refining them into a
proper structure is quite beneficial not
just in terms of saving the data but it
also affects the performance and makes
execution time also shorter and finally
it basically links important entities in
the database so that is what
relationship and mongodb is now there
are different types of normative
relationship here guys we have embedded
and reference method so data
relationship can be achieved through
these methods wherein embedded documents
a relationship between data is by
storing related data into a single
document structure now let's say if I
have a collection I'll have two
different documents now as the word
suggests which is embedded I am
basically storing these two different
documents into a single document
structure which is known as embedded a
document relationship and similarly we
have a document referenced method or
simply reference method which is used to
store the relationship between data by
including any links or references from
one document to another
now we'll understand this with an
example here now if you consider this
Emirate model uh you know collection
which I have here let's say I have uh
you know a details of a person whose
name is Prada whose ID is double one
eight zero two five his contact details
are there his phone number is email
address now this is basically one
document right now similarly I have
another document wherein I'm having his
great details that is his subject which
is cs203 and the score that is the grade
that they have achieved is B now instead
of having two different uh documents in
the collection and basically merging
them that is I'm embedding both of these
into a single document so this is what
embedded model does it basically
combines two or two uh documents into a
single document structure
and similarly I have reference model the
reference model basically links two or
more documents right now let's say I
have again a student collection here
which is uh of Rohan whose uh contact
details his email ID phone number and
grade MP displayed here so let's say I
have
uh let's open a collection
uh in that I have three different
documents which is student contact
details and grade now instead of having
three separate uh three separate
documents I can simply combine these or
I can link uh with the help of user ID I
can basically come by the contact
details as well as the grade into a
single document so this is how reference
model works that is by referencing or
linking to our Word documents into a
single document structure so that was
all about reference model and that is
main difference between Emirate and
reference
well we have these two Emirate and
document reference relationships and
these can be achieved by three different
methods that is we can have one-to-one
relationship one to many relationships
and in document reference relationship
can be achieved through many too many
relationships now let us now understand
what exactly these are all right so what
do a relationship basically if you have
any one field it can only have one value
in such case it will consider as one to
one relationship between any data that
is present in the document and if you
consider one to many otherwise the name
suggests one two very so when one field
has multiple relationship between the
data in between documents that is stored
in the collection of a database in that
case in such case one to many
relationship model can be used
and similarly we have many too many now
let's say I have uh
you know three uh different you know
document structures wherein I have two
or more entities within a document are
having let's say a array of uh details
present in a single collection or in a
document so it can have multiple
relationships right so in in that case
we need to use many to many I hope this
is clearly understood uh we'll get into
detail by uh each of them will consider
each of the relationship model and
understand how it is different from each
other with an example now
so firstly we have the one-to-one
relationship guys now whatever
relationships are created by linking two
documents from different collection
using a shared key that is sharing the
object ID of one collection to the other
uh which is a property of the same value
now also the best way to create this
relationship is to have the child
collection query which is the key value
of the first collection now object IDs
which basically are created by defaulted
mongodb are commonly used to make this
connection although it can be of any
other type now let's say I have another
example here which says that I have a
user's collection which has ID by
default name John and age is 40. and I
have address collection as well which
has ID which is by default again and the
address details like street name master
street number I'm having 14 21.0 city as
neuron the one what one-to-one
relationship does is it links to
different documents right so in order to
combine these these two I need a a
common property or a common key that is
done by using the object ID here so if
you look at the result the resultant set
of the document has been combinedly
showcasing the details of the user as
well as its address so you can clearly
see that we have the object ID the
details first here next we have the name
John 840 address again in address we are
basically documenting or adding the data
of the address in the same document
itself so this is one-to-one
relationship
let us now move ahead and understand
what is one to very relationship
so one too many relationship is another
relational model we use which is created
by linking a document in one collection
to multiple documents in other
collection so let's say I have a
without an example of a collection here
now this is basically widely used I
don't know how to increase is to use
increasingly and you know where there
are more array values within a table so
in such case you can you can use one to
very relationship now for example I have
a authors collection which says uh the
name of the author is JK Rowling and we
have two different books and for that we
have object IDs as well so in other
collection we have the details of the
books now clearly which is ID agree a
name of the book is philosopher stone
and next we have another book collection
uh the data that is of chambers of
secret now in order to combine this you
know one to value is basically with the
reference of author collection are
basically correcting uh you know two
different book collection into a single
document so we have multiple documents
in the books collection right and we
have a single author collection now I'm
basically clocking these two are
creating a link between these two
collection and I'm creating a single
document so if you look at the result
resultant set I have the name of the
author that is JK Rowling and the books
are there IDs and the details of their
books that is the name that is
Philosopher's Stone and Chambers of
secret so in this way you can also use
one to many relationship model in order
to properly structure your data based on
the requirement
and similarly we also have made too many
relationship here guys but I'm not going
to discuss it let us know in the comment
section below uh and let us know what
can be a good example of buried to many
relationships and that brings us to the
end of today's session guys now while
embedded a data type Emirate document
model is ideal for one to one and one to
manage relationship and referenced uh
data document model is ideal for many to
many relationship now
denormalization which is embedded
whereas globalization is the name given
to reference relationships now
establishing a good relationship between
documents can Aid in the refinement of
the database structure as we discussed
earlier which can overall impact uh can
impact the overall performance of the
database
reduce the execution time in the
database as well
so I hope right so what is grid Fs in
mongodb Grid FS is one of the powerful
specifications of mongodb that helps to
store and retrieve large-scale files so
it is a specification for storing and
receiving files larger than 16 MB limit
of based on documents now these files
can be structured or unstructured and
they include documents audio files
images recorded video clips binary files
Etc now gridface is similar to a file
system for the storage of files but
mongodb collections are used for storage
of data and files using refers which has
powerful features to store the files of
any format including files that are even
more than 16 MB in size So In classical
implementation there is a file storage
system of 16 MB but mongodb gridfs can
store and retrieve files Beyond this
limit too
now mongodb grid Affairs features allow
for the storage of large files as we
discussed earlier so in order to store
very large files it is not necessary to
load the entire file into RAM instead
chunks of the files are streamed to the
database so these files can be again of
any format it can be an audio pdf movie
and then they are converted into smaller
chunks and they are streamed into the
database so each chunk is limited to 255
KB in size this means that the last
chunk is normally either equal to or
less than 255 KB so it is the checks are
partitioned into smaller 255 KB files
and when you read from grade FS the
driver reassembles all the chunks as per
the user's requirement when they are
needed this means that you can read
sections of a file as per your query
range such as let's say listening to a
segment of an audio file audio trying to
fetching a particular section of a image
file
now because as discussed earlier files
are separated into smaller parts it is
easier to access you know specific areas
of a file which saves memory tasks such
as loading the whole file
now let us now understand why we use
grid Fs in mongodb
foreign so as discussed earlier in
mongodb we use great FS for storing
files which is which are having you know
size larger than 16 MB so in some
situations storing large files may be
more efficient in a mongodb database
than on a system level file system and
that is a reason we have uh some reasons
right a particular you know significance
of using gridf as one such reason is if
your file system limits the number of
files in the current directory in the
 database you can use grid FS to
store as many as files that are needed
now the second reason is when you want
to access information from portions of
large files without having to load the
files into the memory that is without
calling the whole uh you know data into
the ram you can use grid FS to recall
sections only of particular uh you know
specific sections of files without
reading the entire file into the memory
and finally if you want to store and
sync files and meta data across
distributed system so when you want to
keep your files and the data
automatically synced and deployed across
a number of systems and Facilities you
can basically use grid FS so mongodb can
distribute files and their metadata
automatically to a number of mongodb
instances in the database
so these are some of the reasons on why
we use data grade FSN mongodb
so let us now move ahead and
and understand how exactly you know
grade FX Works in mongodb now grid FS
stores files into two collection now
these two collections are basically
known as chunks and files chunks
basically stores the binary chunks and
whereas the file store the files
metadata so if you look at this diagram
which we have uh in our presentation
that you are looking at we have let's
say a large file it can be an audio it
can be a video file or anything and
let's say we have we are dividing we are
using grid Fs in order to uh you know
convert into a chunk of files now when
you are basically converting into a
chunk of file it basically converts into
file metadata and the smaller segments
of data which we call as chunks so we
have fs.files collection
fs.chunks collection so basically gridfx
stores files in two collections right
now
it places the collection in a common
bucket so you can see we have FS bucket
which comprises of FS dot files and Fs
dot collection so it places the
collection in a common bucket by
prefixing each with the bucket name so
by default grade FS uses to collection
as you can see which is fs.files and Fs
dot collection you can choose a
different bucket name as well as create
multiple buckets in a single database
now the full collection name which
includes a bucket name is subjected to
your requirement and your and the need
of the uh
file that you're working on
so let us now understand what is grid FS
chunks collection now the each document
in the check collection represents a
distinct chunk of a file which is a a
smaller segment of the initial or the
original file
which represents a distinct chunk of a
file as represented in Grid FX so the
syntax office I wouldn't say it is uh it
has a syntax uh the basically it stores
the data in a format of ID files ID in
and data so basically a document from
the chunk collection contains these
following Fields now the chunk ID it is
basically the unique object ID of the
chunk now just like how when we store a
data it automatically creates a default
ID number mongodb database similar for
grade FS also we have an ID that is
being automatically generated next we
have the chunks.files ID now this is
basically the ID of the parent document
as specified in the files document next
we have in now chunks.n basically is a
sequence number of the chunk that is
being you know stored into the
collection now grid FS numbers have
chunk numbers starting with 0 and so on
and finally we have 10 dot data it is
basically
we know the data that it gives a
different serial number to the data that
we have inserted into our based on
document
next we have the grid FS chunks
collection
foreign
collection right now we have discussed
what is you know chunk collection now
next we have the files collection now
each document in the file correct
represents a file in a grid reference
and similarly just like the chunk
collection we also have you know a
format and different fields uh you know
when we try to store uh collection grid
FS you know collections in our database
so some of the fields that are we that
are present in the collection are ID
length chunk size uploaded file name
content type aliases and metadata so
documents in the file collection contain
uh these following Fields now for
example the ID again it is the unique
identifier for this document and the ID
of the data type chooses for the
original document next we have the
length which is basically the size of
the document in bytes next we have the
chunk size which is basically the size
of each Chunk in bytes now basically
grade FS divides the document into chunk
size of uh you know as discussed earlier
it is default 255 KB each next we also
have upload date which is the date the
document was first stored by the grid
refers and next we have the content type
it is basically uh the type of you know
file that you're basically adding to uh
you know database to store information
related to the type of data phase files
and we also have optional uh field like
La asses and we also finally have
metadata which is an optional field
which may be of any data type and can
hold any additional information you want
to store
so I hope you understood what is grid
Affairs and what how it actually
performs what are chunks and how it is
dividing into sub you know segments like
you know chunks and files so let us now
get into the direct execution part and
see how it gets executed
now now other than the theory of what uh
you know grade fsues it is also
important to understand how we can use
grid FS to store large files and we have
to uh remember that as the syntax is an
important aspect of executing the
greater facility mongodb so the one
thing that you have to remember is uh in
order to query or to insert a file into
grid FS it is not executed through
mongodb shell guys but it instead of uh
you can use you know windows or Linux or
Mac command prompt now before doing that
also you need to basically download some
you know mongodb database tools uh which
I'll be showing now so if you are using
Windows just uh go to Google and type
mongodb
database tools all right
now when you scroll down a bit you'll
have this you know download mongodb
command line database tools click on
that
now after clicking that you will be you
know redirected to another page which is
basically the mongodb database tool
documentation which will basically show
everything about uh you know various
database tools that are available so on
the left side you can see various
database tools like mongodum store
based on Dom Bongo import export and so
on now we are concerned with files
which is the database tool which we are
going to use in order to store you know
data through uh you know greater fills
so just click on that and if you want to
just go and understand what file
says you can just read it a bit uh so
just click on installation here it will
redirect to the installation page now
you have three options for Linux Mac OS
Windows click on installing the database
tools on Windows and uh
so it will basically tell you what all
to do here installation process it can
be installed with an MSI installer or
download as a zip archive select the
tabular depending on a desired
installation method so we'll be
basically using the MSI installer only
so open the mobile DB download Center
here
so I've already downloaded it on my
system so I'm just basically showing you
again what uh on how you can install
this click on download it's basically it
shows the version again just install the
latest version platform as Windows and
the package is a zip folder click on
download it will take some time based
upon your you know internet speed it
will just take some time so wait for it
now once you are done just extract the
file
now as you can see we have a folder
which is a mongodb database tools and
inside that you have a folder named bin
open on that now as you can see we have
the list of all databases that we have
why not downloaded successfully now we
are only concerned with mongodb files
right so just copy paste this and now
what you have to do is go to the C drive
where mongodb is installed it is
basically in program files click on
program files search for mongodb
click on server 6.0 and you will find
the bin folder click on that and just
basically paste the whole folder or the
 files here so as you can see I've
already paid uh you know copy pasted the
same in my uh Bin folder here so just
click on that and again you'll be
redirected to bin here click on that
again so you can see we have the list of
all the uh database tools that we have
installed on our system so this is
basically the location where you have to
uh you know copy uh the entire file so
otherwise it will throw an error right
so we have mongod file
successfully installed here let us now
uh try to understand how to insert a
file you know with a simple example so
you can see I have uh you know a PNG
file which is an image which is uh
document one we also have a video file
which is mp4 file which is mongodb
replication it says right so let us now
uh try to insert into uh
our database for that just click on
write right click in the same folder you
will find open in terminal click on that
so it will open the windows partial
this is where you have to write the
command prompt line all right so the
above syntax the syntax that you have to
write for this is basically by using the
put keyword which I'll be showing you
now
so we'll be just experimenting with one
simple example that F10 with a simple
image file that we are going to insert
now uh as you can see we don't have any
specific collection for grid FS files
but as we know mongodb has this feature
of creating new collection when we
insert a document into a non-existing
collection so the following query for
inserting a file in Grid FS unlike the
insert operation where we'll insert file
through shell right here we'll use
the again the window partial terminal
now the query to insert uh data
into our database is mention the
files
 files is the keyword and after
that put mention the file name now the
file name that we have taken is document
one right so mention document one dot
and this file type which is of jpg
so the above carries basically this
query is a standard format for inserting
any file into great effects We have
basically navigate the terminal to the
location where files which is a
database Tool uh is being saved so our
query begins with the keyword which is
 files followed by the storage
option which is put keyword and it
specifies the database where the file is
to be stored and here our database name
is name is generally named as grid FS
only and at the moment we don't have any
database with such name but it will be
created so let's just execute click on
enter
all right it is throwing an error
so as you can see it says we have an
error here it says the command
phase was not found but does exist in
the current location Windows partial
does not load commands from the current
location
instead type okay now instead of typing
 files let's just copy this and see
if it is working or not
longer files again mention the keyword
put
and mention the document also
I'm in the document name that we are
trying to insert which is document1 dot
jpg
all right let us now click on enter
I hope it should work now
not sure
so I'm not sure why it is uh throwing an
error guys so let's just take another
example we also have mongodb one which
is I've been a JPG file let us try to
add that
now basically if you want to insert data
you have to store the files in this bin
folder only otherwise it will throw an
error so make sure you keep an eye on
this because uh you know adding huge
amounts of data can take a lot of time
so if you are trying to insert data
which is not specifically in this folder
then it will basically throw an error so
make sure you keep an uh an eye on that
so let's just uh try to add another
folder
so another file
dot uh so the keyword is dot under slash
 files put
the file name as mongodb one dot jpg and
semicolon
so I'll click on enter well all right as
you can see in the status it is
connected to mongodb localhost and it
has added grid file mongodb one and I
think it is successful now so let's just
go to uh you know mongodb shell now and
let us see whether or not it is created
so just
let's just go to uh let's open mongodb
shell
so as you can see the shell has started
so now in order to find uh whether or
not the grid FS file is created or not
you have to use the
db.fs.chunks DOT fine command so we can
see all the chunks present in the FX
collection uh by using this command so
let's just try to find it so the command
is DB dot FS Dot
files.find
so click on that so as you can see it is
retrieving the ID Len chunk size upload
date file name and the metadata which we
have discussed in the earlier I know in
the presentation slide on what are the
different fields that we get so we can
also see uh the chunks present in the
fs.collection related to the stored file
with the following code using the
document ID in this which is this this
object ID right so I'm going to use this
and try to find how many number of
chunks that it has created for this
mongodb1.jpg file so the command the
query is db.fs dot chunks dot find
and inside that open the flower packets
and mention the files ID field
which which you are trying to find
okay mentioned colon
and mention this uh you know
object array that has created which is
639 and so on this I just copy paste
that and copy it here
and mention make sure it is on single
quotes
all right let us just close the brackets
and the flower brackets as well
okay there is an error sorry I just put
another square bracket
so I'm not sure why it is showing but uh
in in most of the cases the query will
return the number of documents that is
the whole uh you know mongodb1.jpg file
was divided into how many chunks of data
like for example 20 30 and so on so in
this way you can use grid FS to store
large amounts of files which are more
than 16 MB in size in your mongodb
database now just to cross verify uh go
to mongodb Compass and see how the data
in the uh database has been created so
you can see mongodb Compass we have a
test database that is created and we
have the fs dot chunks Dot and Fs dot
files which basically stores the
appropriate information of the uh date
the data that we have created in our
database right so you can see in FS dot
chunks we have ID files ID and 0 which
basically uh you know stores the data in
sequential manner like starting from 0 1
2 3 and so on and next in FS dot files
we also have ID length chunk size upload
date file name and metadata
so that was pretty much all about grid
FSN mongodb I guess we have covered
almost all the concepts now grid FS is
basically a gift for developers who
wants to store huge files in mongodb so
if you are someone who is trying to uh
you know store data of audio files image
files or videos files features of more
than 16 MB which is the threshold value
of mongodb which is acceptable rate on
upper which only you can use grid
Affairs so in that case grid FS storage
system allows developers to store big
files and retrieve only certain amount
of those files whenever needed and as a
result grid FS is an outstanding mongodb
features that can be used with variety
of application which makes it an
extremely useful tool for modern
applications like a nosql database like
mongodb firstly let us understand what
is mongodb mapreduce map reduce function
is widely used to access large data set
into a handful of aggregated results and
mapreduce command is used to execute
this function now as a result of this
the data is independently mapped and
reduced in different spaces before being
combined in the function and saved to
the specified new collection this bar
produce function was designed to work
with large data sets only you can
perform aggregation operations like Max
sum and average
on data using mapreduce which is similar
to that of group by nsql so it works
independently and in parallel with data
aggregation
now let us understand what are the key
parameters in map reduce mongodb
provides a mapreduce feature for
aggregation purpose now generally there
are two phases of mapreduce in the first
phase each document is processed and
emits common and redundant part of the
document to pass a unique record for the
next phase which is the map function
next we have the reduce function in this
second phase all the unique paths get
together and aggregate to produce a
single result and finally we have the
query in this we'll pass the query to
filter the result set so with the help
of mapreduce user can perform like
sorting filtering and document
modification
so let us now understand the syntax of
mapreduce
foreign
the syntax is followed as DB dot
collection dot not produce and within
the parenthesis mention the keyword
function and again open the square
flower brackets and mention the keyword
Emit and as we already discussed that
mapreduce works on the key value pair so
mentioned the key as well as the value
that you want to uh you know perform
aggregation on the data and then we have
function again we have to mention the
key and values this is basically the
reduce operation this is the reduce
function we are going to perform here
and then mention the return keyword and
the reduce function that you are going
to perform it can be you know any
aggregation uh you know process unit can
be average sum or maximum and inside
that we have uh certain keywords like
out query sort and limit so basically if
I look if you look at the first part
here the collection name it is basically
defined as the retrieved documents from
The Collection by using the map reduce
command so we can process large volumes
of data use this map reduce method in
mongodb so next we have the map reduce
keyword it is basically a data
processing technique which is used for
large data and useful aggregated results
of large data in mongodb and next we
have this first part is the map function
guys and next we have the reduce
function in this you will get a
clear-cut idea on when we get to the
execution part so just have an idea on
what exactly we are doing here so next
we have the out keyword here out is
basically specifies the that result
location of the map that is operation in
mongodb and we can set output as a
primary member and on the second
remember we can only set an you know
output for this next we have query query
defines the as the selection of
selection criteria of a document in
mongodb
so you are basically telling uh the uh
you know operation basically on the you
are filtering the data on which you want
to perform aggregation and next we have
an optional uh you know commands like
sort and limit as you know sort is used
to sort the documents from collection
this option is mainly useful for
optimization and also next we have limit
limit is a specified method that limits
the total number of documents in the
resultant output so I hope you
understood the basic syntax of map
reduce model
so let us now go ahead and understand
how does mongodb map reduce works now
every input document in the map reduce
operation gets the map phase treatment
from mongodb that is documents in the
collection that match the query
condition so key value pairs are output
by the mapping function now this map
function is used to group all the data
based on the key value and next we have
the reduce function reduce function is
used to perform operations on the map
data so that data independently is
mapped and reduced in different spaces
and then combined together in the
function and the result will save to the
specified new collection so the reduce
phase which gathers and condenses the
aggregated data is used by mongodb for
keys that have multiple values and the
outcomes
are then kept by mongodb in a collection
so in a nutshell if I have to tell that
basically you have to mention the
mapping function first you have to
Define mapping function next you have to
define the reduce function to further
condense or process the aggregation
result now the output of the reduction
reduce function could opt optionally go
through a finalize uh you know function
wherein you are performing the complete
you know map reduce function
so let us just understand this with a
simple example here
so let's say I have certain collections
uh named as orders as you can see on the
left side we have four different orders
having customer ID amount status so we
have uh let's say I think we have two
different uh unique customer IDs which
is A123 and b212 now I'm basically
querying this based on the status that
is a and
d right so it is querying and it is
filtering the records based on this so
you can see A123
amount 500 status a next we have again
which is A123 amount 250 which is status
a again
and we also have A123 but the status is
D so it is not considering into the into
a resultant equation and also we have
this b212 which amounts 200 and the
status is a so the query is basically
filtering the resultant set in our
output next we are basically mapping the
function we are mapping based on the
customer ID here so we have two
different uh customer IDs which is A123
and b212 so we are and then we are
performing the reduce function based on
the amount right so it is
reducing the value into uh A1 to 3 and b
2 1 2 2 values that is 500 and 250 for B
to 12 it's only 200. so finally if we
look at the output we are performing a
sum aggregation here and you can see in
the final resultant output are uh you
know uh document which we have saved in
a new collection is being retrieved as
ID A123 value is 750 that is 500 plus
250 and also b212 which is value 200
which are which are saving in a new
collection name order totals so this is
how exactly map reduce work which is
again a similar to that of aggregation
you know pipeline method uh I'll let you
know what exactly uh you know how
mapreduce is different from aggregation
Pipeline and when you should be using
which method now before going to uh into
that let us go into the execution part
and see how a mapreduce Works in mongodb
Shell
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started so firstly let us
see the databases for that I'm using the
show DPS command so again we'll be using
the same simplicode database so use
and click code one
and let us now see what are the
collections present of this database so
it will list all the different
collections present to this uh I mean
documents that are present in this
collection so we'll be using a marks uh
you know collection uh for this uh to
perform map reduce so let me just uh
retrieve the values that are present in
this so DB dot marks dot find
enter it will retrieve all the records
so as you can see we have uh various
Fields like ID name subject and marks so
we have like id101 name Ravi maths 94
and similarly we have different subjects
like Science History maths uh English
and so on so we'll be performing map
reduce on this collection and see how it
how it exactly
now what we're going to do is we have to
apply a map reduce operation to this Max
collection to group them by uh let's say
subject and then add the marks scored in
each subject so to processes each input
document we have to define the map
function first this map function
basically refers to the document that
the map reduce operation is processing
in that function and for each document
the function Maps the marks field to the
subject and outputs the marks and the
both subject and marks together so let's
understand how to write the how to
define the map function first and the
query is written as where and mention
any keyword here it can be a map here or
you can even keep it as mapping function
mapping function one you can Define as
per your own choice equals to mention
the function keyword
close the square brackets open Square
flower brackets and mention the keyword
emit
and in that we have to write the
function which is used with this dot so
we are performing aggregation on subject
and marks right so we have to mention
these two parameters here so mention
subject comma this dot marks close the
square brackets flower brackets and
mention the semicolon and press enter
all right we have now defined the
mapping from function first so next we
have to uh Define the reduce function so
the reduce function uh syntax is also
similar mentioned where again mentioned
the param I mean the function name as
per your own choice I'm just taking here
it has reduce
equals to
mention the function keyword again
and you have to pass two parameters here
since you have passed subjective marks
for our you know aggregation function so
just pass any two values it can be us
any name you can take it as key and
value or you can even use subject or
mugs so I'm just using the subject and
marks again here subject comma
marks
and mention the open flower brackets and
you have to return this parameter right
you have to return this function now I
want to perform let's say uh the
aggregation operation like let's say sum
so I'll write array Dot since it is uh
a document and we have various Fields
I'm just writing the array here array
dot sum and inside that mention the
parameter which you are performing are
the summation which is basically marks
right so just close the brackets and
closer for our brackets as well and
enter all right now we have also defined
the reduce function now we are left with
only map reduce operation right so let
us now perform the map radius operation
so the Syntax for that is DP dot mention
the collection name that is marks which
we have taken mention the map reduce
keyword make sure that R in reduces in
capital letters otherwise it will throw
an error and in that pass the uh both
mapping and reduce function names that
you have taken so we have taken it as
map
comma
reduce so it can be any name that you
have chosen it can be like mapping
function one or as I've said earlier it
can be any name but make sure you're
passing the same value that you have
taken and mention the comma again
and in the flower brackets now we have
to mention the keyword out as we
discussed in our syntax previously now
we can give any uh you know collection
name you know to your output a resultant
set it can be of any choice so I'm just
naming it as the result here
I think it will be good to go so let me
just execute the statement
all right uh
it is throwing an error
collection not map it is deprecated user
aggregation instead okay I'm not sure
why it is uh showing that but we can see
result it is saying okay one that means
it has been successfully executed so let
us now and uh see whether whether or not
the aggregation function that is
summation has been performed or data set
or not
so for that I'm again using the find
command DB dot mention the uh collection
name that you have mentioned inside the
parameter and map reduce operation DB
dot result Dot
find enter
as you can see we have total four
subjects and the summation values are
showing as 93.96 I'm not sure why it
should perform the summation operation
so let's just check for history we have
93 and first again 96 all right so it is
showing simultaneously I mean side by
side it shouldn't be like that I'm not
sure why it is uh showing in this way
so let's just uh try to perform another
operation and see whether it is
showing for them as well I'm just
performing an average uh you know
operation here
I'll write let me just check okay we
have that password and let me just uh
perform the map reduce function as well
just copy paste this and you can
let's change the name as result one okay
and click enter I think it's created so
let us find again DB Dot
uh which is again Result One Dot find
well I think there is some issue with
the back end of the mongodb database I'm
not sure why it is uh throwing an error
like this because average value should
be like uh this average of 40 let's say
93 96 right 49 and 47 it's showing in a
different way for maths it's 98 so it's
average it's 49 and for uh 94 it's 47
and the combined value we have to get
but I'm not sure why it is uh throwing
that error
so we'll get back to you guys uh but the
syntax and the execution is the same you
I think there is no mistake in the uh
syntax that you have written here it is
same there might be some issue with the
back end so we'll just get back to you
uh again so stay tuned for that
and well I think that's all about map
reduce we have discussed almost
everything uh you know what map reduces
it's syntax how it works and how uh you
know how it is used you know instead of
aggregation
foreign
and that brings us to the main question
on you know which method you have to be
using whether it's aggregation pipeline
method or it is mapreduce you know
function now complex queries are
difficult to handle in aggregation
framework it can be useful but I would
say it is not recommended for complex
queries whereas if you take small data
sets small data sets will take a long
time to load and map reduce and even
large data sets will take the same
amount of time to process now whether or
not the data set is small or large it
will take the same amount of time to
execute so as a result large data sets
should be handled using the map reduce
functions always and it is an
recommended option the map reduce
function can handle you know large data
sets more quickly due to its uh maybe
it's its flexibility over you know large
data sets so you can always use this uh
while you're you know handling large
volumes of data and on the other side
you can use the aggregation pipeline to
handle small data sets you know for a
regular that usage when you're
performing small calculations that is
present in your you know documents that
is present in your collections I would
say so this is how uh both aggregation
and mapreduce are different from each
other and when you have to use them
and I hope you understood that as well
as you know that mongodb relationship
represents how multiple documents are
logically connected to each other in
mongodb it provides two types of
relationships namely embedded and
referenced embedded documents capture
relationship between data by storing
related data in a single document
structure on the other hand reference
models store the relationship between
data by including links or references
from one document to another now to
implement a normalized database
structure in mongodb we use the concept
of reference relationship that is if you
look at the left side of the screen here
you can have an example where it is a
reference model where we have student
collection and inside we have ID and
then we have another uh you know
document contact details where we are
referencing using this student document
right so in that way we can use
reference model for that so we use this
concept of reference relationship also
referred to as manual or references in
which we manually store the reference
document ID inside another document now
what if the data that you're trying to
search isn't present in different
collection or in different database and
that's where you have to use dbrevs
dbrevs are references from one document
to another using the value of the first
document ID field collection name and
optionally its database DBS basically
allow you to uh more easily reference
documents stored in multiple collections
or database so if you look at this
example I have a user collection here
and a post collection here in the user
collection I have ID name post as my
fields and I'm trying to
fetch those from the post collection
which is another collection in in that
case right so if I'm trying to retrieve
data from another collection which may
be present in another database in such
case you have to reference the database
that you are trying to search for and
that is where we use dbref so and that
will bring us to the main part what is
you know mongodb database references
mongodb database references allow you to
more easily reference documents stored
in multiple collections or database so
relationship between documents can be
represented using this a DB reps which
offer a standard format and type so if a
database needs to communicate with a
variety of Frameworks and tools present
in mongodb Database The dbre Format
offers common links for representing the
data between the documents however in
cases where a document contains
references from different collections in
that case we have to use mongodb ddrefs
so it basically represents a document
rather than a specific reference type
and if you're trying to find data in
more than one collection in such case
you have to use mongodb database
references all right I hope you
understood what it is and let us now
move ahead and understand uh the various
parameters that we use you know while
writing you know database reference
syntax first we have the dollar ref
keyword now ref field basically holds
the name of the collection whereas where
the reference document resides next we
have the ID field the ID field basically
contains the value of the ID field in
the reference document and finally we
have the optional DB which contains the
name of the database where the document
or the reference document resides so in
mongodb these are the three important
fields which should be used in order to
implement dbrev's relationship as
follows
let us now understand the syntax of
mongodb database reference and how it is
exactly used now let's say if I have an
address collection here which I'm
basically creating two different fields
which is ID and City so the command is
the DB dot address dot insert and it is
145 and city is Bengaluru next we have
another document which is DV dot address
dot insert which is the idea is 124 city
is Delhi so firstly we have inserted two
documents in our address collection now
let us move ahead and see
and how we can implement this using
another uh you know collection which is
which might be present in different
database now let's say if I have another
student collection and I mean that I'm
inserting records wherein I am inserting
records of uh student details like ID
I'm providing as one is first name of
the student is Rahul here so as you can
see here inside uh you know the address
ID which is the database reference field
which is part of the document or the
collection student collection present in
this collection we are using mongodb
reference approach to refer the address
ID present in another collection which
we have taken from the address
collection here after defining three
fields which are basically ref ID and
optional DB so the RAF is basically by
providing the field which you want to
reference have a provider reference to
the collection that you are trying to
connect here so earlier we mentioned the
ID and the address in the address
collection right so I am referring to
that that's why I'm providing the
collection name as address and ID as105
and database is optional you can keep
whatever you want I am just taking
simply it as simply code one and
similarly we are again inserting another
document and again we are referencing it
with the dbref dbref field which is
again address ID and for reference I'm
taking again address collection and IDs
124 and DP dot simply code
now you might have a question now what
exactly and how exactly mongodb dbref
works here now the syntax is followed as
where student DB dot student dot find
one which we use in order to uh find the
data now I'm trying to search the first
name with the name of Rohan so I want to
get the details or the address of this
student whose name is Rohan so for that
I'm querying as VAR student address
equals to student dot address ID and
after that mention the syntax as DB in
the Within These square brackets student
address dot dollar ref dot find ID where
student address dot ID now what does it
mean so I'm basically connecting both
the address collection and student
collection and that is what I'm
referring here student address dot
reference and student address dot ID so
in order to get the address of the
student Rohan you have to basically
provide a reference to both these uh
collections so that is what I'm doing
here so when you execute this statement
this will be the final output now for
Rohan we have uh the ID which is 145 and
his City the address is bangaluru so
this is how exactly dbref Works in
mongodb and that brings us to the end of
today's session guys in this tutorial we
have revised the concepts of data
relationships in mongodb for the with
the likes of manual references used for
data modeling in the mongodb and
compared it against the concepts of
mongodb DB reps where the former is used
when the references are to be made to
the documents present in the same
collection so you can use manual
references when you are trying to make
references in the same documents or
which are present in the same collection
and the other uh you know part which is
mongodb dbrefs approaches used when the
references are to be made to the
documents present in different
Collections and in different database
now the main question comes is why is no
longer mongodb dbra's Concepts is not
used it is deprecated uh all around the
world and it is not a suggested method
when you are trying to work on this
mongodb database and that is the reason
also mongodb documentation recommends
manual references unless you have
documents referred to in multiple
locations or the collections in a
database so when you have multiple
collections for your references to
Target we would highly recommend it's
still easier to store the object ID and
collection name in the own object
without specifying or with a special
name of dbrevs and that won't break if
someone insert the field out of the
order now all the dbreps haven't been
deprecated in mongodb as such and the
functionality is unlikely to go away but
hopefully you can see there are good
reasons on why to use and how to avoid
this function that we have discussed in
this tutorial how to use covered queries
and analyze those covered queries and
the performance that it creates while
you query mongodb database so which
helps us to query data more quickly so
without any further Ado let's get
started all right now what are covered
queries now we know that in every
database including mongodb index is play
crucial role mongodb queries are
executed more quickly when indexes are
used as you know we have discussed in
our previous tutorials on mongodb
indexing so if you haven't checked that
out make sure you check that out on our
Channel we have a dedicated playlist on
various mongodb Concepts as well wherein
we have covered mongodb indexing as well
so you make sure you check that out now
indexes basically provide users with an
efficient way of querying data so if you
ran a query to find specific documents
let's say in a collection of thousands
or lacks of documents without any
indexes mongodb would have to search the
entire collection in order to find the
requested document in your query however
mongodb would use indexes if you had
them to reduce the number of documents
that needed to be searched in the
collection now there is a additional you
know part of indexing that is covered
queries so you've probably heard that
column indexing is an excellent way to
improve query performance by reducing
the number of disk access that are
required now covered queries is
basically a mongodb specific application
of field indexing in which all the query
columns are already indexed now it
basically avoids collection scan just
like the normal indexing so it allows
the database to search through less
document to satisfy a query without an
index mongodb has to scan through all
the documents to ensure it has answered
the query correctly now covered queries
are extremely fast because mongodb does
not have to examine any other documents
other than the ones that have been
indexed so it only examines document in
your query that you have provided the
indexing uh that you have provided the
fields that are already indexed
and finally fetching data becomes much
faster using you know covered queries
because uh covered queries return
results from an index directly without
having to access the source document and
are therefore very efficient as well
now there are case when you have to
consider when to use covered queries now
covered queries are only used when all
the fields in the query are part of the
index so let's say if you're trying to
find uh any field in your query it
should be a part of index that you have
already created only then covered
queries can come into picture or can be
used in a more efficient way
next is all the fields returned in the
query should be off are in the same
index now it can be a composite index it
can be a multi-key index but make sure
that the fields that you're returning in
a query should be in the same index and
finally no fields in the query are equal
to null that is field value should not
be null in in such case covered queries
will not be uh followed
now before getting into the execution
part let us just consider a simple
example on how query or covered queries
Works in mongodb so let's say I have a
collection here which has three
different documents uh of various
customers like Rahul pranav and keerthi
and the orders that they have placed and
the various personal details like
address their payment mode email or the
total order items we have an array field
here wherein we are storing uh various
fields in order items like item name
like notebook paper general or postcard
and even their price and the quantity of
the items so we have three different
documents present in our collection here
now if I want to create a simple index
let's say I'm creating an index on
orders item field wherein I'm creating a
particular index on the price here so
and also payment mode I'm creating an
index so the query would be DB dot
orders.create index orders item dot
price I'm mentioning one that is in
ascending order the indexes is created
in ascending order and also for payment
mode I'm creating an index
now generally what you have to do is uh
what you do in general for indexing or
while querying your data that is present
in your collection is you just mentioned
the customer or let's say if I'm trying
to find the customer name here that is
Rahul if I consider this example here it
says DB dot orders dot find customer
Rahul or as item dot price one payment
code one now we are providing the all
the index field that we have created
that is audios item dot price and
payment code
but the query that I'm trying to find is
the data of customer here that is Rahul
which we have not indexed so let's say
I'm just having three uh documents here
now if there are let's say 10 000 10 000
documents that are present in collection
and maybe we have more than one Rahul in
such case it becomes difficult right
even the indexes uh is become an anomaly
here it is not as fast as what we have
thought here now instead of that I'm
just taking another query now let's say
I have created index on orders item dot
price and payment mode right now what
I'm doing is I am trying to return the
data or I'm querying for a data wherein
I'm trying to find the payment mode is
equals to card now if you look at
clearly into our you know index query
that we have created payment mode is
already included in the query Index
right we have already created earlier
and I'm trying to find it in the same
way so I'm trying to find payment Mode
card which is again already created
index which is payment mode so in that
case instead of looking through all the
uh data present in documents it will
simply look at only the ones which are
already indexed and that is the main
advantage of uh you know covered queries
it returns results from an index
directly without having to access any
Source document and it can be more
efficient uh more than just indexing
right so I hope you understood how you
know covered queries are actually
working in mongodb and let's just uh go
into mongodb shell now and get into the
execution part and understand it in a
more clear way and also finally we'll
analyze you know how this query is
working and how it is different from
indexing in mongodb
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started so the First Command would be is
basically the show DBS which will allow
us to show show all the database that
are presented on mongodb database so we
have the simply code one database so
we'll be using that only right use
simply code
so it says switch to DP we are good to
go now let us see the collections that
are present in this database so we have
different collections like collection
name employee marks and new employees so
let us just consider uh all uh I mean a
collection that we have already created
here which is employee so let's just
find the idea
details for the documents that are
present in this collection so I'm using
the V Dot employee dot find command for
that
so when you enter it will display all
the records or the documents that are
present in this collection
all right now let us now create a
covered query now creating a covered
queries similar to that of how you
create an index uh so the query would be
DB dot employee
dot create
and mention the create index keyword
make sure the is capital otherwise it
will throw an error so let's just create
a covered index on the fields let's say
we have manager ID and Department ID
right so we'll be creating uh you know
covered query that is on this two Fields
so
mention the field name that is manager
ID
keep it as one
comma and Department ID as well
as well close the brackets all right and
click enter so as you can see it says
manager ID underscore one Department
underscore ID underscore one that means
you are successfully created you know
covered query on these two fields that
is manager ID and
Department ID so now let's query or read
data from this covered index so for that
we'll again use the find operation so
let's say I'm trying to find you know a
particular manager ID details right so
let's say I want to try find the details
of employees whose manager ID is 123 in
such case I'll use a query that is
DB Dot
employee Dot
find
and inside the brackets let's say
manager
ID
is 123 that I am going to search for
close the brackets and mention the
indexes that you have created here which
is again manage your ID
which is one
comma Department ID
which is again one here
close the brackets I think we are good
to go
so click on enter
so as you can see in the above query
when we find document where we are
trying to find manager ID which is 123
covered index which is on manager ID as
well as Department ID is already loaded
into the RAM and as we know that
so as we know that manager ID is already
present in a compound index that is why
it reads very quickly and we avoid
scanning of too many documents in
database so this is just a basic example
on how to create a covered query so
let's just create a you know another
field where we understand how covered
query exactly works now let's say I'm
trying to create an index on the first
name let's say first name as well
so let's take
the query as DB Dot
create index
I'm just copy pasting it here and let us
create you know another index for our
you know collection for this so it will
be first name here all right first
name
close the brackets
so as you can see our query has been
successfully created now let's say I'm
trying to find the employee details uh
using this uh you know index that you
have created now so I'll just
so let's say I'm trying to find an
employee uh whose first name is Shelly
Now by default since I've created index
on manager ID as well as Department ID
it will be directly indexed and display
in a resultant set so make sure you keep
the first name field also because we
have uh created the index for that as
well
so mention first name
as one
comma all right I think we are good to
go now let's just uh see the result for
this
so there was a bit error in the first
time that we are trying to retrieve uh
now Shelley which we have taken uh her
name in all caps which is not exactly
present in the same way in our you know
collection so make sure uh you keep the
name as exactly which is present in our
database which is capital S and the rest
of them are small caps here so when I
try to uh find the you know resultant
set for this the final output is the
first name which is hush name Shari and
we are getting the manager ID as well as
the department ID that she belongs to
which is manager ID is 101 and
Department ID is 110. now if you look at
this query covered index will not be
available when you use this following
query which is DB dot employee find
first name which is Shelley and we are
mentioning the indexes that we have
created for first name manager ID
Department ID because when we find a
document where first name is Shelley
which has covered index on uh basically
the first name manager ID and the
department ID which is already loaded
into the ram but by default uh you know
underscore ID is also present here that
is the field that is not present in the
covered index is also being displayed so
despite of
you know manager ID Department ID
present in our compound index we cannot
avoid scanning of too many documents in
our database so we need to exclude uh
you know underscore ID as well if you
are trying to use covered index so make
sure you include underscore ID in your
query as well
so the query now that would uh you know
followed as
with the help of uh you know indexes
that you have created make sure with the
first name keep the ID as 0 only then
top
who are mentioning underscore ID after
the department ID
keeping it as zero so let us just find
it now so as you can see we are only
retrieving first name Shelley manager ID
and Department ID and finally uh
underscore ID is being eliminated or
dismissed from this
so that was all about covered index guys
now you have to remember that covered
index does not work when field on which
we're trying to cover in covered indexes
an array or an embedded document that is
when you're trying to retrieve data from
a subdocument or a field that is present
in an array field in such case covered
index won't work so let us now try to
understand how to analyze this query now
the performance of indexing is very
crucial for a database performance right
so we need to understand how it is being
executed you know in the backend as well
so for that we'll use the explain
command here so for that the query is
same guys just copy paste the query that
you have uh you know created
and after that mention the explain
keyword or which is the explain command
here
so there was a bit issue or error in the
uh you know copying this code guys so
I'm just copying paste uh the query that
we have written here which is a DB dot
embroidered find first name Shelly first
name manager ID Department ID and all
the indexes that I've created on and
finally you have to mention the explain
command here now analyzing queries is
very important aspect of measuring how
well or the effective the database and
the indexing design is so for that I'm
using the explain you know command here
which basically provides information on
the query indexes that you have used you
know the performance that is the time
that it has taken to execute your query
and other statistics so it is very
helpful when analyzing how well your
indexes are optimized uh you know while
you are using an indexing or a covered
query so let's just uh see how it works
here click on enter
so you can see it is displaying all the
details of you know the performance or
the optimization of the query that has
taken place in the background here
foreign so you can see we have various
Fields you know listed in all this here
you can see the namespace index filter
set as false and all that now we are
only concerned with here is this stage
input stage is IX scan that is index
scan the short form for this is index
scan so basically that we have performed
a index scan on the query that we have
uh you know created in a resultant set
so it it basically says another
condition where you'll find this is a
collection scan that is co LLS and scan
so you may find that that is you are not
providing any index instead of finding
all the documents one by one
simultaneously using a collection scan
that is another you know scenario in
which we consider you know the type of
scanning that you have done here and you
can also see that index name that we
have created that is first name and it's
multi-key it's it's false unique false
partial false and so on so it basically
indicates the number of you know
documents that have matched that are
returned here it indicates the total
number of documents that we have scanned
and indicates the total number of
documents or index entities that we have
scanned here all this you can find using
the explain operator here firstly let us
discuss what is atomic operations in
general now in context of any database
Atomic operation means that you either
commit to the entirety of the
transaction occurring in the database or
have no transaction at all so it is
basically a complex series of database
operations in which either all or none
of the operations are being performed
while conducting any transactions or you
are trying to you know perform any
operations on your data now essentially
an atomic transaction ensures that any
comment you make finishes the entire
operation successfully or in case of any
lost connection in the middle of
operation due to power failure or any
other external you know factors the
database is rolled back to its state
prior to the comment being initiated so
it make sure that partial changes will
be rolled back if there is any system
failure as such now this is important
for preventing crashes or outages from
creating cases where the transaction was
partially finished to an unknown overall
State now we all know SQL provides you
know asset properties uh concept wherein
you can perform transactions on your
multiple tables right
you can perform various operations like
insert update and delete on your tables
and even if there if there is if a crash
occurs during a transaction with no
atomicity you can you can't exactly know
how far along the process was before the
transaction was interrupted but by using
atomicity you can enjoy that either the
entire transaction was done on your you
know uh table or none of it was done
so as you know it follows the various
Atomic acid properties like atomicity
which is error all the operations inside
a transaction take place or none of it
you know does take place and we have
consistency now consistency means the
data must be consisted before and after
the transaction now let's say if you are
performing a transaction from an account
a to account B for example if account a
has transferred 500 and let's say if the
account B has overall thousand in his
account now if you're performing this
transaction now after the transaction is
done the account we should have 1500
right now in case of any failure or you
know the multiple errors even after that
it must be consistent
so next that is where we have isolation
transaction gets successful in case of
system failures that is what we were
talking about no matter what the
circumstance or the deciding factor of
what has happened to your data it should
maintain consistency that is transaction
should be successful in case of any
system failures and finally we have
durability durability means changes made
to the database must be permanent now
you might work on a database wherein you
have created a temporary change but a
transaction is something which is you
know successfully happens when you are
you know making a database
change is permanently and that is what
asset properties also say that Euro
changes made to the database must be
permanent
now coming to mongodb what is atomic
operations in mongodb and how can we
achieve that foreign
now we know that mongodb does not
support transactions in a database
therefore in the application of your
database pay attention to this point
whatever the design we do not ask
mongodb to ensure data Integrity but
mongodb provides many Atomic operations
you know such as saving a document
modify update and delete as per a
requirement which are basically the
atomic operations that are done in
mongodb database so either this is the
so-called Atomic operation to save the
document to mongodb or not save anything
at all so basically mongodb maintains
atomicity by keeping all related
information in a single document which
need updation now while performing any
uh you know changes or the updation on
the documents if there is an error it
should either update all the documents
or it shouldn't update anything at all
now if you take let's say a limited
number of documents while processing
let's say I have 100 documents and I
have successfully you know updated 50
but the rest 50 are not updated and
because of some external failure or
system crash or crash failure anything
this might occur due to any external
Factor but that is not the case where we
expect our database to you know exactly
work in that way we wanted to either
update all the 100 documents or
just uh not update any of them now this
can be very useful uh and very uh I mean
becomes crucial when you're working with
large number of documents in your
collection let's say if I have 20
million uh you know such documents in my
database it becomes quite difficult
right so in that case what Atomic
operation does is it gives the related
information that you want in a single
document which is an embedded type of
document that saves all your data
now there are some constraints you know
that we have previously discussed that
you know for a database or a noise
database like mongodb Atomic operation
or atomicity is not that easy to achieve
so at mongodb does not support for
multi-document Atomic transactions so if
you want to maintain atomicity uh on
your database and while performing you
know while performing and saving data on
multiple documents it is not feasible
now also mongodb allows among Atomic
operations just on a single document so
in just a in one collection if it has a
single document only then you can
achieve Atomic operation
so atomicity is only maintained or
executed at the document level now like
SQL which uh you know achieves atomicity
at the table level
here in mongodb it is achieved only at
the document level and not the whole
collection you know level
all right so let us now understand how
exactly this works here now let's say I
have uh customer details collection
wherein I am having a document here as
you can see so
which the about document is basically an
embedded document here so as you can see
right uh
where we have the emitted the customer
information according to the item
purchased in the item bought by field
now the single document will help us to
check whether the item is available in
stock or not when a customer places a
new order through item available field
so if an item is available then we'll
subtract the item available field by 1
and insert a new customer name and date
of purchase details in the item bought
by field where we have the details of
all the customers of the document
so in this following example you can see
we have the a particular ID let's say we
have taken as 1899 and the item name is
iPhone which comes in a category of
smartphone and then we have given one
warranty period as one city Bengaluru
country India and the store name or the
branch is so total we have a total of
999 units in the uh koramangala Branch
here and at present we only have 148
available items and the list of all the
uh details of customers who have
purchased iPhone from this store has
been you know embedded into the item
bought by feel very list of all
customers like Rohit who purchased one
quantity of iPhone on 26 September
similarly kirti who purchased two items
on 26 September and so on so first just
for our understanding and I've just
given the four details now let's say if
I have to
you know add someone you know who's
trying to purchase another one in such
case I have to update this document here
so how can we do that now for that we
have different commands to perform
Atomic operations
so first we have this set command set
command is used to specify a key and
update that particular field and if the
key does not exist it will only create a
null value next we have Inc Inc or
increment it can be a numeric value of
the document with a document field in
order to increase or decrease an
operation next we have push this value
is added to the field to go inside the
document it must be an array type field
only then it will accept the value that
is it can be an embedded which is
basically an array field so if the field
does not exist a new array type will be
added and next we have the pull which is
the opposite of push that is it is used
to delete a field from an array of value
which is equal into the document and
finally we have the rename which is used
to modify the field name if necessary
so let us now understand the syntax and
let's try to understand how to perform
the uh you know updation on this field
here
so in this following example we are
going to use the find and modify command
in order to perform the atomic operation
on our uh you know collection here so
this basically command helps to search
and update the document simultaneously
and it it's a operation on a document
and it tries to achieve atomicity that
is if the find condition matches a
document the update is performed on that
document and all the concurrent queries
are additional updates on that document
are not affected until the current
update is totally complete so the syntax
is followed as DB dot now let's say our
collection name is customer dot details
find and modify and inside the brackets
the query would be query mention the ID
which is 8099 which you have taken item
available so we are checking whether the
item available we are giving the
condition as greater than zero so if and
only if the item is greater than 0 only
then we have to update and then we are
incrementing the value that is in the
item available we are incrementing by
decreasing the value in the total await
items available that is by minus 1 and
then we are pushing the value that is we
are inserting the new record into the
orders bought by uh field wherein we
have the customer details so I am
pushing uh this details of customer name
let's say Ajay and the date of purchase
is 1st October so I hope you've clearly
understood the syntax and how it goes so
let's just go to mongodb Shell and see
how it gets executed so as you can see
mongodb shell has started uh we'll use
the show DPS
command in order to view all the
databases present in a database so we'll
be again uh using the simply code one
database so simply code one
all right let us see the collection
present inside that for that I'm using
show collections so as you can see we
have customer details which have already
created in hindsight so we'll be using
that so let's just try to find what are
the uh details that are present in this
so because DB Dot customer details dot
find
so as you can see uh we previously
discussed the same example here and that
is also what I've created in this as
well so ID is 1899 item name iPhone
smartphone category warranty period one
city details Country Branch item total
999 items available 147 item bought by
now these are the list of customers I'm
just including only five uh I don't I
didn't have the type 2 you know insert
all it uh details of all the customers
it's it's time breaking actually so just
to understand for your basic uh you know
level I'm just creating only four
documents here I mean file documents or
the details of the customer now let's
say uh as discussed in the uh you know
presentation now I'm trying to add
another customer whose name is Ajay and
his date of purchase for that the
following query would be
DB Dot customer details dot use find and
modify make sure the MS Capital
otherwise it will throw an error and
inside that I'll write the following
query which is the keyword query
mention the ID name which is underscore
ID
which is equals to 1899
comma
item available we have the item
available field right so mention that I
item available
is make sure it is greater than use the
dollar greater than uh operator
is greater than zero only then our
updation or the transaction will be
completed and this
so close the flower brackets and now
what we are trying to update the value
right so mention the update
and we are using the increment operator
here so dollar
Inc
put semicolon
and now we know that if the item is
purchased it has to reduce its count by
one so the totem idle item available is
147 here so I am decrementing
decrementing the value by one so it
should become 146 so keep remembering
and just see that how it is reflecting
in our resultant set now so item
available
should be minus 1 it should decrease by
one value all right so close the
brackets mention comma and now we are
pushing the uh customer details into the
item bought by field so we have to
mention that as well so a dollar
push
mention the item bought by field
whereinvale embed all the details of the
customer item
but
by
mention the semicolon and inside the
flower brackets mention the customer
details customer name is let's say a j
comma and mentioned the date as well
so let's say I'm taking it as first
October
October 2022
all right
and close the inverted commas and
mention all these flower brackets that
we have used
right I think this is the query I think
we are good to go now
so press enter
uh I think there is an error
so the errors says that you know DB Dot
customer ID also is fine and modify is
not a function I think uh a also should
be in caps I think we just forgot that
so let me just copy paste it again
and
change that
so instead of small a here for and I'll
just keep capital A I think that will be
fine so is there let's just check once
again
uh
I think we are good to go now I think
there's no more errors I think it should
be fine
well as you can see it has successfully
executed now in order to find whether it
has you know successfully updated what
you're trying to find in our you know uh
document let's just use the find command
again so I'm using DB Dot
details dot file
so as you can clearly see that uh see
previously we had items available 147
now it is showing item available as 146
and it has also added the customer
details which is customer name is Ajay
and the date is 1st October 2022 so what
we're trying to do here is here we first
searched for the item with the ID which
we have created which is 1899 now when
such item is found we are basically
incrementing the item available field by
-1 that is the logic behind this is if
you purchase an item it will reduce its
count by one and updating the item
bought by field which is an embedded
field which stores the data of the
customers right so by adding the
customer name and the date of purchase
of item and then we are printing the
overall purchase detail by using fine
and fine method right and we can observe
that the item available field has
changed from 147 to 146 and also the new
customer details have been added in your
item bought by feed so in this way you
can create you know you can achieve
atomicity in a single document rather
than multi-documents that you can
perform now we also have two different
options of doing this which is update 1
and update many as well
so as the name suggests update one
method modifies a single document in a
collection whereas update many modifiers
one or more documents in the collection
so let us know and let us know if you
want to create a separate video on uh
how to create that as well or
type in the comments below if you can
try that and we will see if you have the
uh you know knowledge on how to create
uh you know atomicity by creating update
1 and update many so let us see if you
can try to write the command for that so
make sure to write in the comments below
and we'll try to answer your you know
queries or any doubts that you have
gotten while writing the code
well I think that is pretty much uh all
about the atomic operation in mongodb
that we have discussed here which brings
us to the end of the capped Collections
and see how it is different from a
normal collections discuss its
advantages and disadvantages and then
should be using all right so what is Cap
collection in mongodb now CAD collection
is a special type of collection that has
either a fixed number of documents in a
collection or only a fixed number of
elements in it it basically creates new
documents by overriding the oldest
documents in the collection and also cab
collections have maximum size or
document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond the maximum threshold
that is been available now all capped
collection must specify a maximum size
and may also specify a maximum document
count as well mongodb removes older
documents if a collection reaches this
maximum size limit before it reaches the
maximum document count so overall the
structure and functionality of a capped
collection supports high performance and
also the high throughput performance for
applications and the overall
performances of crud operations like
create read and delete operations as
well
so let us now understand why we use
mongodb camera collection but before we
begin we have to understand how it is
different from a normal collection and
how exactly they differ from each other
so basically in comparison to normal
collection cap collections are created
in advance and are only of fixed size
whereas the normal collections are
created dynamically and it generally or
automatically grows in size to fit the
extra data that we need to incorporate
in our database so these capped
collections on the other hand are
designed to consume less space under
rotating that means once allocated space
is full it will start riding from older
documents again and that is the reason
it is called as a circular buffer
collection or simply a circle correction
which means whenever the collection size
is extra exhausted it starts deleting
the old documents automatically without
explicitly providing any commands to the
database and some operations that are
not allowed on a capped collection says
that documents cannot be removed with a
mad like you know drop Collections and
also updates that make document to grow
in size are not allowed also
so that comes to the main point on why
we use you know mongodb collections
first one is in order to ensure the
insertion order is maintained so capped
collection offer very high performance
as we discussed earlier for credit
operations because they preserve
insertion order so unlike normal
collection which keep on adding uh you
know the data into its collection uh
capped collections on the other hand
make sure that once the data is
completely filled in the collection it
will automatically delete and the
insertion operation is done on the basis
of uh you know the first come and first
sub basis
and next also we discussed Auto removal
of oldest documents
so in order to make room for the new
documents you know into a collection cap
collection basically automatically
removes the oldest documents in the
collection without writing you know
scripts or explicit remove operations in
our uh you know mongodb database and
finally install the cache data that
needs to be refreshed frequently now we
know that mongodb is a huge nosql
database and we have a lot of amounts of
data that is being generated on a daily
basis so in the same way we need to
process or you know retrieve that
information quickly right so there's a
lot of catch catchy data that is being
generated on a frequent basis so in
order to you know store all that
information capped collections can be a
useful uh tool for you
so we saw some of the main reasons why
we use mongodb cap collections all right
let's next let us discuss some uh
characteristics of cab collections in
mongodb
now firstly no delete operations can be
performed now as discussed earlier uh if
you are looking to delete a document
from a cap collection then basically you
are looking into the wrong direction as
we cannot delete documents from a
collection the old documents in a
capital collection can only be deleted
automatically upon insertion of the new
documents when the allocated size uh to
the capped collection has been exhausted
or the maximum limit has been reached
next all the elements and collection
should have an equal size so basically
when you are creating a caps collection
you have to mention the size of that cap
collection and each element will take
the equal size of it so let's say if you
have allocated a size of let's say 100
bytes and you are trying to insert four
records in that so each element or each
document will take 25 bytes of size
so it says in equal amounts of size in
the collection next it works as a queue
and because of this no indexing is
required now a cabbed collection does
not contain any default indexes like in
general or to the contrast of a normal
collection which might seem strange in
addition to this even the ID field lacks
an index for this so mongodb doesn't
waste any time searching for a location
to store a new document on the disk
let's say when you're performing an
insert operation on a capped collection
it is possible for mongodb to add the
new document to the end of the cap
collection easily so the insert
operations in collections run very
quickly because there is no wastage in
disk space organization and it is also
useful to keep log files as well so
mongodb as we discussed earlier
maintains a running log of events you
know including entries such as the in
incoming connections commands uh you
know the data that you are being
provided and all other stuff you know
into the database so generally log major
log messages are useful for diagnosing
issues monitoring your deployment and
tuning your performance so in order to
uh keep all these log files and to
access them in a frequent manner we use
cap collections so these are some of the
main characteristics of CAD collections
I hope you guys have understood so let
us now move understand and discuss the
syntax that is how to create a capped
collection in mongodb now the simple
syntax is DB dot uh now you can use the
syntax that you use for a create
collection right so it is similar to
that only db.create collection mention
the collection name as per your size and
after that mention the keyword capped
and then Boolean now Boolean here I'll
discuss uh next when we you know go
through each of this next we have size
mention the number of bytes next we have
Max number all right so firstly we have
the grid collection which is a method to
create a new cap collection right next
we have a collection name it basically
represents the collection name that you
want to create we can use any name for
for our cab collection next we have the
capped keyword and then we are
specifying a Boolean value here so we
have to say that capped option which is
either true or false so if you have set
the capped option to true then our
collection will be created as a capped
collection so in on the other hand if
you have specified The Collection option
as false then the collection is created
without any cap collection and finally
we have the size size option will
specify the limit of size for the capped
size cab collection sorry so we can
specify the size of our collection in
bytes in general for capped collections
so this parameter is actually mandatory
when we have defined a collection which
is of a capped collection type
and finally we have Max where you have
to provide a number that is how many
documents that you want to incorporate
in your cap Collections and when you
want to specify uh or you know limit the
maximum number of documents that are
allowed in your collection size option
will give preference over the max option
in mongodb in general
so that was uh the basic syntax on how
to create a cad collection and if you
want to know whether your collection has
been capped or not you can use this
following command which can be visible
on your screen which is DB dot let's say
my uh
you know collection name is capital log
collection and if you want to see
whether it is created or not I am using
ease capped keyword so this is how you
can use these commands in order to
create and view your collection which is
of capped type in your mongodb database
so I hope you understood how to create
uh this I mean the syntax on how to
create a cap collection so let us now
directly jump into mongodb shell for
execution part
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started and firstly let us look at our
databases which will be our first
command which is show DBS so again we'll
be using the same simply code one
database
in order to understand how cap
collection works so let's let us see the
collections that are present
so simply code one has various
collections like cap log collection
collection name customer details
employee masks and new employees so let
us now firstly uh create a capped
collection so as we already discussed
the syntax of uh the capped collections
so let's just execute it now
so the uh
syntax is followed as create mention
create collection keyword
and inside that mention the cab
collection name so let's just take a
log collection one so you can keep it a
name of your own choice so
it's up to Yahweh
lose the uh
brackets and
open the flower brackets and mention the
capped keyword and I'm specifying it as
true that is we want to create a new
capped collection all right
and select as true and comma
mention this size so let's just keep
let's say thousand bytes for our cab
collection so this is how you basically
create a capped collection in your
mongodb database click on enter
so it will say OK one that means you
have successfully created now we have
only create uh you know specified this
size to our capped collection so if you
want to limit the number of documents
that you want to you know insert into
your cap collection then you have to
mention the maximum size also so for
that what you'll do is we'll provide the
additional uh you know Max uh constraint
as well so after size mention the max
keyword
and just for our understanding I'm just
keeping it uh you know where for a
simple number I'm just keeping three all
right so since I'm keeping 10 3 is the
number of documents that the collection
will collection will overall have so
let's say if you're trying to insert
another documents after you know
inserting first three documents then it
will automatically replace with the new
one so let's just see how it will work
but I think we have to change the
collection name again here so I'm just
taking it as log collection too
and okay
Okay click on enter all right again it
says ok one that means you have
successfully created or not created but
again let's just find out whether uh you
know correction is capped or not for
that we have already discussed we have
to use the East cab you know method for
that so DB dot mention the collection
name which is a log collection to
dot is make sure the capped uh C is
capital
so it is true so that means we have
successfully uh you know created a
capped collection and it is not just a
normal collection so let us now try to
insert some records or data into our you
know this capped collection and see how
it works so DB Dot
uh mention the collection name which is
log collection
two dot again you can use the insert
command which is a regular one right
so mention the OpenFlow brackets and
let's say let's just take let's just
insert uh you know a normal a basic type
of info let's take name I'm just taking
it as let's say a Rohan
all right let's close the brackets
all right it is uh
okay now you might find this warning it
says collection dot insert is deprecated
you use insert one insert menu or bulk
right as in your comment but it's just
fine you know you can also use just
insert it will work as you can see it
has successfully created acknowledge
true and it has inserted ID so similarly
we will insert another two documents
and see how it actually represents in
you know in our real time so let's just
take uh
another name let's say uh pretty
all right and let us take another
a pair of
sticking a random name so I think
so we have cleared successfully inserted
three and since we have put a limit of
Maximum three I'm just inserting three
and what will happen if you're trying to
insert the fourth record we'll see how
it works so let's just uh display the
records that are present in a collection
for that I am again using our collection
name and I'm using the find method here
so as you can see it is successfully
retrieving all the three documents that
is uh the details of Rohan Priti and
bivof now what if I am trying to insert
a new document here all right I'm just
copying this and let's say I'm trying to
insert a fourth document in this uh I'm
trying to insert a new document whose
name is let's say Kiran so
in such case and if I am trying to find
uh the data again that is present in our
you know law collection which is a cap
collection so you can see that
we had previously had Rohan Preeti Baba
now we have Preeti bhaiwav and Kiran
that means the older one which is uh
Rohan has been successfully deleted from
our you know uh collection here so we
know that due to the circular and the
fixed side nature of the capped
collection there are restrictions to
this update operations so whenever you
are trying to add a new data and if
updating of any document in the
collection results in the increase of
the document size so previously we had
three and now we are increasing it to
four that is the size is increasing then
mongodb will not update this document in
that collection because documents in the
cab collections are stored in the order
of disk disk storage which ensures the
size of a single document does not
exceeds its allocated size on the disk
so that is the reason why uh it is
basically based on the first come first
sub basis and it will automatically
delete the old documents whenever you're
trying so trying to insert a new
document into our collection
so this is how in general you know CAD
collection works I hope you understood
that now let's say if you want to
convert you know already present
collection which is a non-cap collection
if you want to change it to a cad
collection in such case you can use
another queried for that right so
basically the query would be
DB Dot
run command
open the flower brackets and mention the
keyword which is convert Capital to T
o and capital capped Capital C in cap
keyword all right so let's just enter it
now let us take one collection here
let's say I'm trying to change this
employee which is a non-capped
collection into a cad collection so I'm
just specifying employee here
okay I forgot to mention
videos
inverted comma so mention in the
inverted commas and again provide the
size let's take a size as 10 000 bytes I
mean it's a your preference you can give
it as per your need and maximum I want
to store only 100 documents in this uh
you know cab collection
so as you can say it is successfully
saying okay one that means you have
successfully converted a non-capped uh
collection which is employee collection
into a capped collection
well I think uh we have covered pretty
much all about you know what is a cat
collection how to create it its syntax
and how it exactly works it is
authentication in mongodb and we'll show
you how to enable authentication so that
only authorized users can access the
database and its content present in
various Collections and documents in
mongodb database so what is
authentication in mongodb now
authentication and authorization are two
important concepts of any database
authenticating users with your database
is a critical security feature as well
as the authorization now these two terms
might be uh similar but they have a
different meaning to each other now when
it comes to authentication identifying
all the users who connect to the
database is called as authentication on
the other hand authorization is
basically restricting actions on
authenticated users that can perform any
operations in your database which is
known as authorization now similarly in
a nosql database like mongodb we do
provide authentication for users in
order to curve some unrestricted
activity from others while performing
you know mongodb operations so this is
especially true when the database
contains sensitive data such as users
accounts for a website or company's data
so basically when you enable
authentication on your mongodb instance
you can specify what user accounts are
allowed to do and what level of access
they have and what level of uh you know
activity they cannot have so this also
means that you can restrict access to
certain features to only authorized
users working with no authentication can
be okay for you know developing a
a development or testing environment
initially but when you're in production
with customers and the data stored
inside is mandatory or which is of key
importance it is important to restrict
access to the database so that only a
specific amount of users who have the
authenticity or authentication to the
database has the access to uh you know
cover all the operations within the
mongodb database
so that is what exactly is
authentication and mongodb it is
basically the process of confirming a
client's identity that is it requires
all clients to authenticate themselves
when access control that is whenever the
authorization is enabled to them
now authentication is done in three
different ways in three different stages
now firstly we have to create the users
so users who have access control enable
must identify themselves and are only
permitted to take actions that fall
under the permissions granted by the
role assigned to them now before
creating a user you need to have you
need to enable Access Control enabling
access control on a mongodb basically
deploys the authentication process and
finally after giving Access Control you
need to authenticate a user finally you
need to provide the username password
and the authentication database linked
to that user which is required not to
authenticate as per that user
now there are various commands you know
that you can use to authenticate mongodb
database so for creating modifying and
delete deleting users within mongodb and
configuration and to configure
authentication the core methods you need
are DB dot create user this basically
creates a user for authentication
purpose
next we have the DB dot update user and
DB dot drop user these two basically
updates the details of a user account as
well as the let's say mongodb user
account and finally we have DB dot
change user password it basically
changes the user uh passwords your
password used by the user account
so let us now understand how to create
authentication in mongodb for that we
have already learned that we need to
create a user and the syntax is uh
followed as DB dot create user within
the parenthesis mention the user keyword
wherein I'm just taking admin and I'm
giving the password as one two three ABC
now we have another
criteria where we have uh we need to
mention the roles here and within the
parenthesis I mentioned the role as user
admin and the database that we are
providing is admin database here
now once you're done with this it will
basically say that it's okay but that
means you have successfully
authenticated but you read another step
in order to verify whether it is created
or not you need to use the auth that is
DB dot auth is a keyword wherein your uh
verifying whether the authentication is
done on the database that you have done
or not so I'm just checking using this
syntax which goes as DB dot auth uh
mentioned in the database which is admin
sorry the user username that you have
given as admin and the password we have
given is one two three ABC so this is
how you can create authentication in
mongodb by using the create user method
I hope you understood this so let us now
jump into the execution part and see how
exactly it is done so as you can see
mongodb Compass has started now firstly
model Lewis will create a database and
inside that will create a collection and
basically then we'll do authentication
on this collection wherein we'll do some
read and write uh you know restrictions
you know for the New Year's new user who
is trying to insert new documents into
that collection so let's just create a
database first let's take let's say I'm
creating a student database so I'm
giving a student DB and let's take a
collection name as student details all
right so let's just create it
student DB has successfully created
database now you can go into this
collection and let's just add some data
for our reference and uh let's see I'm
just going to insert some simple uh
document into others so
we'll add basically a field I'm just
giving name and the name would be
let's say Rohan and I'm adding another
field
let's say h is uh 25 all right so let's
just insert this now we are successfully
inserted a document into a collection
student and details now we are done with
this now let's just go to mongodb Shell
and get in with the commands now so you
can directly open the mongodbit shell or
even you can use CMD wherein you can
open command prompt and you can give the
command as Mongoose which is basically
your connection to mongodb Shell which
is a shortcut
so just wait for it and it will
successfully open so let us now see what
are the databases that are present in
our database so we have various
different databases like admin company
DB config local simply code one student
DB test
right so now you can create
authentication on any database as per
your business you can even create a you
know authentication on admin database
company and DB database so for a bit of
better understanding we have considered
here student debut database so we'll
basically use that use
student DB so it's ready be now
let's say show Collections and we'll see
we have the student details so let us
now find the details for that student
dot DB dot student details dot file
so we have inserted one document uh
which is of name Rohan and age 25 so
this is basically a normal uh way of
creating a document in a database right
so let's just create another uh just
insert another document into this okay
for our reference I'm just taking a
reference and we'll see how when you're
trying to add or when I try to read or
write some operations after
authentication how it will impact so
and just create inserting another one
it's run it a lot insert and within the
flower brackets mention the
single quotes name let's say name as uh
oven
mentioned in single quotes
close the brackets and let us take age
as
268
close the flower brackets and enter
so it will say it is successfully
executed now let's just try to find this
again
so we have inserted two documents here
now this is done now we have to create
basically a a user for creating the
authentication for our database now
we'll see how to create that now since
we already discussed I'm just copy
pasting it here guys
so as you can see I am creating a user
which is of username Rahul and I am
giving password as per your choices
let's say one two three ABC and then I'm
providing the role switches role as user
admin let's say and the DBS student DB
all right so press enter
so there was a bit of error in the code
guys now basically there are some
certain you know keywords for role here
so for admin access you have to provide
only as admin not as user admin and I am
here taking the role I just read so that
whenever you are trying to perform a
read operation on that it will provide
an authentication for that for our
database so you can see it was
successfully created and it shows OK and
one now we are done with this part now
basically we just created a user now we
have to enable the authentication so for
that you have to find the
mongodb.cfd file so now where you'll
find that is basically in your uh you
know where you have installed your
mongodb so I'll just navigate to that
path first so open uh the C folder where
or the location where you have said I
have saved this in C drive so go to
program files go to mongodb folder click
on server click on 6.0 go to bin
and you can see mongod.cfd so this is
the file we want click right click and
let's say open with Notepad
so once you open this you'll find a log
like a description of all the
configuration that it has when you
scroll down a bit you will find that
hashtag security so remove this call a
comment and just write
as Authentication
enabled okay what this does is basically
you're giving control access to your
database so so that of any other user is
trying to you know read your operations
from your database he can uh use this so
let's just save this
key program file or you don't have
permission to save this location contact
the administrator to obtain permission
click on yes
so we have successfully given the
authentication where we have provided
the command liners or the authentication
enabled now once you are done with this
you have to restart your system so for
that you have to basically stop the
services of mongodb now for that what
you'll do is basically just go to your
home page try to find for mongodb
scroll down a bit and I think you'll
find here uh yeah so mongodb server it's
running click right click on that
so we have successfully uh restarted the
mongodb server so let's just go to
mongodb shell again
open CMD and type Congress
all right now let's say show DBS and let
us use the student DB
collections
all right now we have student details in
our uh collections of student DB
database now since we have authenticated
it let's just verify whether it is
created or not so for that I'm using
tv.auth which you have discussed earlier
open the uh square brackets
So within the inverted codes mention the
username that we have provided as
student DP only for our database and
mention the
password so we have kept as one two
three ABC all right so just close it and
press enter so it says ok one that means
you have successfully created uh the
authentication on your database now
whenever you are trying to retrieve data
uh it will make sure that you know only
a limited number of people having this
username and this password has this uh
you know in order to open this
collection so let's just try to find
whether it is showing or not so for that
I'm using the student details dot find
command
and you can see the details are being
displayed for our uh the user who's
trying to uh retrieve the data that is
present in our student return details
database after uh you know accessing the
after getting the authentication from
the database so this is how you can
create authentication uh on a user
database you can even create an admin
database or even you can create on test
database and with that we have come to
the end of today's session guys I hope
you've covered everything pretty much
about you know authentication in mongodb
so authentication is like one of the
most critical point of uh you know any
database in terms of security it will
basically allow us to wired it and
verify the information of the user who
is connected with the current instance
of mongodb and if any user has no uh
privilege or association with the
database collection then his request
will be automatically well denied and
this is where authentic authentication
plays an important role without having a
user relationship with the database we
cannot authenticate the user user and
role Management in mongodb and
understand various commands that are
used to perform these two technicalities
so firstly let us discuss what are user
management commands now user management
commands are basically used to manage
the user access to the database mongodb
offers an internal method called
db.create user method that allows user
to be added to this system now unlike
conventional databases like uh SQL or
relational databases mongodb users are
connected to local database known as
authentication database and additionally
unique identifiers include the
authentication database and the user's
name assigned to it and consequently if
two users are created in different
database but have the same names they
are recognized as two separate users
therefore rather than creating the user
multiple times in various database one
should allow a single user to have the
rights or roles to the relevant database
instead of creating the user multiple
times in different databases so let's
say if one wants to create a single user
with permissions on multiple database we
can give the access to that particular
person so that is basically what is user
management is all about in mongodb now
that is done using various commands in
mongodb database now first we have the
most important one which is create user
this method basically is used to create
a new user in your mongodb instance next
we have the drop all users from database
it is used to delete all the users from
a database or the collection of data
that you have in your documents right
and next we have the drop user command
which is used to Grant a task and its
privileges to a user next we have Grant
roles to user it is basically assigning
a role and its Associated privileges
that can be given to a user on a basis
on a regular basis and finally next we
have revoke roles from user which is
used to remove the access to the user
role that we have given earlier next we
have the update user this method
basically is used to update a user's
data and finally we have users info so
let's say if you want to return the
information of the users that you have
created you can use the user info so
these are some of the major user
management commands that we use in
database now you will understand it more
clearly when we get into the execution
part so for now let's just understand
what this is okay let's move ahead and
understand what a role management
commands now now roles Grant users
access to mongodb Resources by providing
several built-in roles that enable the
administrators or the users to control
the access to a mongodb system although
these roles cannot describe the desired
set of privileges one can create new
roles in a particular database time to
time so except for functions created in
the admin database a rule can only
include rights that applies to its
database and those inherited from other
roles and only the user who has granted
this access has this you know permission
you know in order to control and access
the data from that mongodb database so
similar to user management we have
various different commands here as well
the first one is create role it is
basically used to create a role for the
user database and say what you can
perform to that database next we have
drop role it basically removes the role
that was set by the user so which is the
again the opposite of creator so if you
want to create drop a row that you have
assigned to the user you can use the
drop role command next we have drop all
rows from database now let's say if you
have created a user and given let's say
five to six roles to that particular
user now for due to some external
factors or reasons if you want to delete
all those roles at a time you can use
drop all rows from database command
which basically removes all the rows
that the users from the database has set
up next we have the grant privileges to
roll it is used to assign privileges to
a role that the user chooses and finally
we have the update rule which basically
updates the role that was set up by the
user now again these are some of the
major uh commands that we use in as uh
mongodb if you want to learn more about
these you can go to mongodb your website
and clearly understand what are the
different commands that we are using and
we will basically execute them in
mongodb shell and only then you'll
understand how important and how they
exactly get executed so so let's
dive directly into mongodb shell but
before that we will just see a simple
example where we'll understand how user
and role management command works now
I'm using a simple database which is
employees and then I'm creating a user
which is the syntax is followed as DB
dot create user and then I'm giving
username as rohan123 and I'm giving the
password one two three ABC and next I'm
also giving the roles to this user that
is I'm giving the read operation that is
uh the user who have the access to this
database employs can only read the
information that is he can just view the
data but he cannot make any changes to
this DB employs table so I hope you
understood uh this so let us now
directly jump into the execution part so
as you can see mongodb shell has started
and the basic command is basically to
show the different database in our
different databases present in our uh
you know mongodb instance so for that
I'm using the show DPS command
which will bring all the virtually all
the databases like admin company DB
config local simply code one student DB
and test
so we know that before we enable Access
Control you should create a user that
can create users and assign roles to
them once access control is enabled so
this user admin will then use to create
and maintain other users and role which
needs to be assigned a suitable role to
enable it to to do so so you can have
various low roles like admin role you
can give the read operation you can give
right operation either and you can
simultaneously give read and write
operations on on the data that you want
to perform uh the analysis or the
changes you want to make
so before creating a mongodb user
actually it is worth thinking about the
task the user is going to perform now
let's say I have a database here let's
say simply code one and I have a user
who is who constantly uh changes or
updates data from the database then I
can give the role to the to that
particular user is rewrite operation so
by Chain probably there will be several
users with the same level of permissions
also so the smartest option is to create
a role and assign it to each of these
users and by only changing a role you
will update the permission where all the
users who has the access to it otherwise
a change to an access requirement for a
group or you know a group of users would
need to be done for every single user
every time so the first step is to
change context to database in which
you're going to create this role so
let's just create a simple
uh you know roll to a database
so for that I'm using the simply code
database only here so let's say excuse
simply code one
so it is switched to Simply code one
so when adding a new user to the
specified database and for in our case
it's simply code one we use the
db.create user method which is the
fundamental command so it is important
to note that adding users with option is
much simpler than inserting a user
document into a non-relational database
so the query is followed as DP Dot
create
User make sure the US capital otherwise
it will throw an error open the brackets
and inside that mention the keyword user
so let's say I'm giving the user name as
let's take a Rowan one two three four
close the brackets and then mention the
password PWD
so you can either give a password or you
can give a password prompt password
prompt is basically will ask you to
enter the password every time you
request access to this database so I'm
just using the password prompt command
here
and then you have to specify the roles
that you want to create your uh you know
database so let's say I'm just giving a
simple role as let's take as read
operation right so for that I am
providing roles
and
within the uh square brackets
mention the role
keyword
semicolon and since we are concerned
with read I am giving it as a read
and then mention the database that you
are giving the access to so the the
database is simply code one all right
make sure it is in inverted commas again
otherwise it will draw an error
so I think the code is done let's just
execute this again close the square
brackets make sure to check all the
brackets are being properly closed
otherwise it will throw an error
we have a square bracket
and then I think
oops again another on this okay
so it says enter password now you can
give password of your choice so let's
update one two three quality dot okay
so it's easy to successfully executed
let's just walk through what you have
created here now to create a user who
will manage a single database here which
is the simply code one we can we are
using the same command which is the
dp.create user and in that uh we are
giving a particular user name and then
we are giving the rules to it so the
first step is basically to specify the
username and password which needs to be
created and the second step is to assign
a role for the user which in this case
needs to be up is a general user not the
user admin right so we are just
assigning a role which is the read
operation here this role basically
allows the user to have privileges only
to the database specified in the DB
option which is simply code one so the
DB parameter specified that database to
which the user should have the
administrative privileges on so the
output basically shows that it was
successfully created and it is asking
for a password now you can generally
give a password of your own choice or
you can either just give a password
prompt and then you can enter the
password
so this is how you create a user now
next you have to manage these users so
for that you have to understand the
rules which you need to Define now
there's a whole list of roles available
in mongodb as discussed earlier now for
this one we have given read now there is
also read write there is also user admin
which we give for administrative uh you
know privileges or uh someone who have
the who needs to be a database
administrator who constantly works on
that database so for that we provide
with that so then we have this again
read role which basically allows you to
read only access to databases and then
there is read write also which provides
read and write access to the database
which means that the user can insert
delete update commands on collections in
that database so let's just create
another uh user where it will create
multiple roles and understand how it
works here
so again I'm just copy pasting this and
will create another user and see so
let's just change some of the names here
let's take the new user as
user one
and let's take the password from same
and then we will assign different roles
now for different databases for this
user okay
now once we have created a read
operation for simply code right now
let's take another database let's say
company DB so for that I am creating
another role
which is read write okay
so there is a small error so I'm just
copy pasting the file which I've already
created to show you so I'm just creating
a new user and then I'm
creating a user named rohan123 and let's
take the password as one two three ABC
and the rows that I'm giving to this
user are from various database so for
let's say for simply code one I'm giving
the role as read operation and for
company DB I'm giving you operation
Alpha student DB I'm giving the rewrite
operation so mongodb defines roles
uniquely by combining the database with
the role name and each role is scope to
the database you have created but
mongodb generally stores all the role
information in this collection in the
admin database so for instance the role
and Grant role actions on the database
resource must ensure that sir roles are
created and granted in the database so
let's just execute this and see the
output so it says ok one that means you
have successfully created a user now you
want to see all the users that you have
created in the simply code one you can
simply use the show users command which
will list out all the users that you
have created so it says simply got
1.1123 DB simply code one and the read
roles that you have created is read
operations for this database for read
operation for company DB read operation
for simply code and so on
and you can also show the roles as well
separately so it will just show all the
different roles so let's say role DB
owner DB simply code one
and like in a similar way all their
operations all the roles that you have
given uh will be showcased here I think
we have pretty much covered the basics
of user and uh role management commands
and this what are mongodb session
commands now session commands basically
allow you to provide specific
instructions to the database through a
command language using certain uh
commands so we'll be learning uh exactly
what are the mongodb sessions and
various types of commands that are used
in this criteria so firstly what are
session commands in mongodb now a
session is basically is used to group
together a series of operations that are
related to each other which would be
executed with the same session options
now if you consider mongodb mongodb
shell does not uh is not typically used
to write and execute transaction the
majority majority of the time external
applications use transaction instead so
the application must initiate a session
in order for any transaction action it
performs to be guaranteed with the acid
properties like atomicity consistency
isolation and durability
so a session is a database object in
mongodb that is controlled by an
application using a proper mongodb
driver which can be used with various
applications like CEC plus plus python
Java and other applications as well so
this basically enables the driver to
apply additional configurations such as
enabling the use of transaction whether
you want to start a transaction or you
know terminate a transaction to even a
group of database statement as a whole
so as a result they will have a shared
context and can be associated with each
other using the session commands where
it will process sequence of database
statements
so that is what exactly the session
commands are in mongodb
so this can be performed using various
mongodb session comments so we have
typically five session commands in
mongodb namely
firstly we have the about transaction
command which is basically is used to
stop or terminate the ongoing
transaction next we have the commit
transaction command which is used to
permanently save all the transactions
done in the mongodb database next we
have the end sessions command which
expires is to expire any ongoing
sessions before the timeout so in
general mongodb has a timeout period of
30 minutes so after that it will
automatically in the session within a
mongodb instance so if you want it to
done before the computer automatically
does to you you can use the in session
command next we have the kill all
sessions images used to terminate all
these sessions right as the name says
kill all next we have the kill all
sessions by pattern now you can even
terminate a session or stop a particular
session by using a specified pattern so
if ever if the pattern matches a
specified uh you know character that you
mentioned in your server session in in
that case you can use skill all sessions
by Batman now we'll be understanding
each of them in a more depth with its
syntax and how it works
now apart from this we have the basic
and the generic type of session commands
in mongodb where we have refresh
sessions kill sessions and start session
all
so the refresh session command is used
to update the end use time for the
specified session by extending the
active state of the session so if you're
working on a particular uh transaction
and if you want to uh you know refresh
it in that case you can use the refresh
session command which will basically
extend the period of this session that
your the ongoing session is happening
next we have the kill session so if you
want to uh you know exit or terminate
only a particular uh specified you know
uh session for the user in such case you
can use the kill sessions next finally
we have the start session command as the
name suggests the start session command
is used to start a new logical session
in the mongodb database now the
constraint here is you must be
authenticated to run this command that
is proper authentication should be given
to the mongodb database otherwise it
does not enforce
so if the deployment does not have any
uh authentication or authorization a
created uh has no owner and can be used
by any user over any connection
so these were some of the types of
session commas that we use so let's just
get into detail with each of the command
here so the first one is what is about
transaction command
so the about transaction uh command or
the method tells mongodb to undo all the
modifications made throughout the
transaction and restore the database to
its initial configuration
so it basically terminates all the
multi-document transaction and rolls
back any changes made by the operations
within the transaction that is the
transaction basically ends without
saving any of the changes made by the
operations in the transaction now the
award transaction command must be run
within a session and run against the
admin database only and another
constraint is it will terminate any
transaction before it can get executed
because one of the operation caused an
error so to run the about transaction
the command must be uh run against the
admin database and run with the start
session initially
so let us understand the Syntax for this
the syntax is followed as DB dot admin
command and within the brackets mention
about transaction and we are given a
Boolean value that is 1 that means true
next we have the transaction number it
can be of any type I'm just specifying
the long next we have the right concern
mention the document name and then I'm
giving Auto commit to false next we have
any comments if you want to uh display
in for the reason why you are aborting
the transaction you can specify it here
so when a transaction Awards all the
data changes all the data changes made
by the right transactions are discarded
without ever being visible to the
visible and the transaction eventually
ends automatically
next we have the what is commit
transaction command now commit
transaction ends the transaction by
saving the changes made by the
operations in the multi-level document
transaction so you can say this is
basically an opposite of about
transaction command which will basically
ensure that it saves the changes made by
the operations in the multi-document
transaction and nset transaction as well
so again you are to run the commit
transaction you must run it against the
admin database using the DB dot admin
command so the transaction is same again
which is similar to that of the about
transaction instead of about transaction
mention the commit transaction keyword
here and specify it as one and the rest
all the fields where you have the
transaction number write concern uh
autocommit comment will all have the
same uh you know criteria so the right
concern basically uh tells you that when
committing any transaction the session
uses the right concern on specified if
the transaction start
so let's say when a transaction commands
and all the data changes made in the
transaction are saved and visible
outside the transaction which which
means a transaction will not commit some
of its changes while rolling back the
other changes so until and unless a
transaction commits the data changes
made in the transaction are not visible
to any user outside of the transaction
so I hope you were clear with the
comment transaction next we have the
what is end sessions command
so basically n session expires the
sessions that are specified now the
overwrites the timeout window that the
sessions wait before closing now what do
I mean by that
so this method basically closes an
existing session so if a transaction was
Associated within this a session the
transaction will get uh aborted once you
uh you know give this n session command
so after calling this method application
should not invoke any other commands on
this session anymore so let us
understand the syntax the syntax is
followed as DB dot run command and
within the parenthesis I am giving the
end sessions keyword and inside that I
am mentioning ID where you have to give
the uuid now guid is basically and you
know alt uh alter uh you know
specification for you know object ID we
have in mongodb so mongodb and other
mongodb drivers come with this inbuilt
support for the uuid data type and it's
very easy and convenient to start using
the uuid immediately as well
so it basically mongodb itself stores uu
IDs as a binary field and when such
binary fields are accessed from software
mongodb drivers usually convert their
value which is found uh in the database
to language specific uh you know uuid
objects so that is just an opposite of
I'm not an opposite I can say it is an
alternative uh to the use of object ID
in mongodb
so that is what in session is all about
next we have the what is kill all
session command now killing a session
terminates any in progress operations in
the section session so we haven't
discussed what exactly why we are using
kill uh keyword here so the mongodb
takes this command in order to terminate
any ongoing process or the operations in
that session
so the kill all session commands kill
all the uh you know sessions that are
being run on the mongodb database and if
access control is enabled the command
only kills the SEC sessions that are
owned by the user so let us now
understand the syntax now
we have uh you know kill sessions as
well uh as in addition to kill all
sessions so the basic or the generic
type of syntax that we write here is DB
dot run command inside that we are
specifying kill all sessions and you can
either give a particular user and the
database name wherein the command takes
an array of documents that specify the
uuid portion of the session ID or else
what you can do is you can just simply
run the DB dot run command where you are
just specifying kill all sessions which
will automatically terminate all the
operations in the in that particular
session and if you want a particular
only uh specific type of uh session in
that case you have to mention the user
and the DB Associated to it so let's say
I have uh this uh two users right I just
want to uh
stop only these two sessions right in
that case I'm using DB dot run command
kill all sessions and I'm just giving
the username and the DP so Rohan one is
the user and the DB that is working on
is employee one so it will basically
termite all the sessions or the
transactions that are ongoing that is if
you are performing any read or write
operations on this it will terminate all
the sessions in one code
next we have what is kill all by session
all sessions by pattern now as the name
suggests we are basically stopping all a
particular session with the help of a
specified pattern here which is the
definition of this command is the kill
all session by pattern command kills all
sessions that match any of the specified
pattern now the syntax is also similar
to that of kill all sessions which is DB
dot run command and inside the
parenthesis we are giving the keyword
kill all sessions by pattern and mention
the pattern here now there are various
patterns that are associated uh with
this so you can either have any of the
four choices that you can see in the
table here now the first one basically
specifies the uuid portion of the
session ID that you want to terminate
next you can just give the uid or and
give the bin data which will basically
specifies the hash of the owner of the
session to kill next you can just give
the uh you can just specify the owner of
the session you know to kill or to
terminate that session which will
require additional privileges
and finally you can also terminate a
session by just giving the role to that
database so if you specify the role
assigned to the owner of that session in
order to stop it you can just give to
that a particular role as well which
will again require additional privileges
now what I mean by additional privileges
here is that so if the database that
you're working on enforces any
authentication or authorization you must
have the kill any session or kill all
session privilege action in order to run
the kill all session by pattern command
so only in such case you can use this
type of command which is skill all
section by command if you have the
permission of kill all session command
so that is what uh kill all session my
pattern command is all about
and with that we have come to the end of
today's session guys I think we have
discussed pretty much about all the uh
session commands that we use now in
terms of
working on mongodb database it is not uh
um important topic to uh you know learn
it is just an uh conceptual topic maybe
you might be asked in your interview
questions but in general if you're
working on a database you might not use
uh more of the session commands so it is
important to uh have a knowledge a
pretty much knowledge on what are the
session commands and what is the basic
significance on why we use in our
mongodb database what is backup and
restore in mongodb and how to implement
in real life so we will walk you through
the steps of backing up and restoring
process in mongodb database and also the
collection present in them so firstly
let us discuss what is backup in general
before we understand how backup Works in
mongodb now backup and Recovery refers
the process of creating and storing data
copies that can be used to protect any
organization or companies when they have
any data loss so this is referred also
to as operational loss and recovering
from a data from a backup usually
Intel's restoring the data to its
original location or that is copying of
data in other location where it can be
used in place of the lost or damaged
data now to protect D against data loss
due to primary Hardware or any software
failures a proper backup copy stored in
a separate system or a medium like hard
disk or pen drive from the primary data
now data should be backed up at regular
intervals because it is important that
you have the access to the data Within
the data should be backed up in no text
so that you can access that data in
whatever uh you know situation you want
and it also determined by how frequently
the data changes and depending upon that
you have to backup your data it might be
every week every month or maybe once in
a quarter or like that
so moving ahead just like uh the backup
which we do for other systems as well
mongodb also requires backup since it is
a nosql database and it works a lot on
non-structured data which has large data
sets and in order to ensure that the
customer the user's information is
stored properly and their identity and
their data is safeguarded it is
important that we uh you know back up
the data into our mongodb database so
for that mongodb provides with various
inbuilt tools for example thump as
well as mongodist store commands which
is used to connect the mongodb instance
on a local system and create a database
backup named dump in the current
directory now we'll understand how it
works when we get into the execution
part so for now just just understand
how does mongodb backup works now now
there are various ways in which you can
backup your data in mongodb so if you're
working on mongodb Atlas you can use
so mongodb Atlas which is the hosted
mongodb service option in the cloud
offers basically two types of methods
for backups which is cloud backup as
well as Legacy backup next we have the
mongodb cloud manager and ops manager
now mongodb Cloud manager is a hosted
backup monitoring and automation service
for mongodb the mongodb cloud manager
supports the backing up and restoring of
mongodb deployments so mongodb Cloud
manager generally backups mongodb
replica sets and sharded clusters by
reading the op log data from your
mongodb deployment and next we have the
basic tools like dump which is an
easier way let's say if you are trying
to backup data which is less than a 100
GB of 500 GB in such case Monger dump
which is a inbuilt command tool is a
great option for you and finally we also
have file system backups where you can
create a backup of a mongodb deployment
by making a copy of mongodb's underlying
data files so the volume where mongodb
sources data file supports point in time
you can use this uh file system backup
you want to create backup of a mongodb
system at an exact moment in that time
so in this tutorial we are only
concerned with the mongodum and we'll
see how it works
so to create backup of a database or a
collection you should use mongodom
command let's see how the syntax is now
the syntax is simple you just have to
write mongodum and again let's
understand this when we get into the
execution part so if you want to uh
backup only a particular database or
let's say a particular collection in
such case the syntax would be dump
mention DB and the database name next
mention collection keyword and their
collection name and after that mention
out and the location path of it so in
this way you can use this command in
order to backup a particular database
and a collection name so mongodum is an
ideal backup solution for let's say
small mongodb instances due to its ease
of use and portability
I hope you understood you know what is
backup and uh how does it work in
mongodb so let us now jump into
execution part and see how it is done
we'll also see how to uh once we backup
our database and after deleting or
dropping the database of the collection
how to restore it back to its original
uh position in the database as well
so what you have to do is you have to
basically first open command prompt and
before we get in ahead with the
execution pattern how to backup our
mongodb database you have to install the
mongod dump which is a command line
which is an inbuilt command line so what
you have to do is you have to uh go and
download
the data which is the command lines from
the mongodb official server so for that
what you have to do is type mongodb
command lines database tools all right
so scroll down a bit and you'll have
this download mongodb command line
database tools click on that
and you can see that we have this
mongodb command line database tools
download and all the description on this
I will file the latest version of it and
you will have the package ZIP here just
uh
remove that and select MSI package and
click on download now I've already
downloaded it on my system so I'll just
show you what has to be done
so when you download it it will ask for
uh
the setup just give the permission
necessary permissions and all
so as I've already installed it says you
can change the features I have installed
repair here just click the next button
until you finish it okay
now once you're done with that it will
basically store the data in the C drive
so go to program files in C drive
and open mongodb folder and in that it
will be downloaded in tools section so
click on this tools you'll have this 100
click on bin so this is where we have
the all database tools for example based
on dumb mongodb expert files
 import restore mongostat and
 top so this is how you have to
download the basic command line tool
which is which since you are working
with mongodum which is a part of a
command line tool we are downloading
this so all right so once you are done
with this now go back to our Command
Prompt and next type mongoose
which is basically directed to our
shell all right so let's just get
started I'm using the show TBS command
here so it says various uh shows the
various databases present in our uh
mongodb database right all right now now
you can now you can work on the existing
database or you can create a new
database in order to backup the data
that is present in that so let's say I'm
just using a new database here let's say
the database name is mongodb backup
okay so it says switch to DB
backup so let us now just create a set
of collections okay for example we'll
create two collections so the first
collection would be orders right so I'm
just creating collections DB dot orders
insert and inside that I'm basically uh
just creating a field let's say let's
take a name let's say Rohan
okay
so this is this is just for example guys
I'm just showing a basic example so that
you'll have a clear idea on how the
backup works here so similarly let's
just create another collection let's say
customers
Dot
insert
and let's say take the name as Rahul
right close the brackets
well as you can see in the assertion
tool we can see that it is successfully
acknowledged true and it is inserted IDs
are also created so let us just uh use
the show collections command whether or
not they have created or not so you can
see customers and orders are the two
collections that are created inside the
mongodb backup
now once we're done with this we have to
create a path or let's say a folder
wherein we are trying to backup the data
that is present in our mongodb database
so for that what you have to do is go to
let's say C drive and just create a
folder let's say I am creating a new
folder here
let's take the name of the folder as
backup Okay click on that
now click on there open the backup
folder now you will see that folder is
empty now now since we haven't done any
backup on our database it will show this
folder as empty now what you have to do
is just copy this uh address okay just
double click over here and just copy the
address now
now once again open command prompt
all right
now we have to set the path to our
location which is the see the where you
have created the backup folder so for
that I'm using the CD which means
current directory and just copy paste
the uh location that we have just copied
okay which is the C backup file now
click ok now it is change to C backup
now we have to set up the path for our
backup file right now for that I'm using
the set path
so we have to set path for our mongodom
Command which is uh basically stored in
I think
the program files again just go there
click on program files click on mongodb
click on tools click on this open bin
and just copy paste this address over
here
copy
just open this and within the brackets
inverted comma sorry I'll paste this
click ok now that means you have
successfully uh set up the path for your
mongodum command wherein the data that
you have created in your mongodb
database that is the mongodb database
and that we have created two collection
side which is orders and customer will
now be backed up now for that you have
to just simply use the dump
keyword
and click enter so it will just process
and it says done dumping simply code one
dot new employees and all all right so
let's just go back to our
folder here and see whether or not we
have created a backup right so where you
can see the backup and inside backup now
we have a dump folder and inside that we
have all the database names which is
admin company DB mongodb backup simply
code one student DB test we have
recently created this mongodb backup
click on that and you can see we have
the data in the form of Json format
which is of customers as well as the
orders so that means you have
successfully copied the data from your
mongodb instance to your local uh system
wherein you have downloaded the data
from the database and you have inserted
you have basically backed up into this
folder here
so I hope you understood how to uh
basically perform the backup in your
mongodb database so let's say if I want
to drop this database so let's see how
does it work for that I'm using the
db.drop database command
make sure the D is capital otherwise it
will throw an error
so is it uh it says it is successfully
uh dropped the mongodb backup database
so let's again see the collections I
mean show DBS let's see if it is showing
or not so as you can see mongodb backup
is not there
in our uh you know list of uh the
databases that we are that have that are
available now
so we have to perform the restore option
here so for that I'll just go back uh to
the command prompt and I'll just simply
write restore
click enter it will process and it will
take some time
and finally you can see in the end of uh
the line here it says two documents
restored successfully so let's just go
back and let us now see
whether it is showing the mongodb backup
database or not so now you can see
mongodb backup is present in our list of
databases that are present in our
mongodb instance so again let's check
whether the collections have uh backed
up or not so for that I'm showing I'm
writing show collections command here so
as you can see customers and orders are
restored again backwards original state
without any uh issues over here so in
this way you can use the restore option
if you are in case you have deleted your
database or let's say deleted the
information or the data from your
collections that are present in your
database
so till now we are basically backed up
all the collections that are present in
a database now what if you want to
create a backup of only a particular
collection now let's say I have the
customers collection here and I want to
only backup that and leave the orders so
for that we have to basically again go
back to our C drive and we'll just
create another file here okay
and the folder wherein will take let's
say backup one so we have created a new
backup one folder just copy paste this
foreign
copy paste this and
go back to the command prompt
and now mention the current directory
which we are using is backup one all
right
so sensor basically uh backup backing up
only a particular folder now the command
would be dump
mentioned the DB database which is
mongodb backup
and mention the collection keyword and
mention the collection name which is
customers I think it's customers only
let's just yeah it's customers
so when you click on enter it will say
that done dumping mongodb backup dot
customers one document has been
successfully packed up so let's just
verify it go back to backup one so you
can see
now only the customers collection was
only uh backed up in our let's say which
we have created backup one folder now
I'll drop this only the particular uh
collection and will try to restore it
back to our its original state so the
command would be DB dot mention the uh
collection name and mention the drop
keyword
so it says true that means it is
successfully uh dropped so let's just
check the collections and see whether it
is deleted or not so you can see only
orders uh collection has is been shown
in our uh you know database which is in
mongodb backup database all right so let
us now try to restore it uh just go back
to this command prompt and now the
keyword would be restore
in the same restore DB is the
keyword mentioned the database name
which is mongodb backup and mention the
collection name as well
just customers
Okay click enter
let's say zero scanning files can file
dump is a directory not a piece on file
okay you have to provide the file path
also so I think I've
so let me just correct this uh just copy
paste the command till here
now what you have to do is you have to
provide the location of the backup
folder where you have created the backup
for the customers collection here so
just copy paste this
so I'm just mentioning the location of
where we have backed up our you know
customers collection here and it is also
saying that it is not a base one file
right so just keep the Slash and mention
the collection name and the file format
which is based on okay and I think we
are good to go now just click enter
so now you can see that uh one document
restored successfully so let's just go
back to the mongodb shell and try to
verify whether it is restored or not so
I'm just creating again show collections
uh command so now you can see customers
order and the orders are both showing in
our collection set so that means we are
successfully restored the one which we
have deleted so in this way you can even
delete uh and backup and restore a
particular database collection as well
PHP with mongodb will understand how to
use mongodb with the help of PHP now
after the initial driver setup we'll
continue explaining how to get started
with mongodb driver and use and how to
use the extension driver which
corresponds to various libraries in PHP
to create collection in our mongodb
database using PHP
now before we get to the execution part
of how to use mongodb with PHP let us
quickly understand what is PHP now PHP
is a common open source scripting
language popular for web applications
also uh it originally stood for personal
home page PHP is now a recursive acronym
for hypertext preprocessor
foreign
scripting language which is embedded in
HTML in its simplest form and it allows
web developers to create Dynamic content
and interact with databases PHP is known
for its Simplicity speed and flexibility
and many other features that made it a
Cornerstone in a web development mode
now more than 80 percent of all the
websites rely on PHP to some degree
making it one of the most favorite
languages among programmers and web
developers and PHP is used on most uh
some of the most prominent web
properties and platforms using uh
including Facebook Wikipedia WordPress
and many other more so I hope you
understood what is PHP so let us now
move and understand why we use PHP
now there are some major benefits of
learning PHP now one such uh you know
factor is it's an open source language
now just like any other databases like
MySQL which is available to users
directly on the internet similarly PHP
is also is freely available to use and
Implement without any problem
it is also an easy to learn language
since it is very similar to how HTML
codes are written so if you have a
prerequisite knowledge on how HTML works
now the same the similar codes are
written in the same manner in PHP and it
is easy to understand and Implement as
well it is also highly compatible since
it can be integrated with multiple
programming languages such as HTML
JavaScript and also supports different
databases uh with by giving an extension
like MySQL post SQL Oracle and nosql
database like momodb as well
it is a platform independent uh you know
uh database which means that
applications developing using PHP can
run in environment also finally it has a
large community of developers and that
is programming is all about helping and
being help right so a large community
would be would mean that you can have an
instant help whenever you are stuck with
any problem using PHP
so I hope you understood why we use PHP
let us now move ahead and understand
quickly how does PHP work now PHP uh
being a server-side language as I said
earlier the entire workflow is on his
server itself so basically we have a PHP
interpreted which is installed into the
server to check the PHP files now while
on the client side the only requirement
is a browser an inter internet
connection so if you look at this
diagram here we have a client a server
and a DOT PHP file so basically the
client is requesting the web page on the
browser so the server where the PHP
software is installed then checks for
the dot PHP file associated with the
request so whenever it's if it finds
this file it sends the file to the PHP
interpreter okay since PHP as we
discussed there is an interpreted
language which checks were requested
data into the database and then if you
look at the step 3 Where The Interpreter
then send backs the requested data
output as an HTML web page since a
browser does not understand a PHP dot
file
and once it's done the web server
receives the HTML file from The
Interpreter in Step 4 and finally and it
sends the web page back to the browser
so this is what the complete flow of how
PHP works
so let us now move ahead and discuss uh
in detail like in a nutshell how exactly
uh this is being done on uh you know on
the server side so PHP program
communicates with the site server which
is responsible for sending web pages to
the rest of the world so for example
when you type any URL in your web
browser address bar like if you're
searching for Google or YouTube you are
basically instructing the web server at
the URL to email you an HTML file and in
response the web server sends the
requested file now yeah your browser
reads the HTML file and displays the web
page so whenever you click on the source
link on the web page you are also
requesting a file from the web server
and in addition when you click a web
page button now that submits a form a
file which is again processed by the web
server and this procedure is the same
when you are using with PHP also PHP
interpreter interprets the script to
access the specific data as requested
from the user then the server Returns
the HTML page according according to the
requirement so this is in a nutshell how
PHP works
now the main agenda of this session is
how to use PHP with mongodb right so
mongodb server is built to already work
with your current web server but not
with PHP so in order to work with uh
mongodb database using PHP you are going
to need a PHP mover driver which is an
extension library now apart from that we
need uh certain other you know uh you
know factors in order to use PHP with
mongodb
so before attempting to set up a
connection between PHP and mongodb now a
few essential prerequisites needs to be
taken care of so basically you need a
dll file which is basically a dynamic
link Library which can be found on
Google which I'll be showing in a while
when we get to the installation process
wherein we'll be setting up a PHP and
mongodb connection by installing the
mongodb PHP driver on our system and
also we need uh you either you need to
make sure that either exam or Vamp is
already installed and configured on your
system so Zam we are going to use zamp
and this which is basically used to set
up your local web browser and also we
need to have composer which will
basically connect the PHP command line
with our uh you know mongodb database so
we'll get into the execution part in a
while I hope you understood till now are
the basics of why of what is PHP and why
it is used and how it is related uh with
databases and how you can perform
operations by connecting databases like
MySQL and mongodb so without any further
delay next let us jump into the
installation process and we'll see how
to uh how we need the PHP mongodb
mongodb driver all right let us now
discuss how to set up the mongodb
connection with PHP and in order to
install the mongodb PHP driver on our
system we need the extension uh you know
driver files right for that we will use
the peace here now pecl is basically uh
as you can see it's a repository for PHP
extensions which provides the hosting
facility for downloading and development
of PHP extension now since we want uh
for the PHP and mongodb right so we'll
just enter PHP mongodb
so you can see uh the first result click
on that where you can see the package
mongodb pecl
it will redirect to uh to you to a page
and you can see various versions that
are available to download but we need
dll file here so you can see we have a
dll and the windows symbol here right
and also 1.13 is also the latest version
so we'll be downloading that click on
dll
uh now scroll down a bit now you will
find the different types of dll list
here which is PHP 8.1 PHP 8.0 PHP 7.4
now we need uh the we have also
different files here which is non-trade
safe thread safe and uh you know not
that safe 86 and all so since Windows
has a 64-bit configuration and we will
use this thread safe uh option here so
click on this which is the latest
version it will download
uh depending upon your internet speed uh
it may take some miles or less wait for
some time oh it is downloaded now so in
this uh in this file we can see various
different you know options we can have
we have this PHP mongodb.dll which is
basically the application extension in
order to connect mongodb with PHP so
basically we'll copy this all right now
the next step uh we are going to do is
go back to Google Chrome and now we have
to download zamp
now we all know that PHP is the most
popular and widely used server-side
scripting language for web development
right so but however it requires a web
server to run even a locally developed
web page so now there are various web
server software for setting up on a
local web server among them PHP zamp and
Vamp server are the most popular so we
are going to use Zam which is a
cross-platform application that can run
on a Windows uh Linex and Mac OS
operating system so let us now uh
uh try to install this amp on our system
so in the search box type exam which is
the zxamp
so you can see this which is developed
by the Apache friends uh you can see in
the dialog box here also what it is it
is developed by Apache friends
consisting meaning of the mainly of
Apache HTTP server Maria database and
interprets for scripts written in PHP
and pearl programming language so you
can see the download option here click
on that
now again we have different uh
configuration and download options for
various operating systems that are using
so if you're using xam for Windows we
have three different versions of it
similarly for Linux for OS also we have
so since we are installing it our
windows we are only concerned with this
and we have the latest version of it
which is 8.1.2 so we'll be installing
that on our system so click on download
64-bit
so we have successfully uh downloaded
that just wait for some time to install
it on your system it may take a while
again uh depending upon internet and uh
so let's just wait for it to download
in the meantime guys if you're finding
this tutorial informative and helpful
make sure to leave a like and share it
with your friends and colleagues also so
that it will reach uh to most of the
people you know who are learning PHP and
mongodb and if even if there's someone
who is at a bigger level who is trying
to learn something new it will be quite
helpful so make sure you uh you know
share it with as many as people for a
better reach
so as you can see we have successfully
uh downloaded the zamp on our system and
then uh once you after the download if
you click the file it will open in this
way which is uh for an anti-virus
running you can uh I will ask for
continue with installation just click on
yes
now you have this setup page for the Zam
uh just click on next
so basically all these files will be uh
you know installed on your system like
MySQL filezilla FTP server page my admin
so these are all the various components
that you get quite handy also when you
again you are installing this app on
your system so click on next so it will
ask to save
the location on which you want to save
your razam folder so it is basically
saving in a C drive click on next header
for this which says the selected folder
is not empty please select a different
folder so now I've already installed
this amp on my folder I'll just uh go
through the uh you know technique on how
to overcome this warning so let's just
go to the Zam folder
on our system
so if you're facing that issue uh just
basically delete all the uh you know
files that is already if you have a
folder named as Zam just delete all the
files in that or else you can change the
location from this also so I'm now
taking uh the location as desktop here
so click on next it will ask for
language preference click on next again
and setup is now ready to begin
installing uh example in a computer just
click on next and it will automatically
uh complete your setup and installation
so just search for it and it will
directly open if you have already
installed uh as you can see in the Zam
control panel you have various services
and modules like Apache MySQL filezilla
Mercury tomcat and Etc
foreign
next we'll be installing composer now we
need a tool which can be used to install
libraries as well as manage application
dependencies and for that composer does
a great job for uh you know application
Level package manner for PHP which has
gained immense popularity and it also
became you know the standard managing
dependency in PHP application so you can
save PHP uh you can say composer is
basically a dependency manage tool which
allows you to declare the libraries your
project depends on and it will manage
them for you on your system so again
let's go to Google and type composer
so you can also know what exactly
composer it from the dialog box here so
just click on composer so you'll find
this pager and you'll also have a
download option click on that
now scroll down a bit
uh no need to scroll down so you can see
download and run composer setup.exe just
click on that
so it will uh yeah it is successfully
downloaded now let's just click on this
file and we'll install it on our system
so once it's installed on your system
we'll have this setup page which will
ask for you know a developer mode it's
your wish if you want to click on
developer mode so let's just leave it
like that click on next next you have to
choose the path command line which you
want to use in order to execute the PHP
or commands on your system so make sure
that the file is PHP dot exe and if it
is not there you just have to go to the
xam file which you have installed it on
our system
uh just go to Zam
uh you have PHP
and down you have php.exe so make sure
it is uh being saved on this path and
not on the other part click on next
so it's checking for the command line
and it has successfully chosen the uh
command line so click on just and click
on install okay and this is how you can
download the composite setup
so it will just run the composable
install setup script like wait for it
some time to complete the installation
process
so it says that as a last installed you
may need to restart your system so click
on that and restart your system once
again
so we have also successfully uh you know
installed compost on our system so let's
just wrap up what you have done till now
we have basically added the mongodb
driver extension using the pacl uh
command uh which you have again
downloaded on system next you have
downloaded exam next we have also
installed composer on our system now let
us understand how to configure PHP in a
way that will allow a connection to
mongodb in the windows environment now
we have uh downloaded a file from you
know pacl command line right which is
which is PHP underscore mongodb.dll so
just copy this file and now go to Zam
get stored in C drive right so click on
the Zam folder click on PHP and in PHP
you will find EXT folder and click on
that
and paste it over here
all right so as you can see I have
pasted the PHP
mongodb.dll file on my system
now next you have to search for PHP dot
ini file in order to uh you know paste
the extension for the mongodb database
so just search for PHP ini in the search
box I think we have here itself so you
have php.in development
php.infroduction now in some cases you
will directly find PHP dot ini file or
else you'll find in this way so make
sure that it is just the file which is
above the PHP dot ini development file
as in this case so click on this
now you will find a series of extension
here which is saved in the notepad
so you need to basically add the
following file with the extension so
search for the extension uh you know
files have just scroll down a bit slowly
you'll find it I think
let's scroll down more a bit or else you
can just search for all right we have
got the file here so now what you need
to do is you have to basically I have
already installed it my on my system
right so I'm just showcasing you know
how to do it again so you have this
extension dot PHP so beforehand you
won't have this so you have to write
type extension and just paste the file
which is PHP
mongodb.dll and you have to save the
file now saving the file is must
otherwise it will not reflect in your
system
so I think we are good to go now we have
successfully installed the mongodb
extension driver in our system now we
are good to go and we can write the uh
code on our PHP line now you can use any
sort of editor for writing the PHP code
be it notepad date subline text or even
visual code so firstly let us run the uh
you know Zam file will run the Apache
system
so as you can see it is successfully
started now all the data that has been
uh you know written or configured is
stored in the Local Host so if you press
localhost
and before that we need to create uh you
know a folder on which we are working
because uh it will basically tell or
where the data is being stored so go to
bizamp again
exam and then you will file HT dots now
in this you can create a new folder now
I already created a new folder which is
new.mongodb you can create a new folder
again as well so let's just create uh
another one here
click on new folder
so let's say it has
mongodb PHP all right
so click on this it says folder as empty
now if you want to find what is
happening in this you have to basically
go to uh Web search type localhost slash
and mention the folder name which you
have taken that is mongodb PHP again put
the backslash and enter so as you can
see we have a index of mongodb PHP here
and there is no files yet that is saved
here right now we'll write a basic
program Now using the PHP now for that
you need a prior knowledge on HTML
because the code written is PHP is also
similar to that
so I'm going to use the notepad only for
my editor so just open the notepad
now this might be a bit confusing
because I am using uh the PHP you know
commands so it might be a bit confusing
so just understand how it is going and
how it is working actually
so first we have to provide the header
file which is given by greater than
symbol and question mark and write PHP
and again in the end we basically have a
question mark and the greater than
symbol again 2 in order to close the tag
now in between we have to write our uh
you know code for in order to create a
new collection in our mongodb database
so firstly I am going to uh gives the
necessary actions which is required
to enter the window
slash authorized
sorry auto load
dot PHP all right close it mention
semicolon and then you have to provide
the client connection right now what we
are doing is we are basically connecting
robot DB with database now in general we
have the local host of mongodb is 27017
so that is what we will be connecting so
the Syntax for that is dollar sign
client
is equals to
you
 DB
backslash client
make sure DC is uh Capital otherwise it
will throw an error here
and
and open the square brackets mention
double quotes
provide the location which is mongodb
colon
backslash localhost
which is 270
1 7.
now if you want to know what is your
local OS connection you can just simply
open mongodb shell and you can see it
mongodb compulsory you can see that what
the localhost name is there on your
system that is installed so let's
connect it so as you can see we have
localhost is 27017 which is almost uh
same for most of the system I reckon so
let's just get back to our code again
here
now I'm going to create a database now
let's say uh
company
I'm going to take the database name as
company DB
okay
company DB
and then I'm going to write client
mention the database name which is again
company TV
all right next I am going to create a
collection now for that we have to use
the tag which is dollar Result One okay
so mention the database that you have
chosen which is company DB
or mention the arrow symbol now write
the keyword which is create collection
make sure the C is capital otherwise it
will throw an error okay
you can give only collection email so
let's take employee collection so I'm
giving it as employee collection as an
example here all right so let's just
close it again
then
you have to store this value all right
it's not just you have created uh
anything you have just created a
collection now in order to store this
you are you have to use character here
well done and save the result now we
have taken uh our you know object as
result one right so just write the value
which is result 1.
so this is basically our code uh which
is basically a beginner level code on
how to create a database by connecting
it to the mongodb database and then we
are creating a collection employee dot
collection so let us just save this file
on our system so give it a name let's
say mongodb one
dot PHP make sure it is of the extension
dot PHP file and select all files and it
should be stored in your uh you know
folder that you have created which is
mongodb dot PHP so this should be saved
in this folder click on save all right
so let us now go to the localhost and
see whether it is created or not
localhost
uh
the folder name that you have given is
mongodb PHP right click on that so as
you can see we have a new file which is
momodb1.ph which is created
uh it is seeing an error one second so
there was a small level in the code I
just rectified now when you click on uh
so let's just type again uh search for
it search the folder that you have saved
now if you click that you have uh
you know like this which says that
object mongodb model based on document
storage add object private array1 okay
dotford which means that is it means
that you have successfully created the
uh you know document as well as
collection in your mongodb database so
let's just verify by going into our
database and see whether it is created
or not just refresh it and you can see
that we have a new company DB uh you
know document and that we in that we
have created a collection name which is
AMD collection and it is reflecting also
if you want to check anymore DB shell
also you can just cross verify it
uh so let us uh write the command show
TVs so that you can have an idea on
which collections we have so as you can
see even in the mongodb Shell command
line and also we have company DB which
is reflecting in our output so if you
use the company DB
it will say switch to TB company DB and
then let's say if you want to see the
collection that are present in that so
you can see EMD collection is reflecting
in that so we have successfully created
a document and collection using the PHP
that is we have used the mongodb driver
extension and we have written the script
in uh in PHP format so now whatever you
are hosting the application that you are
hosting on your web page all the data is
also simultaneously stored in the
mongodb database so this is how you can
create a database and collection using
PHP so in this tutorial we have just
covered on uh the basics on how to
install and configure the mongodb driver
extensions and how to create a basic uh
document and collection in this a
session so stay tuned for the next
tutorial where we'll try to insert some
uh Fields into our collection that we
have created the fact that Java is one
of the top most programming languages in
the world is due the fact that it has
some of the most robust and tactical
features Java is a modern Cutting Edge
and ever-evolving Computing language
that combines An Elegant language design
with powerful features that were not
available in other languages which
include many powerful supporting
software libraries for tasks such as
database applications networking and
graphical user interface programming and
did you know that we can use mongodb to
store our data with the help of java we
know that mongodb is a nosql database
and it is a developer data platform that
is compatible with several languages
including Java which is a great fit for
applications which are written in
mongodb mongodb provides connectivity
for Java client applications using the
Java driver so firstly what is Java
Java is a multi-platform objected
oriented programmed languages that runs
on billions of devices worldwide
currently it Powers applications
smartphone operating systems Enterprise
software and many well-known programs so
it is basically used to design and
develop application software and other
critical software Frameworks now the use
cases of java has been a prominent in
many sectors it can be extremely trans
used as a transferable programming
language used across platforms and
different types of devices from
smartphones to Smart TVs it's used for
creating mobile and web apps
it can also be used in other sectors
like gaming big data and cloud-based
applications and other uh specifications
as well so now in order to integrate uh
mongodb with Java you don't need a high
programming skills and you know much
knowledge on Java you just need basic
level understanding of java and its
syntax so before we get into the
execution part you need the three basic
uh things you know that you want to
perform with mongodb and Java connection
is you need to have a mongodb that is
installed on your device and then you
need to have Java development kit which
is a jdk and then IDE which is an
eclipse now mongodb installation is
important uh wherein we'll connect the
 client which access the interface
between our Java program and the mongodb
server so it is basically used to create
a connection which is used to connect
all the relevant databases and retrieve
collection names which are present in
our DB database into our Js platform it
is basically used to perform credit
operations like create read update
delete operations on our Collections and
documents next we are using a jdk jdk is
nothing but the uh compiler or the
source where you write the code which is
a software development environment that
offers a collection of tools and Repro
repositories or libraries which are
necessary for developing any Java
applications so if you're integrating
mongodb with Java you need certain
dependencies or certain let's say uh
libraries that you need to connect in
order to perform mongodb operations so
for that we are using Maven Maven is
basically used for Java based projects
which helps in downloading all the
dependencies if you are integrating uh
one language with another uh to a
database I can I you can also include
libraries and jar files also
and finally you need an integrated
development environment that is an IDE
so we are using eclipse for this eclipse
is basically a free Java based
development platform that allows
developer to develop and test code
written in other programming languages
so I hope you understood the basic
concept on how we integrate mongodb with
Java so let us now just get into the
execution part and see how it is
executed so we have already installed
mongodb on our device uh for now we'll
be just installing the ID which is the
eclipse and the jdk now you know in
order to install jdk you just have to go
to Google type Java Oracle
and on the home page you will find this
uh this login to that
and on the right side on the topmost
corner you can see download Java which
is basically the latest version is Java
19 so you just have to click download
Java
and if you scroll down you have the
various download options we are
downloading the 19th which is the
current version and we want it for
Windows and we are installing for the
64-bit so just click on this and it will
automatically download now I have
already downloaded it on my system so
just wait for the installation process
to complete and give the necessary
permissions and click on finish finally
so we have successfully downloaded Java
on our device now let's see if it is
downloaded or not go to the uh
C drive and go to program files and you
can see we have a folder named Java
click on that so as you can see that we
have the latest version which is jdk 19
go to bin folder and this is where we
have all the repositories or the
important files of the jdk program now
what you have to do is you have to set
the path for that just click on this and
copy paste everything
and what you have to do is you have to
paste it in the uh system environment
variables
so it is mandatory to add the path to
the system variable but now by default
most of the programs will add their own
custom Shortcuts To the windows
environment variables so the most used
environment will variable in Windows is
probably the path variable so it
basically allows you to run any
executable commands that are located
inside the path specified in the
variable at the command prompt without
having to give the full path to the
executable command so instead of
you know compiling the ways to add the
directory to the path each and every
time anyone working on Java or the jdk
you can just simply add the path to the
environmental variable so once you are
done with that just come back and let us
now download the eclipse also
so I just have to click Eclipse Java
so the first page you can see Eclipse ID
for Java developers you can also find
the information on the right side of it
so let's just download the latest
version of it so as you can see uh the
latest version is Eclipse ID 2012 dual
2022 12 click on download X
and again it will show the version just
click on download and it will finally
get downloaded
so give the necessary permissions again
guys I've already installed it on my
system so this is just for reference so
once it's downloaded you are good to go
so once you download it it will be it
will show you and just type eclipse in
the search box as you can see
and when you try to open it it will ask
for a selected director as a workspace
now this is by default just keep this as
it is and launch
so I've chosen this
so once you click on launch you will
find this uh final navigation page
wherein we'll have to create a Java
project now now as discussed earlier
we'll be creating a maven project which
is used to add dependencies to a Java
driver in order to connect mongodb and
uh Java together so I'll just you know
click on go to file click on new and we
have the other option here click on
Maven project and click on text
and tick the box which is create a
simple project click on next again now
you can need to give a group ID and an
artifact ID you know it can be of any
name so let's just say I am taking it as
Java and let's just copy paste it
again here
it should be same otherwise it will show
an error so I'm just creating a new
Maven project with name Java click
on finish
okay it says that we have already
created Java
just create another one let's take one
so I have already created uh you know
Maven project of that name Java so
I'm just changing the name and creating
it as Java node so just double
click on that now you can see various uh
you know types of specifications that we
get into this project it says the main
variant you have to write your code here
and the resources test resources and
then you have JD system Library SRC
Target and next we have the pom Excel
XML file is where you add the
dependencies now we are working with
mongodb and we are trying to integrate
with a Java application right so for
that you need to install the necessary
Java drivers and Maven which is a
Project based will give an access by
providing various dependencies to our
mongodb and Java driver so the
Syntax for that would be just it's a
normal syntax just follow this you can
even pause once it's done
so the syntax is followed as
open the
syntax as dependencies
and inside that you have to basically
again give the tag as dependency
the computer is already showing for you
again close that and it will also have
the end tag now you have to basically
give the group ID that you have created
for the maven project so it is also
giving the group ID for us
so I'll just take uh the group now you
have to mention as org Dot mongodb
so you can see it is Auto uh you know
pasting for us itself just click on this
and next we have to give the artifact ID
as well
artifact ID will basically be
Java
driver
all right
next we have to mention the version of
it
so let's say I am taking the version as
for this as 3.8.1 which is one of the
latest versions
you can even find the latest versions
accordingly on the uh mongodb official
page also you can copy paste that and
you can use that as well so I'm just
using 3.8.1 here so we have successfully
copied our dependencies here
so just save it by pressing Ctrl and S
it will automatically save for you
so it will receive Building 100 it means
successfully we have added all the
dependencies that are necessary for our
mongodb Java driver all right now let us
go to the main section part where we'll
write the actual code first we need to
basically connect the client which
is basically an interface between the
mongodb and Java so for that I'm just
creating a new class here guys so click
on new click on class and just give a
name of uh of your own type I'm just
giving as Java and click on
okay we need to have the main uh right
main section right so for that I'm using
uh I'm clicking on that so that will
have the
public static void main uh automatically
added to that so just click on finish
so as you can see we have created a
class with the name Java and we
have created the main header part as
well so we'll just write the code here
for that we need to create uh basically
where we want to connect the mongodb
client right so I'm just writing the
code
so I'm just creating uh I'm just writing
a comment first we are basically
creating a mongodb client
all right
so the code for that would be mongodb
sorry client
and client again as the keyword we
are using
and we are basically connecting a new
new one right so I'm just writing the
new client as the keyword
and inside that we have to mention the
uh client version so basically we have
the 27017 which is the common or default
port
so inside the brackets mention localhost
and mention the version of it
purchase two seven zero one
seven
close the brackets put
put semicolon and next you have to
basically print out this right so in
Java we use system so if you're familiar
if you're someone who already worked on
Java you might have known this we use
the system dot out dot println as our
output command
print sorry dot dot println
so what basically what I'm telling is
that once it is successfully connected I
want it to uh you know show me created
uh let's say connection
successfully
so this is what I want my uh you know
Java specification to deliver this
output once it is directly connected
with the mongodb client so this is
basically the output I mean the code for
that and we also have to include some
libraries uh for example let's say
import
we have the memory client right so it is
import.com Dot mongodb
dot client
and next we have another one which is
import
com Dot
client
dot
collection
and finally we have
import
com Dot mongodb
dot client since you are also connecting
the database to it we need to mention
the database Library as well which is
client dot DB
database
so these are some of the important which
you need to keep in mind before we get
in the uh we execute this we have to
mention we have to import all the
libraries from our mongodb instance so
this is what we have
so now before we get into the execution
part we also need to open our mongod
instance so for that I'm just going to
see drive again click on program files
go to mongodb folder
uh and then you have server click on 6.0
go to bin and just click double click on
this path and clear this and type CMD
which is command prompt again it will
redirect and this basically type mongodb
wherein we are starting the mongod
instance so it will take time to load it
so just keep it aside
now let's just get back to our jdk
Eclipse where we have successfully uh
you know made an uh connection with the
mongodb client we have imported all the
libraries Cloud click Ctrl shift o
all right now next what you have to do
is just right click on it click on run
as
it says Java application click on that
so as you can see we have successfully
uh you know created a connection
successfully you know it shows that some
reference on 2023 memory diagnostic
login Center info cluster created with
settings which is the localhost 27017
more single and all that so if you are
getting this on your screen that means
you have successfully created a mongodb
connection
all right so let us now create a
database and perform some you know
credit operations like creating a
collection inserting some documents into
that
so now it will take a lot of time to you
know write each and every single Syntax
for creating a database and then
inserting and then performing operations
on that so to save time I've already
created a file I'll just uh leave the
link in the description below you can
check the uh all the syntax and the
commands that are present in the drive
so for now what you have done is we've
just basically created a client
here and next we have to create a
database now in general if it will list
out all the database that are present in
that and if you want another database it
will automatically create a database for
you just have to mention the database
name so what I'm doing is I'm just uh
just reading out this syntax which is
mongodb DB and then we are using the get
database keyword and just creating a
database name let's say mongodb Java and
then I'm printing it out which is
giticket database is successful next in
order to get all the databases in there
we have to use cursor string DB
cursors and we are using an iterator
here that will list out all the
databases that are present in are
mongodb database so I'm just basically
copying all this data
and let us go to our Eclipse paste it
here
so I think now let's just again run it
let's see what is the output
so it says error existing requirement
proceed with launch proceed
so it means it basically shows error
that that's because you know we haven't
created uh you know any collection and
document into our mongodb database
mongodb Java database right so that is
why it says there is an error in this so
we'll just fix it out
so once you execute this you can see
that it is sales it says that open
collect connection and it is connected
to our mongodb database and you can see
we have the list of all the databases
like admin company DB config local
mongodb backup simply code one student
DB test now if you just want to cross
verify it let's just uh go to that so
let me just open command prompt
and click right Mongoose sh which is it
will basically connect to that
so in general what we do is we show uh
we use the show DBS command in order to
retrieve all the databases so you can
see admin company config and all the
other databases that are present
so let's just compare it with our
whether it is not
correct or not so you can see admin
company DB config we have local test
database we have student DB simply code
one and mongodb backup now the thing is
one of the next main problem is that we
just created a mongodb data Java
database but we haven't created any
collection and we haven't inserted any
documents in that so that is the reason
it is not showing mongodb Java database
as of now so for that we basically
create a document and we'll basically
create a collection here so let's just
roll back to our
syntax of how to insert a sample
required by creating collection and a
document
all right now the code is followed as
 collection and within the tag
which we mentioned as document mention
the collection name where we are using
the DB dot get collection command again
and let's say the collection name is
Java programs and then I am mentioning a
new document name which is document Doc
is equals to new document and let's say
our document name is Hello World here so
I'm basically just retrieving all the
values for that I am using this
system.outprintel Ln and I want to uh
the computer the system to mention this
when it successfully gets executed right
so I'm mentioning it as insertion is
completed
so let's just copy paste it and let's
see the output how it goes
so when you execute that you can clearly
see that now in the list of all the
databases we can see mongodb Java also
which we have created just now so let's
just cross verify and go to our
shell and see whether or not it is
showing or not
so again let's show DBS so you can see
we have successfully created mongodb
Java and if you try to use mongodb Java
we have switched to mongodb Java and
when you
write show collections it will basically
show a collection name which is Java
program
now if you want to find the documents
that are present in that you just have
to mention tv.java
program
dot find
okay I just gave a speed
so I have just seen the name we need we
shouldn't give a space to our collection
name so just change the name again as
Java program now if you just write the
collection in order to find the
documents that are present in that which
is Java Dot
Java program dot find you can clearly
see that there is a document which is of
name hello world that means you have
successfully created your document in
mongodb database by integrating with the
Java application
so that is how you use Java uh with the
help of mongodb in order to create files
and store data in your mongodb database
now I can understand uh you know it is
important that you need to have some
sort of knowledge on Java syntax and all
the uh you know syntax all the basic
syntax we are using here so it it will
take a lot it will take some time in
order to get familiar with how to use
mongodb with Java this is just a basic
interpretation of how you can use you
know using the Java application in order
to integrate with mongodb database and
store your information so we'll be
covering uh some more
the next tutorial wherein will cover how
to perform read and write operations how
to update delete and even drop the
collections that you have created so for
now let's just understand
let's just we've focused only on how to
connect the mongodb interface with the
Java and then we have created how to
create a database and then how to create
a simple collection and document and we
have also inserted some a simple
recording as you all know we are living
and working in a data driven world so if
you want to make the most of the data
you need to organize easily accessible
information in other words you need a
database right a database is any
structured information or data specially
organized and stored in a computer for
fast retrieval and searching of a data
well that's great but there are a lot of
database out there in the market so
which is the right one and when to use
the different databases out there now as
you know we have different databases
like MySQL my Microsoft SQL Server
Cassandra mongodb and so many popular
databases out there surely you would
have heard about all these databases
several times firstly let us go through
the agenda for today session this is a
tutorial by understanding what is
mongodb and then we'll go through and
understand and why we use mongodb and
after that we'll be discussing some
features of mongodb up next we'll
discuss how exactly mongodb works and
after that we'll be discussing some
advantages of mongodb over MySQL and
then we'll have a detailed comparison
between these two databases that is
MySQL versus mongodb and finally we'll
understand which is the better database
and when should be using these two
databases
all right so what is mongodb mongodb is
an open source non-relational database
developed by mongodb Inc mongodb stores
data as documents in a binary
representation called base on or binary
Json format related information is
stored together for fast access query
through the mongodb query language now
Fields can vary from document to
document in the mongodb database so
there is no need to declare the
structure of the documents to the system
so documents are self-describing here so
if a new field needs to be added to a
document then the field can be created
without affecting all the other
documents in the collection
now mongodb is a non-relational database
system which is a document document
based database now there are two primary
databases type as we know that is SQL
which is a relational and a nosql which
is non-relational and mongodb is also
based on that now relational databases
stored data in columns and rows so
organizations like Microsoft use
Microsoft SQL Server uh to use the
relational database management system
while on the other hand nosql database
stores schema less unstructured data in
a multiple Collections and nodes
non-relational database don't need fixed
table schema whereas no date no SQL
databases are scaled horizontally and
support limited join queries so that was
about mongodb guys
so let us now understand what is MySQL
as you all know MySQL is a popular open
source relational database management
system
which is developed distributed and
supported by Oracle corporation like any
other relational database system MySQL
stores data in tables and uses
structured query language or SQL for
database access in MySQL you pre-define
your database schema right based on your
requirement and set up rules to govern
the relationship between the fields in
your table so any changes in schema
necessities of migration that can take a
database offline and significant
significantly reduces the application
performance so that was about MySQL so
let us now move ahead and discuss why we
exactly use mongodb
now mongodb uh uses the hierarchical
storage structure instead of a table
like structure as we discussed earlier
rdbms stores the data in the form of a
table which comprises of rows and data
now mongodb uses documents that contain
sub documents in a complex hierarchies
making it expressive and more flexible
now mongodb can map objects from any
programming languages ensuring easy
implementation and maintenance
mongodb is used to handle large amounts
of complex and structured data now
unlike MySQL you only work on structured
data that is it has a proper structure
for example name uh you know a sort of
like that so in that case we use my X
MySQL but whereas uh compared to when it
compared to my mongodb it only handles
uh large amounts of complex unstructured
data
mongodb is open sourceless and has less
server cost and it has no fixed schema
so nosql database or in particular a
mongodb databases are cheaper and easier
to maintain these databases have feature
like easier data distribution they are
simpler data models aggregation file
storage indexing and many more these
benefits require less administrative
cost and consequently are less expensive
all right let us now discuss some of the
features of mongodb mongodb is a general
purpose language mongodb can serve
diverse sets of data and multiple
purposes within a single application
where it uses document oriented type of
database to start data
it has a flexible schema design
the document oriented approach allows
non-defined attributes to be modified in
a single go or
on the slide this is a key contrast
between the mongodb and other other
relational databases like MySQL
scalability and load balancing now
mongodb is built to scale both
vertically and horizontally using the
technique of sharding an architect can
achieve both write and read operation
scalability in this data balancing
occurs automatically and transparently
to the user by the sharp balancer now
we'll be discussing about all this uh in
our upcoming video wherein we'll discuss
what exactly is mongodb and in a
detailed manner so in that time we'll be
discussing about this so for now let's
just keep it uh simple and we'll
understand how it is
aggregation framework now mongodb offers
an extract transform and load which is
an ETL operation of framework which
eliminates the need for complex data
pipelining
and finally just like any other
databases it has high performance as
well as speed so those were some of the
important features of mongodb
all right let us now understand uh how
mongodb exactly Works guys now the
entire database of a mongodb consists of
collections these collections hold
multiple documents and since mongodb is
a schema list the documents in one
collection need not be similar so it can
be of different types now all data is
stored as based on documents with the
help of a key value pair now at the back
end mongodb converts Json data into a
binary format known as bson mongodb also
makes provision for nested data this
makes fetching data comparatively
efficient
now if I want to tell you guys how
exactly mongodb works and how is it
different from MySQL now instead of
tables a mongodb database stores its
data in collections so basically we have
a database in both these uh MySQL and
mongodb but instead of the tables in SQL
or MySQL we have the collections now a
collection holds one or more based on
documents now documents are analogous to
records are rows in a relational
database table now each document has one
or more fields and fields are similar to
The Columns in a relational database
so this is basically
so this is an example of how a document
looked like uh in a mongodb database
guys so we have a various Fields here
such as ID first name last name address
Street uh CD State and zip and hobbies
so instead of storing them in a row and
column we are just storing it as a
document file here so that is what uh
mongodb is and how exactly exactly works
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss some of the advantages of
mongodb over my
one of the biggest advantages of using
mongodb is it has flexible document
schema now schema design for a database
is critical and choosing the right
schema for your application impacts the
performance and affects its ability to
adapt over changing business
requirements so mongodb is a great
choice for modern applications as it
offers a flexible schema design that
allows you to meet the ever-changing
condition characteristics of complex and
Big Data applications so unlike MySQL
where you need to define a schema while
creating a new table that is the whole
structure of the table as in which uh
the attribute type the price you have to
a lot the primary key and so on so in
mongodb you are not required to do that
you can just directly go with it
now the second Advantage is of course it
is an open source and it it incurs few
server costs
so as discussed earlier mongodb is an
open source and it occurs increase your
server cost so open source is always
free so nosql databases use cheap
servers so the price of data storage and
processing is also significantly lower
as well and it is also easily and highly
scalable uh that means no SQL databases
like mongodb expand horizontally that
means you can scale by adding more
machines like CPU and ramp your resource
pool
and finally it is schema less and user
friendly as well now mongodb has a has
no schema hazards you can place data
into a nosql database without requiring
a predefined schema so you can change
the data model and formats without
disrupting the applications or changing
the data structures as well and it is
also user friendly guys it offers plenty
of useful features uh like cab
collection file storage indexing load
balancing replication server side
JavaScript execution that makes it a
user-friendly database
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss how mongodb and MySQL are
different from each other now when I
talk about MySQL it stores each
individual record or data as a table
cell within a particular row and column
so if you want to uh inculcate a new
data into a particular table it is
always
defined into a table with a particular
schema and structure and it is stored in
the formats of rows and columns whereas
mongodb it stores unrelated data in Json
like documents after converting into a
base on file now MySQL requires a schema
definition for the tables in the
database so as we discussed earlier
before creating a table you need to
specify the structure or the schema that
is the attributes and the values that
has to be present in it whereas mongodb
doesn't require any prior schema
MySQL support structure query language
which is its SQL which is used to access
and manipulate the data in the database
mongodb uses JavaScript or Json or jql
as a query language MySQL supports join
operations that is you can join multi
one or more multiple tables using
various joins operations like inner join
how to join left join and outer join
while in mongodb we does not have the
option of join and finally MySQL
databases can be scaled vertically
whereas mongodb database can be scaled
both vertically as well as horizontally
all right that brings us to the end of
today's session and which also brings us
to the main question that which database
you should be using now all the mongodb
is a great database there are times when
you should unusual use it it's not
universally applicable guys so like any
other tool it has a certain limitations
and drawbacks as well but if you are
working on a database for example
requires multi-road transactions and has
structured data with a clear schema and
if you're performing various
transactions in that case MySQL is a
good choice now if I
mongodb works best with unstructured
data so it's great for complex Big Data
Systems guys so if you are using even
cloud computing mongodb is very ideal
for cloud computing as well cloud-based
storage needs to easily distribute data
across multiple servers right so which
basically suits mongodb nature perfectly
also you can use mongodb if you have a
need to fast
and easy accessible of data so using
mongodb when you are running performance
critical applications so in that case
you can use mongodb which offers High
data availability providing instant and
automatic data recovery
and that brings us to the end of today's
session guys that was all about MySQL
and mongodb and
how they are different from each other
so stay tuned to the channel for our
upcoming video wherein will discussed
clearly and in more detail about mongodb
where we'll discuss uh how it exactly
Works where it has initially started and
why is it a good choice for you when
you're working on a complex data
structures mongodb has consistently been
ranked as one of the top five nosql
database Management Systems so if you're
someone who's applying for a position in
database management roles you will
almost certainly be working with mongodb
at some point now whether you are
upgrading your skills or interviewing
for a database management position using
mongodb it's a good idea to be familiar
with the most frequently Asked mongodb
interview questions and answers in the
latter case it is beneficial for you to
prepare for the interview so that you
are not caught off guard even if you are
just interested in learning about
mongodb for the sake of upskilling keep
in mind that acquiring this kind of
knowledge may lead you to looking for a
better job which means you'll be facing
an interview sooner so firstly let's do
discuss the agenda now this mongodb
interview question is intended to give
you a general idea of the types of
interview questions you might face now
we'll be covering some theoretical as
well as practical questions in this
tutorial now typically recruiters begin
with simple questions and gradually
increase the difficulty level so in this
mongodb interview questions tutorial
we'll start with the basics and the
progress to more complex questions now
before we begin with the types of
questions that are being asked here's a
simple and quick tip for everyone who's
watching this video now make sure you
have the never give up attitude I know
it's that time of the year where
placements are going in a rampant way
but and I know you might be giving
interviews uh regularly and what if you
didn't get an offer in one of the
interviews from that so make sure you
have that attitude of never give up and
prepare for your next interview and
whenever you're giving an interview make
sure you are interactive being
interactive is one of the most best or
best way you can say in order to to get
you know hired by the recruiter so make
sure you're conversing properly with the
interviewer while asking the questions
and finally behave professionally which
is another key aspect while giving an
interview so let us now discuss the
first question which is the basic
question which will be asked which is
explain what is mongodb and its features
so this is how you can answer mongodb is
basically an open source cross platform
nosql document oriented database
management system now nosql pin can be
utilized as a substitute for traditional
relational databases like SQL and MySQL
which is dependent on the SQL language
right so if you want to work with large
data sets of distributed data then nosql
databases may be quite supportive which
are used to store large volumes of data
in the form of documents which will
offer the developers the flexibility to
work with the evolving data models as
there is no fixed schema in this now
relational databases such as MySQL and
Oracle store data in tables and rows
right they are based on a branch of a
theory known as relational databases now
these relational databases are
structured and tables can be linked with
each other via a foreign key which is a
property of relational database which is
asset property which is being Satisfied
by the relational database but whereas
the mongodb being a documented oriented
database it can handle only that sort of
information and store as well as
retrieve information from these
documents only it provides the
flexibility as well as scalability that
you want with the querying and indexing
according to your requirement this
mongodb basically is based on json-like
documents where we store all the
information in that so this is how you
can answer the question which is what is
mongodb and its features
well the next question is what are some
alternative nosql databases to mongodb
now we have various Alternatives from
mongodb such as Cassandra Apache
Cassandra is a free and open source
distributed nosql database management
system which is again similar to that of
mongodb to handle large amounts of
unstructured data across the servers
providing High availability with no
single point of failure Apache Cassandra
is a database which can be a right
choice when you need scalability and
also High availability without
compromising performance next we have
redis redis is actually another uh
popular nosql database which is an open
source which is implemented as a
distributed key value store with
optional durability it can be also used
as a catchy Adam message broker also we
have other types other popular nosql
databases like Amazon Dyno dynamodb
Apache headspace and neo4j now HP second
is an open source non-relational
distributed database guys it is
generally written in JavaScript and it
is also developed as part of the Apache
software foundation so these are some of
the examples and can be used in
alternative to mongodb
all right let us now move to the next
question which is what type of nosql
database is mongodb now in general we
have four different types of categories
when we talk about in which category
mongodb comes under so basically we have
key value column based document database
and graph database now when I talk about
key value these database store data as
an index key and value pairs this
database is stored data in a schema-less
way example of a key value data store
include Cassandra redis dynamodb and Etc
next we have column based now column
based or column store type of database
is the one where these databases are
designed to store data as Columns of
data rather than as rows as data if it
stores in a row type of data it becomes
a traditional which is not a noise
database right so again example of a
column store databases are hbase even
Cassandra comes under the column based
as well next we have the document data
base which is actually the type of nosql
database that we are looking for which
is mongodb now document databases had
designed to store documents with each
document having a unique key and popular
document databases are couch base and
mongodb and finally we also have a graph
type of database where they are based on
graph Theory so these databases have
basically designed for data which needs
to be represented as graphs so the data
that is present in this sort of database
is interconnected with multiple number
of relationship between them in in the
form of graphs and trees and a popular
graph database is neo4j as well as big
data so this is what mongodb is and it
comes under the document database type
of noise scale database the next
question is how does mongodb store data
now data in mongodb is stored in based
on documents or the Json style data
structures documents contain one or more
fields and each field contains a value
of a specific data type so mongodb
stores data records as documents which
are in the form of based on documents
which are gathered together in
collections so these documents as we
said earlier has a sub specific data
types including let's say arrays normal
General data and these documents tend to
share a similar structure which are
organized as collection so you can say a
group of documents are kept in a
collection it may be helpful to think of
documents as in a comparison to the rows
in a relational database so fields are
similar to columns and collections are
similar to tables in mySQL database
which is again a no it's a relational
database so this is how mongodb stores
data the next question is mongodb is a
schema less database if yes how do you
create schema in mongodb now the scheme
of a data base describes the structure
of the data to be stored right in a
relational database the schema defines
its tables its fields in each table and
the relationship between each field and
each table so if you take SQL as an
example which is a schema based database
right so in schema is defined by the
tables and the fields that is the
columns and rows that are present in it
and the relation between them
on the other hand we have mongodb now in
documented oriented databases like
mongodb data is stored in collections of
key value pairs now given that Json is a
schema free data structure and that
mongodb depends on it it would be more
accurate to say that it has a
dynamically typed data so whenever you
create an insert a document to create a
schema it will automatically create one
for you so whenever a document is added
the database will automatically create
the corresponding collection
the next question is how is mongodb
different from SQL and better than MySQL
now mongodb is again a documented
oriented nosql database which is used to
store high volume of data and which
needs to process your huge data in a
quick session now it is a database that
came into picture around the mid 2000s
and it is again considered into the
category of a nosql database whereas
when you take SQL SQL is a programming
language used to communicate with and
manipulate relational databases for
example MySQL now there are quite
differences between both of these
databases basis right being being one as
a relational database the other being
relational and non-relational database
there are quite differences between them
so for example if you take the structure
in SQL data is represented in tables
whereas the data is represented in
documents and this further documents are
stored in collections now schema again
SQL has a predefined schema so whenever
you are creating a table you need to
predefine its schema whereas mongodb
does not have the implications of
specifying any schema before working on
it so it has basically a dynamic schema
next we have this scalability the data
in SQL can be vertically scalable and
when it comes to mongodb both horizontal
and vertical scalable of scaling of data
is possible when I talk about
transactions SQL also supports Atomic
operations and follows asset properties
whereas Bongo DB does not have proper
support for transactions and it follows
cap theorem and finally the type of
operations now some operations that we
perform in relational databases like SQL
for example SQL supports join operation
whereas we don't have the same sort of
join operation and mongodb so in this
way mongodb is different from SQL and in
some ways it is better than MySQL in
terms of processing a lot of
unstructured data and also has certain
features like replication sharding and
mapreduce and some of more critical
features that are not present in MySQL
well the next question is what are the
different data models in mongodb now
data models are categorized into two
types the first one is embedded data
model the next one is referent data
model now if I talk about Emirate data
model embedded documents capture
relationship between data by storing
related data in a single document
structure whereas reference data models
store the relationship between data by
including any links or references from
one document to another
moving on to the next question the next
question is how does indexing Works in
mongodb now a good indexing strategy be
it a relational database or a nosql
database it is essential for ensuring
that your database returns your results
as quickly as possible now mongodb
indexing is a special data structure on
which the index is created to hold the
data of a specific fields in a document
now in the absence of indexing in
mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection which is basically a
collection scan so mongodb indexes make
it unnecessary to perform a collection
scan which involves looking through
every document in collection from
matches to your query it also provides
effective indexing strategy now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or more multiple Fields And
even through throughout a mongodb
database so you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly add let's say
effectively access the data you required
from it and it also provide search
efficiency now indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which will bring
search efficiency in various execution
of statements so this is how indexing
Works in mongodb
so moving on to the next question what
is mongodb replication and sharding now
if I talk about replication replication
means duplicating the same data across
multiple mongodb servers so the main use
of replication is the data is available
at an instant way that is high
availability of data and it also
supports data redundancy and multiple
copies of of the data are being saved
across servers and also it provides data
recovery and backup options as well so
in a nutshell you can say that database
replication is the process of copying
data from one database in one server to
another database in another server
ensuring that the same data is available
on more than one mongodb server so again
the main purpose of using replication is
data redundancy and high availability so
by keeping data several copies or
replica stored on physically separate
servers it will ensure that the data is
protected and it is also accessible
whenever we need and also by generating
multiple copies of your data replication
enables you to increase data
availability which is also another
important factor this is especially
helpful if a server fails so in that
case you can use the replication and
finally you can also recover the data
that is lost due to any uninterrupted or
any hardware failure issues
now if I talk about sharding sharding is
also similar to that of replication but
it is a method of Distributing data
across multiple databases and mongodb
supports this deployment of data with
having large data sets and high
throughput via sharding
so let's take an example so you can give
an example to the recruiter like this
let's say I have a database having two
million users and it has a capacity
which is 2 million records now what I'm
doing is I'm basically Distributing the
data across multiple databases and I'm
storing different data in different
databases now we have two machines which
has one million user capacity and
another 1 million user capacity
so in this way you can add more and more
multiple databases in order to store
your data
so by adding more capacity to a single
server such as adding more memory and
processing units or adding more RAM on a
single server that can be done using
sharding
let us now to move on to the next
question which is explain horizontal and
vertical scaling now vertical scaling
refers to adding more resources like CPU
Ram or any hardware or hard drive disk
space to your server which is again a
database or an application server which
is done on demand on the other hand
horizontal scaling refers or involves
adding more processing units or physical
machines to your server or databases now
mongodb which is a nosql database
handles horizontal scaling through
sharding so in a nutshell you can say
that vertical scaling can be used in
order to increase or decrease the
capacity of existing Services whereas
horizontal scaling adds more resources
like virtual machines to your system to
spread out the workload across them the
next question is when should we embed
one document with another so you should
consider embedded document that is sub
document whenever you rely on these four
factors that is when the relationship is
one to few that is it can be one two one
too many but not one to one so for
unlimited use case you should start
considering separating sub documents
into another collection the next
situation is when retrieval is likely to
happen together which will improve the
performance in such case you can embed
one document with another the next
factor is when updates are likely to
happen at the same time you can use this
multi-document transaction by embedding
data model and finally when the field is
rarely updated in such case you can use
the embedded document
well let us now move on to the next
question which is what are replica sets
and explain primary and secondary
replica sets in mongodb the process of
replication as we discussed earlier is
done via using replica sets in simple
words it is a group of mongod processes
to keep the same data across different
servers now a replica set is basically a
collection of related mongodb nodes
which must have three notes at least now
one of them must be a primary and the
rest secondary ones and a replication
structure can have up to 50 nodes so the
main types of nodes that we have is
primary and the secondary or you can
call it them as primary and secondary
replica sets now when I talk about
primary replica set it is the primer is
the member in the replica set that
receives the write and read operations
but read operations can be pointed out
to secondary nodes changing the
configuration at the moment to perform
the query beside is the replica set can
have only one primary node at most and
talking about secondary the secondary is
the node where the data is replicated to
maintain a copy a replica set can have
one or more secondary nodes and the
clients cannot write data to secondary
ones only they can read from them and if
at all there is any failed node it works
as a secondary node again until it is
until a new primary node will be
replaced with that so this is what a
replica set means and the type of
replica set which is the primary and
secondary I hope you understood this
so moving on to the next question which
is what is the use of capped collections
now the size of collection in mongodb is
typically unrestricted right so the
collection increases its size as more
documents are being added to that now a
capped collection is a special type of
collection that has either a fixed
number of documents in a collection or
fixed number of elements so it creates
new documents by overriding the oldest
documents present in that collection so
collections can have maximum size or
document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond the maximum threshold
that is being allocated and all capped
collections must specify a maximum size
and may also specify a maximum document
count only now mongodb removes older
documents if a collection reaches the
maximum size limit before it reaches the
maximum document count so overall the
structure and functionality of a capped
collection supports high performance for
credit operations like create read and
delete so this is what cap collection
says and some of it characteristics and
why we use it let us now move on to the
next question which is how can you store
images videos and other large files now
we often need to store files in our
databases but mongodb sometimes or it
doesn't let you store any file larger
than 16 MB in a normal document so what
you have to do instead Momo DB has a
functionality specifically for storing
large files and it goes by the name
gridfs yes you have heard it right grid
FS is a driver specification for
uploading and retrieval of mongodb files
which are larger than 16 MP in order to
store images videos and other large
files it is one of the most popular
specifications and it it has a size
limit of more than 16 MB so you can
store images videos that have size more
than of 16 MB now chunks of files like
beaten audio it upbeat of PDF file or
anything it is being streamed as a
chunks so these are streamed into the
database and each chunk is limited 255
KB in this size this means that the last
chunk is normally either equal to or
less than 255 KB so whenever you read
from grade FS the driver resembles all
the chunks as needed this means that you
can read sections of a file as per your
query range
so I hope you understood uh what is grid
fs and what is the process to store
images videos and other large files
which is of more than 16 MB so basically
the interviewer want to know that
whether you are not familiar with the
concept of grid FS so that is the reason
he might ask you this question so you
have to be well prepared for it
well the next question is explain
aggregation in mongodb mongodb
aggregation process the data records
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single competent result just
like any other operations that are
performed in a relational database
similar to that aggregation is also used
in order to act on a group of values
from multiple documents present in a
collection to perform operations for
this grouped values and return a single
competitive results now it actually
groups multiple documents which applies
an aggregation operation and it is
basically returning as the particular
value that we want from that operation
now there are various ways on how you
can perform aggregation we have three
different ways of carrying the
aggregation process in mongodb the first
one is aggregation pipeline next we have
mapreduce and finally we have single
purpose aggregation so you can further
explain each of these aggregation uh
depending upon the interviewer's
preference so basically agree
application process in mongodb is
modeled on the concepts of data
processing pipeline so multiple document
enter the pipeline and then these
documents are being transformed into the
aggregated results next we have the map
reduce as the name suggests it does to
operation which is mapping and then
reducing that operation so it will map
each document and process along with one
or more objects for each document and
reduce phase in which output of map
operations are being combined together
and finally we have single purpose
aggregation operation where these
operations aggregate all the documents
from a single collection in mongodb now
even though they provide a simple access
to the basic aggregation operations they
lack the flexibility that are being
provided by the aggregation Pipeline and
map reduce operation
so these are the three uh aggregation
pipeline method which they go through
first is basically the math stage which
will filter the records or the documents
we need to work with uh and next it
performs the group operation which
basically is the aggregation and finally
it will sort the data so it will sort
the resulting documents the way we
require that is an ascending and
descending order now just like uh any
other operations given by aggregation
and mongodb we also have five different
types of operations that we can perform
which is sum which will add up the
values of every document next we have
average which will compute the average
value of every document and we have Min
which returns a minimum value from a
document and we have Max which will
written the maximum value within a
collection and finally we have Push
which will add the value to an array in
the document moving on to the next
question what is meant by ID field in
mongodb ID is the field that uniquely
identifies a document present in the
mongod EB collection so when you are
trying to insert a new document into the
database mongodb will automatically
create a unique ID field which will have
a unique value to its name now by
default mongodb creates a unique index
for the ID field during the creation of
any collection and the ID field is
always the first field in the document
and if the server receives a document
that does not have any ID field first
then the server will move the field at
the beginning and also ID field can be
avoided in the document that you want to
return by setting the value of the ID
field as 0 in the query
so what are some utilities for backup
and restoring in mongodb now by default
mongodb shell does not include any
import export of data or even
duplication or retrieval of uh data from
other uh you know applications but
however mongodb provides the utilities
and database tools to take backup and
perform the restore operations now
mainly we have four type of backup and
restoring options which are input
 export term and malware
restore so you can use one of these
utilities like Dom import export
and restore to move your data in and out
of your mongodb database now the most
commonly used are mongodum and
restore the mongodon utility creates a
binary backup you know of a mongodb
database the mongodom tool is the
preferred method of dumping data from
your Source mongodb deployment and if
you're trying uh to restore the data
that you have basically deleted or
dumped you can use the Monger register
in order to fetch back the data that you
have dumped
so the next question is can you explain
about mapreduce process in mongodb map
reduce is basically a data processing
Paradigm for condensing large volumes of
data into useful aggregated results so
basically mongodb provides the map
reduce features for only aggregation
purposes and generally there are two
phases of the map reduce as you can see
in the name which is mapping and
reducing so in the first phase each
document is processed and emits common
and redundant part of the document to
pass a unique record for the next phase
and in the next phase all the unique
part gets together and aggregated to
produce a single result and finally we
have a query here we'll pass the query
to filter the resultant set so with the
help of map reduce user can perform
sorting filtering and document
modification as per their need
so moving on to the next question which
is how does mongodb Ensure High
availability of data
in general High availability refers to
the uh you know Improvement of a system
or any applications availability by
minimizing the downtime caused by
routine maintenance or any hardware
related uh you know issues so mongodb
automatically stores copy sets and
multiple copies of data distributed
across servers and data centers now in
general mongodb is one such database
which can provide High availability for
the users by using features like
replication and sharding now in
replication the replica sets help
prevent website downtime using native
duplication and automatic failures now
mongodb has a great support for high
availability without no thought through
replication set but replica set is not
enough for a production ready system
that is it requires a bit of planning in
order to deploy this so sometimes it
might be an issue but in most of the
cases if the system crashes or the
hardware or software faces any issues uh
you know ODB in the data mongodb helps
you recover and backup your data in the
system
so the next question is what is the role
of profiler in mongodb now so far we
have discussed some of the basic to
moderate uh level questions guys now
from here on you will find some
practical as well as you know advanced
level questions so you might need to
focus a little bit and even if you're
not confident and if you don't know the
answer which we are discussing now you
can directly tell to the recruiter of
the interviewer that you do not know the
answer but you hope that you have an
idea on this and you can work on that
and you can get back to him so again
let's get back to the question which is
what is the role of profiler in mongodb
now database profiler is used to collect
information regarding the queries which
are executed on an individual database
instance so basically this uh profiler
in mongodb database allows you to
collect performance data about
operations occurring on a mongodb
instance
the next question is can we use regular
expressions in mongodb now in SQL we do
have regular Expressions where we need
uh where we write a query to find
certain patterns that are present in our
database table right in a similar way
regular expressions are also used to
match patterns in a document just like
finding a pattern in an SQL tables so
regular expression basically provides
patterns a sequence of characters for
matching and defining a search pattern
and also retrieving an unidentified
field using a certain pattern becomes
easily within a document and querying a
database in order to find a smaller
subset of data within a collection we
can use regular expression so regex
operator in mongodb provides regular
expression capabilities from pattern
matching strings in the queries and the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name dot find mention the field name and
mention the reex keyword and mention the
pattern now the pattern can be of any uh
of your choice
so the next question is how do you
search for documents in which a specific
field has one or more values now you can
say this is a bit of practical question
guys the interviewer wants to know
whether you are not uh whether or not
you are comfortable and have an idea of
using various operators in mongodb so
you can use the DB dot collection file
operation and also use a query operator
which is dollar in in order to specify
the field and the values that you want
to retrieve or you want to search for
inert document so for example I have
given an example which says that in
order to return all employees whose
title is product manager or executive
director in such case the query would be
DB dot employees dot find mention the
field which is title mention the uh in
which is a query operator here mention
the product manager and executive
director which we are trying to find so
if there is any record or the person who
is associated associated with this title
of product manager or executive director
it will retrieve the record now we have
a person name whose first name is Rahul
and last name is Kumar whose ages 29 and
title is product manager so this is how
you can search for a document with a
specific field which has one or more
values
so the next question is which command
are used to insert single and multiple
documents into a collection now we
basically have two types of commands
which is DB dot collection dot insert1
which will insert a single document into
a mongodb collection and it returns a
document containing the inserted
documents ID field and next we have the
same uh command but the keyword changes
which is insert mini which is insert a
single or even multiple records uh into
a mongodb collection again it returns a
document containing each inserted
document's ID
well the next question is what is the
difference between all and in operator
in mongodb now both all and in operator
are used to filter documents in a sub
array based on a conditional statement
so but there are
some differences or subtle differences
between all and in operator now when I
talk about all operator all operator
retrieves all the documents which
contains a subset of the value we pass
and this subset might be in any order
but whereas in operator retrieves all
the documents which contains the either
of the values we pass
moving on what is the next question is
both rights and rates become faster when
you add more slaves to replica set as
the statement true or false explain the
reason well this statement is false now
a replica set can only have a primary uh
at any particular time that is having a
one master with other nodes the
secondary notes being slaves so all
right operations are performed only on
the master note read operations on the
other hand can be performed on any
instance which can be a slave or a
master node so as a result adding more
slaves to a replica set accelerates only
reads operation and nods the and not the
rights operation so the statement is not
valid and it is a false statement we
cannot uh you know write and read both
uh operation when you add more slave to
replica set
the next question is what is Shard e and
mention the components of mongodb
sharded cluster now what is a short key
chart key is used by mongodb to
distribute the documents of a collection
across charts now on charting a mongodb
data set a short key is automatically
created by default so the short key can
be in the form of indexed field or
indexed compound fields that will be
used to distribute the data among the
shots generally The Shard key is used to
distribute the mongodb's collections
documents across all the shards where
the key consists of a single field or
multiple fields in every document now
the idea is to have multiple replica set
with multiple primaries which would
basically divide data and load it among
themselves and each of these replica set
is called as shut
chat basically has three components
which is basically Shard Mongoose and
config serger all this together
comprises of a mongodb sharded cluster
now when I talk about Shard what is a
Shard Shard contains a subset of the
sharded data okay A Shard is basically a
single mongodb server or a replica set
that stores a partition of the
application data that you have divided
now next we have the mongos Mongoose
router or the it is a router of
operations now because each chart
contains only part of the cluster data
you need something to root operations to
the appropriate charts that's where
mongos comes in the Mongoose process is
a router that directs all the reads
writes and commands to the appropriate
shard in this way mongos provides client
with a single point of contact with the
cluster and finally we have config
servers now Mongo's process are
basically are durable should be durable
that means it must be in a position to
store the metadata in order to properly
manage the cluster right which we have
formed with The Shard key so that's the
job of the config server this metadata
includes the cluster configuration the
location of each database collection and
the particular range of data there so
this is what basically shark Key is and
multiple components that are included in
the mongodb sharded cluster
so moving on to the next question which
is the joint plus is a key feature of
relational database systems what is the
mongodb equivalent if any and are there
any limitations now whenever we hear
about joints we have like different
operations like inner joint out design
left join and uh you know cross join so
similarly we have a question here that
means if we talk about no SQL that means
we do not have no joints that means we
do have joints or we do not have joints
that's the main question but the thing
is we have a join equivalent in mongodb
also which is the lookup operator which
is a significant disadvantages that is
it does not work in charted collection
right so it's worth noting that rather
than looking for a direct equivalent to
join mongodb developers often simply
denormalize the data and which
eliminates the need for a join you know
operation in a mongodb database so in a
nutshell you can say it performs an
outer join to a collection in the same
database to filter the documents from
The Joint collection for processing now
the lookup operator adds a new array
field to each input document and this
new array field contains the matching
documents from The Joint collection
so the next question is mention some
pros and cons of normalizing data in
mongodb database now normalizing data is
a key factor in relation database but
what about mongodb now updated documents
is fast for normalized data and it is
relatively so slower for denormalized
data well on the other hand reading
documents is fast in denormalized data
and slower for normalized data so
denormalized data is hard to keep in
sync and takes up more space so rdbms
generally have this organic support
for normalization and a lot of data to
be managed as a separate entity whereas
nosql dbmss like mongodb do not have
this active support for normalization
so the next question is what are the
advantages of using mongodb now there
are various advantages of using mongodb
for example it is an open source DB that
is it is ready readily available for
everyone to download and perform the
operations right away and it is also
easy to use the syntax is also user
friendly just like SQL it is also highly
flexible which allows you to store and
work on different data types and allows
you to store unstructured data of
different types in one or more documents
and the security is also a Paramount
Feature for any user right so mongodb
provides Advanced security features as
well and we also talked about high
availability in our previous question
and it also has reliable indexing for a
faster retrieval of data it has a
flexible schema design unlike the
predefined schema in relational
databases so this flexible or the
dynamic schema design allows you to meet
the ever-changing conditions of the Big
Data applications uh you know with the
vast amount of data that is being
incorporated into the documents you can
have a better Edge on the data if you're
working on large scale applications then
mongodb can be a great choice for you
with all this it also gives you high
performance which is another key feature
of mongodb and one of its greatest
advantage of a noiseql database
and that gives us the last question of
our interview question uh which is what
are some applications of mongodb now
mongodb being a noise called database is
widely popular in many uh sectors
nowadays and some of the major
applications or real-time use case of
mongodb is it is used in in iot which is
internet of things with the world
rapidly advancing in uh you know in
technology iot plays a crucial role and
it is important that we uh as a user you
know have these uh intention to store
the data and have that data predicted in
any sense now the data is only getting
larger and larger and we also heard this
phrase that data is the new oil so with
the coming in the coming years the data
is exceptionally going to rise and we
need mongodbs to store this uh huge or
huge volumes of data into our uh
databases right so it is one of the
applications of mongodb and we also have
mobile applications and in order to
perform real-time analysis and we also
have uh it is also used in catalog
management content management and for
product management and various others
sectors as well now companies also like
to use nosql databases uh because of its
flexible uh design and the need of you
know storing data without any uh
predefined schema makes it uh best nosql
database like companies like eBay
Shutterfly New York Times Verizon and
many other big companies use uh mongodb
nowadays and also the one of the real
life application of use cases the best
example you can give is aadhar card
which is India's unique identification
which is uh based on uh identifying a
person's you know identity so the other
uses mongodb to store this massive
amounts of demographic and biographic
biometric data of over more than 1.5
billion uh you Indian users so other
users mongodb in order to store the
images QR code details you know the
personal details of the user in its
database so these are some of the
applications of mongodb and with that we
have reached the end of this session on
mongodb full course hope the session was
informative and helpful we hope you had
