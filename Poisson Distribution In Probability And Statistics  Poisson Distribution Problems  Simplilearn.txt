hello everyone
welcome to yet another video by simply

data science has grown in popularity as
an interdisciplinary field
it is tracked facts and insight from
structured semi-structured and
unstructured data sets using scientific
approaches methods algorithms and tools
the probability distribution is an
important when performing data analysis
and preparing a data set for model
training
in today's session we'll discuss one
such probability distribution that is
poisson distribution
so let's see what's in it for you
we'll start this session by discussing
what is poison distribution
then we'll move on to the applications
of poisson distribution
and we'll work on some examples to
understand it
finally
we'll have a question for you so that
you can write your answers in the
comment section
so let's begin
a positive distribution is a probability
distribution used in statistics to show
how many times an event is likely to
happen over a given period of time
to put it another way it's a count
distribution
poisson distribution are frequently used
to comprehend independent event at a
constant rate over a given interval of
time
the positive distribution was developed
by french mathematician simon dennis
poison in 1837
a poison distribution is used in cases
where the chances of any individual
event being a success is very small
the number of defective pencils per box
of a 6000 pencil
the number of plane crashes in india in
one year
or the number of printing mistakes in
each page of a book
all of these examples can have use of
poison distribution
the poison distribution can be used to
calculate how likely it is that
something will happen x number of times
a random variable x has a poisson
distribution with parameter lambda and
the formula for that is e to the power
minus lambda
into lambda to the power x divided by x
factorial
where x can be the number of times the
event is happening
the value of e is taken as 2.7182
let's discuss some application of
poisson distribution
if you want to calculate the number of
deaths per day
or week due to rare disease in a
hospital you can use a poisson
distribution
in a similar manner the count of
bacteria per cc in blood or the number
of computers infected as virus per week
the number of mishandled baggage per
thousand passengers can also have an
application for poison distribution
let's discuss one example to see how you
can calculate the poisson distribution
suppose on an average a cancer kills
five people each year in india
what is the probability that one person
is killed this year
we'll assume all these events are
independent random events
so by the formula
we have x is equal to one because we
have to calculate the probability of one
percent that is killed this year
so p x equal to 1 will be equal to e to
the power minus 5 into 5 to the power 1
divided by 1 factorial which will come
out to be 0.033
which will be near to 3.3 percent
so
the probability that only one person is
killed this year due to cancer is 2.3
percent
now we have one question for you
do try to answer in the comments section
suppose the trains arrive at a railway
station with an average arrival rate of
4 trains per hour what is the
probability exactly 6 strains will
arrive in a 2 hour period
and here are options
please do let us know your answers in
the comment section
so with this we come to an end to this
tutorial i hope this video was
informative for you if yes
