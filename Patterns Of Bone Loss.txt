hi my dear conquerors this is dr.
Kalyani from team MDS conquer today we
will talk about bone loss patterns and
trauma from occlusion so come into that
bone destruction is caused by extension
of the gingival inflammation if in case
of a gingivitis you have more of coke
oil and straight roads in periodontitis
you have more of spirochetes similarly
the fibroblast and lymphocytes are
replaced by plasma cells so
histopathological changes seen are the
gingival inflammation extends into the
collagen fiber bundles so it follows the
course of blood vessels through the
loosely arranged tissue around them into
the alveolar bone so our concern is how
is it reaching that of a alveolar bone
so it is concentrated in the marginal
periodontium the reaction is then
further much diffuse one so after you
see once how it is coming to the bone it
is more through the blood vessels and
through its fibers so once they are
transmitted you can see that here they
have the blood supply these are the
blood vessels it supplies to that over
to the bone and you can see that already
the inflammation has reached it the bone
so once it reaches the bone it spreads
into the marrow spaces and replaces the
marrow so the entire healthy marrow is
replaced by leukocyte they can fluid
exudate so then there is a change in the
cells that multinuclear osteo class and
mononuclear phagocyte
increase in number and the a-pillar
lining with how ships plaque your name
and the marrow spaces resorption
proceeds within and it further thin that
of a table alkali so these are the
changes which you can observe in case of
a bone once the that infection reaches
the bone radius of action is a concept
given by grant and show in 1979 which
means that you are bacteria and it's
whatever toxin is there it has to be
there in a proximity with that of the
bone so it has to be very close by or
next to the bone in the
diameter is around 1.5 to 2.5 so for
example if the bacteria is here it can
only affect 1.5 to 2.5 around it
anywhere he'll other areas would be
healthy so they again have to move here
to attack so that is why the range of
effectiveness is 1.5 to 2.5 millimeters
so when the combined with inflammation
trauma from occlusion and kravitz the
bony destruction caused by inflammation
and results in busy born patterns so
assign this corn as a Glickman has come
down to explain this particular
procedure of Association now how is it
the pathway of the spread of plaque
associated gingiva Legion can change the
forces of an abnormal magnitude are
acting so already they're going in one
phase so when there is a further
application maybe they can start
proliferating and infecting more the
characteristic the or the character of
progressive tissue destruction of the
periodontium at a traumatized tooth will
be different from that of a non-profit
eyes tooth through the studies they have
done they have concluded it this way now
he has said that we have two zones zone
of irritation and his own of core
destruction this is a zone of irritation
with the bacteria sits and it starts
irritating and this is a zone of
destruction where you can see you have
lot of destruction done in areas of
connective tissue and of your lung bone
coming to zone of irritation it is as we
have seen it is in case of marginal and
inter-gender in interdental gingiva and
the zone tissue the soft tissues of this
zone are bothered by hard tissue only on
one side right
so therefore the gingival inflammation
is the result of irritation from the
micro deposits microbial deposits and
not from the trauma from occlusion
that's how glickman concept doesn't
support they say the trauma from
occlusion is doesn't aggravate the
destruction bony destruction coming to
the zone of core destruction what
happens in this zone this includes PDL
root cementum and
viola boom it is corona Leda marketed by
trans septal ant into alveolar collagen
fiber bundles and is a seat of lesion
caused by trauma from occlusion he that
is what proposed by Glickman
now one more scientist by name werehog
has said that the distance between the
subjuntivo plaque and the periphery of
associative inflammatory cell infiltrate
in gingiva and the surface of the
adjacent alveolar bone is measured and
he told that the angular bone defects
and infra bony pockets occur equally
often at periodontal sites of the teeth
which are not affected by TFO and the
loss of connective tissue attachment and
the resorption of the bone around the
teeth are exclusively the result of
inflammatory lesion associated with the
sub gingival plot so basically his focus
of Vera was more on how the angular bony
defects and infra bony pockets are being
formed so there are various factors to
determine how the bone morphology is
present one is the thickness with and
crystal angulation of intervention septa
number two is the thickness of facial
and lingual areola plates then it is
fenestration then there he senses the
alignment of teeth is important route
and road trunk anatomy is important root
position proximity with another tooth
surface for all these are the factors
are determined the bone morphology so
remember the seven may be a bit can be
asked which of the following is a factor
that determines the bone nephrology
coming to the bone deformities or
osseous defects so based on all these
situations you have the defects like
this dehiscence means the entire part is
there he sins have a the his since
penetration means having small holes
that's how it is
fenestrated then you have an angular
defect whereas here you can see there is
a quite a horizontal defect now there's
a Cohen who has classified base
on the number of walls present because
number of walls is certain once you open
a flock
sorry events you open a flap you can see
that you you have these many number of
walls very confidently so you don't get
confused when they ask you based on
number of walls present or well based on
the number of walls absence it is
definitely based on number of walls
present only because it is certainty
then three osseous walls that is three
when the three walls are present
let it be buccal mesial distal or
lingual mesial distal that is a three
wall defect or a two wall defect if only
buccal and lingual are there then it's a
crater again you can say like all
craters are two wall defect but not all
two world effects are craters then
buckle and proximal walls lingual and
proximal walls one wall defects if the
proximal walls are present they are Hemi
septal defects if buccal and lingual
wall is or alone can also be present now
that's what I will keep telling you that
if it is all if that's why all the Hemi
septic are one wall but not all the
vanwall are hemi septal they can be
presence of only buccal they can be
presence of only lingual wall now coming
to the combination that is up if you see
upper up from up you can see that there
is only say around only one ball one
wall is missing when you come down you
can see that okay one two three walls
are present so three wall plus two wall
three wall plus two wall plus one so
sometimes it can be from above its own
you can only one wall
once you come below then it is two at
the apex you have three it is like that
so for example if this is a wall like
this from above if you see you cannot
see this part then you cannot see this
part so for example from above if you
are seeing if the structure is present
from here then you can see that okay
this means only you have only one wall
but once you go down you can see that it
has two walls okay that's how it is it's
called a combined wall defect now coming
to the horizontal component first of all
measured through neighbors Pro it is a
horizontal component so if it is less
than 3 mm of horizontal attachment loss
it is class 1 it is class 2 where it is
more than 3 mm of horizontal attachment
loss and it is class 3 when it is a
through-and-through for kitchen coming
to vertical bone losses again you have
angular defect like 3 wall to wall one
wall and moving on to 3 wall defect in
depth so here if you see you have it's
called as I it originally it's an intra
bony defect so here you can see mostly
that in case of mesial aspects of second
and third maxillary and mandibular
molars this is about the two wall most
commonly craters for example this is a
buccal wall this is a lingual wall and
this is from a cross section you are
seeing the tooth like this this
particular defect is called it is having
two walls and this is called crater
coming to OneWorld effects where only a
single wall is present the horizontal
defects if you see a horizontal defect
you have an equal bone loss overall like
this okay this is a horizontal defect
mostly associated with that of a Supra
bony pockets so these are the osseous
craters as I have showed you this is
exhaust taursus it's a normal
physiological variant fenestration sent
by his senses so when you see that in
case of fenestration the marginal bone
is intact it is just like as a hole in
the center like this coming to the
buttress in bone formation if it is
within the jaw in the center it is
central buttressing bone formation if it
is towards the periphery
it is peripheral buttressing and also
called as slipping reverse architecture
means just remember either reverse or
one positive if it is how to remember
reversed means generally this bow will
go and this bone stays so we
have like this but this is Ulta that if
you see you have the peripheries lost
and the center is completely filled with
the bone so this this kind of an
architecture is called reverse our key
picture coming to her ledges ledges are
plucked you like bony margins caused by
resorption of thick and bony plates so I
told you for kitchen involvement I know
that is which I have discussed earlier
was a horizontal component if you see
this is Glickman's classification having
class 1 class 2
sorry grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 and gray
for so that was a hamper door
classification classification bass class
1 class 2 and trusted is one more kind
of a classification and what we commonly
follow is Glickman's classification
Englishman's classification grade one is
early stage Supra bony pocket in grade
two it's a cul-de-sac what is called as
a cul-de-sac means a sac which is open
at one end and closed at the other that
means you have a formation like if you
forgive probe you can only pass from one
side the other side you have a closed
feature so it's called cul-de-sac now
number three is bone is not attached to
the domore fault kitchen that means it
is just covered by soft teacher but
otherwise it is like great for only so
only great for is you can actually see
this lesion like this to your lips
that's great for fermentation so that's
all for this video thanks for your
patience sorry
