so without any further Ado let's get
started so let's start with beginner
level projects so number one we have
fake new detection using machine
learning so in today's world fake news
is a major concern causing
misinformation to spread rapidly across
social media and news platform detecting
fake news is crucial to maintaining the
Integrity of the information we consume
so this projects aim to build a machine
learning model that can identify fake
news articles by analyzing their textual
content by learning from existing data
sets of real and fake news the model we
a to classify articles into these two
categories thus existing media outlets
and social media platform in reducing
the spread of misinformation this
project is perfect introduction to
natural language processing NLP as it
involves TX data manipulation feature
extraction and supervised learning it
can also be adapted for real-time use on
website or social media platforms to
flex suspicious article and provide more
reliable information to users so now
let's see how to build this in this
first step is data collection use data
set like l or fake News Net that can
contain label real and fake news
articles you can find data set from the
kle the second step is pre-processing
clean the text by removing stop words
punctuation and special character
tokenize and stem words used in anal or
spacy the third step is feature
extraction use tfidf or bag of words to
convert the text into numerical data for
machine learning models the fourth step
is model training train a classifier
like logistic regression Nave base or
random Forest on the DAT the fifth step
is evaluation evaluate the model using
accuracy precision record and F1 score
matrics to determine how well it
classify fake and real news tools you
can use is nltk psychic learn and pandas
