hello everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
learn how to implement a stack using an
array in c programming
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you are a tech geek and
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our session for
today
so let's have a brief look on the agenda
we will begin with what exactly is a
stack then we will understand operations
on stack then
we will see how to implement a stack
using array and finally we will
implement a stack using array
practically i hope i made myself clear
with the agenda
now let's get started with our first
topic that is what is a stack
so a stack is a linear data structure
that follows fifo or first in first out
principle all the operations on the
stack are done only from one end that is
the top
so you can see this image here and this
particular image of box can be
considered as stack and you can see that
the addition or elimination of elements
that are spokes in this particular case
is happening only through the top
section
now we will understand what are the
basic operations that can be performed
on a stack so the basic operations that
can be performed on a stack are
push
pop and peak
so this particular image on the right
side will help you understand what
exactly is push pop and peak as we
discussed the elements will be added
into the stack from the top so when you
add an element from the outside into the
stack it will be pushed from the top
that is the push operation and if you
want to eliminate an element from the
stack it will be eliminated from the top
that is the pop operation
apart from these two that is push and
pop we have another operation that is
called as peak the main intention of p
is just to see the element which is on
the topmost part of the stack it will
just retrieve the element from the top
it will not pop it or it will not push
any other element onto the top it will
just copy and it will just print what is
present on the top so these are the main
operations that is push pop and peak
now let us see how to implement this
stack using array
so implementation of stack data
structure can be done in two ways that
is array and linked list
now in this particular session we will
learn how to implement stack using array
data structure
now without further ado let's get
started with the implementation of stack
so we will be performing push operation
that is inserting a new element into the
stack
now followed by that we will be
performing the pop operation onto the
stack
that is eliminating or deleting an
element from the top position of the
stack
and followed by that the last operation
that is the peak operation where we will
be just retrieving the topmost element
from the stack without removing that
element from the stack or without adding
any new element to the stack
now that we have a detailed
understanding of what are the basic
operations that can be applied onto the
stack let's get started with the
practical implementation
now you can see that on my screen we
have the basic fundamental operations
onto stack that has the push and pop now
without further ado let's get started
with running this code don't worry about
the code this particular code will be
present in the description box below or
if you need it you can always write down
to us in the comment section below and
we will have it sent to your mail id so
that you can have a better understanding
of the code and try to execute the code
in your local system
now let's run the code and see the
output
as you can see the code got successfully
executed and the topmost element is a
and the topmost element is b after the
element is being popped away and it says
that the element b was popped out and
after that the topmost element was a and
after that the element a was also popped
out and now the top is pointing to -1
which means to say that the stack is
empty
so with that we have come to an end of
this tutorial on stack implementation
using array data structure if you have
any queries regarding the topics covered
in this tutorial or if you need the code
that we have used in this particular
tutorial then please feel free to let us
know in the comment sections below and
we will have your queries solved as
early as possible until next time thank
you stay safe and keep learning
