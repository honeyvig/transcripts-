every year thousands of students from
all over the world choose to study
outside of their home countries for a
range of reasons many of them highlight
career growth better salaries lifestyle
changes as the point of attraction to
fly out for foreign countries and
germany has always been amongst the top
global destinations for students across
the globe
because the german-speaking population
has always been an inseparable part of
the world's greatest inventions in both
arts and sciences
practically every academic area has a
long and exceptional heritage of success
stories here in germany the world's
first automobile music device accordion
was created in germany that means
germany has always been a great
contributor and world's success
furthermore germany has abolished all
tuition course for both national and
international students making education
more accessible
that's why it is the perfect study
abroad location
and we are going to explore the benefits
this place has to offer for
international students through this
video so make sure you stay back until
the end of this video
the first factor we have on our list is
no tuition fees at public universities
in the last decade germany has made
significant efforts to abolish tuition
fees throughout the country this was a
challenging undertaking since germany is
a decentralized federal republic and it
was enormously difficult to reach an
agreement among all 16 federations
however in october 2014 after a ton of
efforts the consensus was rich and
germany is now offering access to
pre-higher education to all students
regardless of whether they belong to the
native country or continent
now let me give you some statistics
there are 400 institutions of higher
education in germany that have around
2.5 million students enrolled at this
point of time
furthermore 95 percent of these students
study at public universities where there
is zero tuition fee but does it imply
you don't have to pay a single penny to
the german universities
well the answer is no there are other
fees that german university charge let's
look into the entire cost structure to
understand that the universities will
charge you approximately 500 to 600
euros per semester for administrative
expenditures typically referred to as
semester contribution these fees cover
contribution charges travel expenses and
student union fees now let's talk about
living expenses the living cost in
germany is around 861 euros per month
it's a ballpark figure
cities like munich could be a little
more expensive and cities like berlin
could be little cheaper but on an
average if you take a number like 850
euros per month then it could be a good
average to work with
if you break this expense you'll find 50
percent of the sum going towards rent so
perhaps you can take up shared student
accommodation to reduce these charges
next higher percentage of the amount
would lead you towards food and
groceries and the remaining amount will
be going for internet charges stationary
etc
this german living cost is much cheaper
in comparison to neighboring uk
countries such as france england or
netherlands or even united states of
america
the next benefit on our list is that you
need to keep a relatively lower amount
in your blocked bank account and let me
explain that to you
when you go to study in germany you need
to apply for national visa this visa has
number of different requirements and one
of the requirement is to place a sum of
money in a blocked bank account
these funds serve as a proof that you
have the financial means to cover at
least one year's living expenses
since there is no tuition fee in germany
this amount is significantly lower
you'll just have to show the amount
summing up one year's living expenses
such as rent internet food etc
you will have to open this block bank
account as soon as you get your
university acceptance letter or you can
also open this account in your home
country before you plan to take off for
germany
keeping inflation in consideration the
mandatory amount required in the block
bank account for studying in germany as
of january 1 2022 is 10 332 euros for an
entire year or 861 euros for a month
candidate would have to keep a little
more than the said amount as the bank
would levy a service charge on the
student opening a block bank account in
germany the money stored in the block
account should ideally cover a student's
accommodation living expenses and even
transportation past charges
the third benefit we have on our list is
excellent infrastructure and facilities
that germany offers
higher education in germany consists of
three different types of institutions
universities universities of applied
sciences technical arts film and music
colleges
and most of those universities date from
the middle ages bearing the significant
tradition of qualitative education and
prominent names in various academic
disciplines
according to the official statistics of
2018 there are 429 recognized
universities in germany out of which 106
are among the list of globally ranked
universities some of them have been
ranked among the world's best
universities consistently
five of highest ranking universities in
germany our technical universities of
munich
dude with max milan university munich
heddelberg university
kashulay institute of technology and
humboldt university berlin
germany as a whole place great value on
education
and this is reflected in the high
quality teaching seen in country
international students can experience
the excellent quality of the education
on offer through english language driven
courses degree courses are constantly
updated to meet the changing business
world students are given the opportunity
to utilize cutting-edge technology and
the latest research to ensure they are
ready to enter the world of work after
graduation
the fourth benefit of studying in
germany is that you are allowed to work
for part-time opportunities as per
german law international students with
student visa are allowed to work for 120
full days or 240 half days during the
year when the semester is on you can
work for 20 hours a week
whereas during vacations you can work
full time you will not require any type
of approval for this you can
automatically work for 20 hours a week
the moment you have a national visa for
a student
the part-time job opportunities revolve
around the store and restaurant shifts
language tutoring field interviewing or
a call center industry however you will
be required to master the german
language to get these interactive jobs
let's look at the remuneration
the minimum wage in germany is 9 euros
per hour but you get up to 15 to 18
euros per hour if you work as a call
center employee or operations assistant
looking at the 20 hours a week you could
earn up to 800 euros a month which would
sufficiently take care of your living
cost
also you could keep in mind that if you
earn more than 450 euros a month you'll
have to pay taxes and social security
contributions
and since you'll be working as a student
these charges will pan out to be quite
minimal
the fifth benefit on our list is better
job prospects
as you might know germany is the fourth
largest economy in the world after the
united states china and japan
also it is the largest economy in the
eastern european continent because of
that there are plenty of jobs available
for international students with
technical expertise
however to get the jobs you are required
to have german language proficiency
b1 of language proficiency is the bare
minimum before you can look out for any
permanent job
let's talk about sectors that produce
maximum job opportunities in germany the
first one is information technology as
you know the world is gravitating
towards completely virtualization since
covet pandemic the requirements for it
experts in germany has increased
exponentially
according to the survey there are around
124 000 open jobs for it professionals
in germany
that's why it is at the top of our list
the next sector that produces more jobs
in germany is engineering
particularly mechanical engineering and
automobile engineering are the
trailblazers that produce a pool of job
opportunities you can also find abundant
jobs related to the electronics robotics
and chemical engineering sectors the
renewable power sector is another
growing industry that aims to develop
sustainable growth in germany and
another sector that has huge potential
is medical science
germany has always been a big
contributor to the global medical sector
hence
it is quite beneficial to explore this
field the local companies that have
professionals for various sectors
are douche bank robert bosch
aliens finances siemens bmw wolfsbacon
autos hugo boss and adidas sportswear
and shoes
the top multinational companies that
operate and hire professionals in
germany are amazon google mckenzie and
company kpmg posh and mercedes-benz
all these companies have a significant
presence in germany and employ a large
number of professionals
however german universities have their
own career centers since these
universities are of global accreditation
and have strong ties with all local and
multinational companies and can help you
set your career on the track of growth
the next benefit of studying in germany
is the opportunity to settle down
typically after you finish your
university studies your student visa
will expire almost immediately even if
the visa was initially granted for
period longer than the period of your
degree after this expiration you will be
eligible to apply for an 18-month work
visa during this period of 18 months
you'll have to search for permanent job
also you'll lose out on student benefits
such as subsidized health insurance and
free travel card
now as soon as you get a permanent job
you'll be eligible for part-time german
residence permit or eu blue card the
difference between these permits is
really as the name suggests the german
residence permit is restricted for the
jobs within germany whereas the eu blue
card allows you to move around between
the countries of eastern europe
however it is said that the german
residence card is prepared for better
long-term prospects within germany so
make sure you contemplate the pros and
cons of these two permits before
selecting one
in the next phase you will be eligible
for permanent german residence or
permanent eu blue card depending on your
preference however you'll have to work
for a tenure of four years in germany to
apply for permanent residency
that's all we have about the benefits of
studying in germany however if you don't
have the required capital support to do
so we recommend you to look out for
