hello everyone and a very warm welcome
to simply learn in this video we will
learn how to create a registration page
using php html some css and xampp
software
then
we will use that data
and store it in a mysql database
so let us begin and start writing a code
first
now to do that
we need to go to my computer c drive
now zam folder this is the folder where
the xampp software is installed
here
locate to htdocs
and let us now create a folder for our
tutorial and
name it tutorial
now we'll open this folder in visual
studio code
and start writing a program
so let us create a first file here and
name it
register
dot
html now this will be the html file that
is the whole structure of how a
registration page will look
now
[Music]
registration
page now this will be the title
of a webpage
i think that's enough
now let us move on to the
body of the page
now i'm going to write
register
in an h1 point
for the heading
and
now we'll create a form
action would be
the name register.php
and method
or tree
post
okay so
the first label that i'm going to create
will be for the username
so in a registration form i'm going to
keep it simple i'm just going to include
three categories that would be username
password and a third one would be email
so
to create a label for
username
so you always have to keep in mind
whatever name you're giving here or in
the database whichever you write first
since the name has to match
so i'm giving username the name username
and that's it for a label
now let us create another label
for
before that
input type for this
will be
text
name as we've already written
will be username
please holder with display
username
and i am going to put this field as
required
which means that the
user cannot leave this field empty
second one would be
label for
password
now i am going to give its input type
as
password
and you will know the reason later
you can also give input type for the
password as text but it will not be
secure then
password
id will be
password
and this is also a required field
now let us move on to
the label
for our last section that will be email
and
give it
input type
email yes and email can be set as an
input type
name
email
placeholder will display
email
and
you guessed it right this is also
a required field
i think
this is it for the registration html
now we move on to
creating our
css page in order for this html
structure to look good
well wait a second i left off of a
pretty important section of the
registration form that is the register
button itself
so
let me just
not form
let me just create
the
registration
for
registration button
it will be of type submit
and value
displayed would be
register
now we'll move on to creating the css
file
and
let us create a new file and name it
style.css
so the code for style.css is already
prepared so instead of writing the
entire code line by line i'm just going
to paste it
and
you can see how it works
so this is the css code that will make
a registration form
look a little better
so i have created different sections
for different sections of the
registration form so this will be the
registration from input button
this is for the color of the
submit button
and
the rest of the form as you can see
now in order for the style.css file to
work
we need to link this file
style.css to
register.html now how do we do that
we go on to the register.html
back
and we add
just
one extra line in the head of the
program
so here what we are doing is
we are referencing our style.css page
into this page itself
now that's it
now both of these pages that we've just
created are linked to each other and now
at least a registration form
structure is complete
it does not work yet but it will soon
now before creating the register.php
code
let us first create a database
so that we have some understanding of
what is going on around everything so to
create a database what we need to do is
open sample
start the apache and mysql server
now go to your browser
and open the localhost
phpmyadmin
now create a new database
let us name it
form
click on create
now let us name our table as users
number of columns would be
four
the first column will be id
which will be auto incremented
second will be username
make sure to use the same name that
we've used in the code so that
the code does not malfunction
it will be of type
variable character
password will also be a variable
character
email
and now
so as you can see this is the structure
of our
table
of database
form now let us move on to finally
writing the
rest of the code for our registration
form
so now that we have a database complete
let us move on to our back to our code
and create the register.php file
now the first thing that we need to do
while creating the php code is
we need to
connect our code with our database that
we just created so this is why i stopped
in between and created a database so
that you need you understand better how
this code is functioning
now database host
since
we are using sam to locally host a
server
this will be
localhost
a user will be the root user
since we have not set any password on
the database it will be empty
and finally
the name of our database
what did we name a database
it was form
now i will create
a variable con
to
connect
to connect a database
with a code
so we have created host
user
password
and
finally name
now
we have got to add an error message
which will check
if
the database is connected or not
so
will be
[Music]
connecting to the
database
now let us add some code
to check if any variable is
empty or not
foreign
now if any of the field is left empty
while filling the registration form it
will display the following message empty
field
now
let us add another
code and check
up
so now that we have added validation
into a code
now what we need to do next is
check
whether the username or the details that
have entered that the user has entered
into the registration form already
exists or not
and if it does
display an error message and if
the details are new enter the details
into a database
now to do that
let us write another if statement
now here i am writing
an sql command which will
select
id
password from users that is the name of
a table
where username and
here we are going to check if the
username entered still exists or not
look
you
now if the number of rows is greater
than 0 which means username already
exists so we need to display
an error message that would be username
already
exists
try
again
and if it does not
now in this else part we will be writing
the code
for to send our data into the database
now here
instead of selecting we are going to
insert the data into
users which is a table
and
the fields will be username
password
email
and that's it
um
now the password variable
is going to fetch
the details
of the password field
and email
add another statement
to
execute
and display
another message now since we have
entered it into the database we need to
display
a following message too
this would do
now
this will display
an error message in case something goes
wrong
and now
since we have completed this part of the
code
let us end a statement
close the connection with the database
here and end our php script
so now that our code is complete now let
us run
the code and check if it works fine
so
our apache server is running
let's go back to a browser
open the localhost name of the folder
so as you can see register pages are
visible here
register.html
and create
a user
you have successfully registered and you
can now login
so
let us now check
if it's visible in our database
so our database is forms
users
and as you can see the
file that we just created tony
is visible here in a database
along with the email and
one thing that you may notice is that
the password is not visible here since
we use the hash protection for passwords
so passwords will not even be visible to
the
database admins
so this is how you create a registration
form with the help of html php exam and
mysql database
