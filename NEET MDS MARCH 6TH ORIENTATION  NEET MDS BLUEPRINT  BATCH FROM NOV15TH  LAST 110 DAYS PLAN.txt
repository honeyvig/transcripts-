yeah hi winners this is dr srikant from
team mds conquer uh now i'm here to
discuss
few important aspects related to the
upcoming neet exam which is going to be
on
march 1st week okay this march first
week is a tentative date okay we'll try
to focus and we'll try to prepare a
strategy so in this particular video my
main concerns are
okay so we'll talk about what to be done
in this uh leftover 110 to 150 odd days
and what is the blueprint of need how
the questions are coming where to focus
what is scoring okay there are many many
aspects that you have to know before you
start your preparation so all such
aspects
along with the scheduling along with the
time distribution time management how to
be smart how mds conquer is going to be
effective in your preparation part
everything will be discussed in this
particular video
okay shall we start okay right the first
and foremost important thing i want to
focus on almost all the seats throughout
the country that is your all gdc's
all private college seats
and the selection of army corps there is
a particular crowd of people
who prepare need exclusively to clear
army cops so army cops regularly have
two levels one is level one where the
selection is done basing upon your
neet rank and score
and the level two will be an interview
okay so even for army corps level one
selection your neet score and need rank
are important okay accept aims pgi and
jupiter all government colleges
throughout the country will be filled by
neet examination okay so all these gdc's
including private colleges including
your team colleges and everything in
india where around like 5 500 to 6 000
odd mds seats are there which are going
to be filled by this exam alone and the
exam is tentatively now in the first
week of march so from now if you start
your race you roughly have 110 plus odd
days for the preparation
and coming to the neat
scorings okay so need has
240 mcqs covering all the subjects in
most integrated way means
the word integrated is basically added
to any preparation nowadays because you
see any exam whether it's a
like nvd national boards or whether it's
in a licensed exam of any country like
australia or new zealand or if you take
all the uae license exams canada license
exam anything like now all the exams in
the last three to four years are
becoming integrated integrated in the
sense
they are going to integrate the question
of one subject to other subject that's
the word integration means means
for example if they are giving a
clinical based question on trisomy and
neurology
they may start from
the anatomy part
anatomy part where we learn the
trigeminal nerve
so when they start from anatomy part
they jump into the next few lines they
jump into the physiology of how the
trigeminal nerve is going to work and
followed by they add some clinical
features which are of general medicine
and they finally ask the drug of choice
which may be related to the pharmacology
so means a question starts from one
subject and on a series it's going to
jump into other subjects and end at
another subject this is called as
integrated question now most of the
preparations are becoming integrated you
cannot
read a single subject and you cannot
answer most of the questions in the
examination all because now the exams or
the questions in the exams are being
integrated to the clinical scenario
means a basic question is also trying to
be integrated with the clinical scenario
so uh it covers all the subjects
integratedly
and the time duration is 3 hours that is
180 minutes means you have to solve
question fast
and accuracy accuracy and faster very
very important because you need to solve
240 questions in 180 minutes means each
question has to be solved in and around
40 seconds okay so you should be very
very fast so that is the reason why i
always stress the students to have
a good practice whenever you have a
practice whenever you read fast things
on the screen there is a high level of
chance that you can finish the exam
within the limited time
okay the next important aspect that you
need to focus on is a negative marking
concept so previously
a few years back we don't have this
negative marking of concept but now both
the exams ini ct as well as neet has a
negative margin concept that is meat has
minus one fourth negative margin simple
scoring of need is every right answer is
going to add your score by 4 and every
wrong answer is going to remove your
score by 1. so this is a scoring of need
so 240 into 4 is the maximum scoring of
the neat examination so for every wrong
answer you'll get minus 1 for minus 1
for the sense like minus 1 square
okay so each question you need to solve
in 40 to 45 seconds and diagram based
questions are very very key in your neet
examination because if you see the
recent neet exam you have more than 40
diagram based questions so you have
diagram based questions which are going
to be scoring which are going to be
interactive and of course
mds conquer uh the web stuff has more
than 1200 plus videos which are going to
cover all the diagram based aspects
which are key for your exam
and nowadays you have more lengthy
clinical based questions that's what i'm
talking about integrated question like
where i have started the trigeminal now
jump into physiology then jump into
general medicine then finally jumping
into pharmacology so this question is
going to be a clinical integrated
lengthy question so lengthy questions
are going to eat over your time so
lengthy questions uh you need to deal in
the most smartest way that we are going
to discuss as we
start our regular preparation so this is
a rough uh ideology about your need exam
240 questions 180 minutes minus one
fourth negative 30 to 35 to 40 plus
diagram based questions
so i have a rough blueprint here which
is very very important many of us are
unaware of the blueprint this blueprint
is officially given by
national boards okay so nba people has
officially given the blueprint but i
said like questions are being integrated
once you're done with the exam you
cannot differentiate a question
whether it is really belongs to a
particular subject or not but anyway we
need to have a glance over the blueprint
so the first important subject in the
blueprint is general anatomy including
embryology and histology like i see most
of the students ignoring embryo and
histo embryo and store are also
important you will have two questions
from embryology and two questions from
the scholarship okay so if you see the
recent question published in the last
two years you have many questions on the
histological like whatever you do
as a like as a specimen as a spotters in
your
first year
anatomy practical i hope you remember
you have a same pattern of questioning
in the examination hall which has to be
done thoroughly and we have a decent
number of videos on all these spotters
which are integratedly prepared
so then jumping into physio physio is
going to carry seven uh biochemistry is
going to carry seven integrated it's
going to be 14.
uh your dental anatomy is going to be
seven with embryology and oral histology
is going to be seven fourteen
uh general path is going to be seven
micro is going to be 7 total 14
and pharmacology which is splitted into
two parts that is dental pharmacology
and general pharmacology dental
pharmacology basically includes your la
ga antibiotics nsaids
all the emergency drugs in the dental
office will be a part of your dental
pharmacology and general pharmacology
all the drugs that are used in the cvs
respiratory system ans
cns
uh all these systems other system the
renal system respiratory system all this
comes under general form of culture
including general pharmacology and
exclusive topic and
a material aspect like all the materials
it can be an ortho related material
prosthetic related material operator
related material so all the materials
dental metals is going to carry 14
general medicine is going to carry 14
general surgery 14 oral path including
oral microbiology is going to carry 14
and followed by oral medicine radiology
is going to carry 14 speedo plus prevent
to dentistry because regularly we read
prevented dentistry with the pedo as
well as the preventive dentistry we will
read with public health also like
regularly our pattern of preparation so
do make a note preventive dentistry has
a greater weight as your all your caries
activities pit and future sealants
prevent to resin restorative material
your remineralizing agents your salivary
parameters uh your fluoride contents and
all these are like brushing techniques
and everything that comes under
preventive industry
so ortho is going to carry 14 period is
going to carry 14 prostho in combination
with crown and bridge of course implants
is also a part of prosthetics it's going
to carry 14 endo and con's going to
carry 14 oral surgery 14 public health
industry with research methodology you
see more questions on
research methodology which are not
covered in your mcq books like i don't
want to discuss everything in detail
because i want to finish the things fast
but this is a rough blueprint that is
given by national world people okay
there are few topics like kobit 19 is
being added nowadays you'll have so many
questions on kovite 19 you have
questions on the recent advances
you have questions on implantology
so there are many many new aspects like
forensic is again a part of your oral
pathology okay there are many other few
faded uh list of subjects or topics
which are in the list
which are in the list ignored in the
list but they'll be coming in the
examination which i will going to
discuss in further uh uh further time
like in the further sessions once you
are a part of nds concur right so this
is a rough 240 hours of damage like 240
mcqs and the blueprints roughly it's not
i mean it's not mandatory that they have
to follow this but you need to keep this
in the mind when you start your
preparation
and the next important thing okay so if
you if you are going to be part of mds
conquer it is mandatory that you have to
carry
these specific books to make your
preparation more comfortable one is
power play books fifth volume which we
are going to send you by the postal once
you are a part of mds conquer it will be
delivered the hard copies will be
delivered to the proster and i want you
to carry either dentist seventh seventh
edition or sixth edition anything is
fine uh clinical volumes you have two
clinical volumes or dental pulse
whatever it is you know anything like
13th 14th or 15th anything is fine not
an issue because the latest part of
questions
uh
which are which are going to be
discussed on your respective
groups video classes and live classes we
discuss all the questions which are
given in the last five years each and
every corner of the question will be
discussed no need to worry so any
edition 12 13 14 will be fine if you
want to be a part of mds contractor you
cannot
if you want to be part of mds conquer
any of these 13 14 or 15 any of these
edition is fine because
it's better to carry a hard copy of any
any any of the basic mcq books because
we are not well aware of this
networks and everything like there may
be some days where you may be out of the
network area zone and it's better source
of reading is going to be a book so i
want you to carry one hot copy
of any book apart from pp books pb books
we are going to send apart from that any
one of these book is fine one only one
decide what is fine any both are fine
the main reason of these books is you
need to get exposed to the mcqs that's
what my main concept okay right next one
all the previous papers from 2017 to
2021 they'll be available on the website
and they'll be discussed in the live
sessions no need to worry okay need to
worry that's the reason why
and all latest concept related videos
that's what i'm stressing on the kovit
19 videos implantology related videos
all the latest advances in each subject
for example if you take endo the
regenerative endodontics the modern
files
their shapes rotary file system is a
modern topic regenerative endodontics is
a modern topic for example if you talk
about ortho invisalign is a modern topic
okay you see english learners liners are
modern topic you take pido pido will
have an exclusive uh advanced materials
in the feed of smart materials dental
materials related stuff smart materials
is a modern topic so there are many
other modern topics which the paper
centers love to ask questions such will
be covered on the video you'll have
smart notices i my main motto of smart
notes is smart notes that are available
on the website not to make them too
bulky
wherever the basic books are missing
wherever the pp books are missing
wherever the stuff is missing i have
added the smart notes in the most
refined way okay so i can consider this
mds congress smart notices are the most
refined notices what to be done what not
to be done is easily specified you can
you can check them on the website they
are available on the website and very
important
game changers in the last few days are
going to be your last minute revision
notices and the pp books okay so last
minute revision again most commonly
asked questions most common last numbers
scientist names everything were refined
and they were kept for you something
like a like a buffet for you like what
has to be done in on the on the way like
when you start your buffet and what has
to be done when you're planning to end
your puppet like and you need to end
your buffet with a good soft food or you
need to plan like take a take a very
good sweet or something like so it is
planned and organized and everything
will be in front of you you need to pick
the right one at the right and that's
that's the magic of the preparation and
which will be guided by them
right next one the mock exams uh
i'm planning somewhere to expose you
more than
like 25 25 plus mock examinations 10
plus 15 or more than that okay we don't
have a limit you have unlimited mock
exams a minimum of 20 to 25 has to be
attempted before you're going for the
exam that's going to make you more tough
and more strong and textbook
based reading because most of the videos
of mds conquer are prepared from
standard textbooks like for example if
you take medicine videos they're
straight away prepared from harrison
like for example if you take
physiology guyton and ganon and we stick
on to spurge gupta for
the pharmacology based and endovisitycon
to england gohan so more i mean like
entire content is being extracted from
the
textbooks and will be focused in mcqueen
like reading a textbook is different
reading a textbook
assuming that an mcq is going to come in
the examination is different so most of
the mentors has as clear cuddly
differentiated that what to be focused
when you're reading things from the
standard textbook of course we'll have a
textbook reading in the activity on our
regular groups also
make sure you try to have a proper notes
my suggestion for notes is like as it is
becoming
not late i'm talking it's not about late
but you have 120 odd days right 110 to
20 or this i don't want you to write
heavy notes okay you have a video
content uh the video content can be you
can you can access the video content
anytime
and you can access the video content a
number of times so i don't want you to
write a heavy notes just to write
scribbling notes
whenever you want whenever you have a
doubt you can go back to the video at a
particular time you can drag you can
modify the speed
and you can have a glance that's that's
my suggestion rather than writing heavy
notes write a running notes write a
notes i mean write it write the points
or things which really make sense which
has to be revealed for example memory
based things such things you can you can
you can take a call and you can make
your own so this is all the books that
you need to carry if you're going to be
part of mds conquer and rest all
everything will be provided on the
website
and what like
when we go with the preparation there is
there is few unique things that are
going to
make your preparation extraordinary in a
limited time okay so what those unique
things that
you need to do when you are preparing
for an entrance exam in a limited time
because this 120 days or 110 days is a
very limited time
may you may have a preparation ranging
from
eight hours so six hours is a minimum
time like for example if you're in a
housewife having one or two kids
nowadays you see so many housewives
restarting the preparation because they
have
access to the online instruments okay so
a six to eight hours is a minimum time
and a housewife having two kids is going
to handle and a maximum time of like
13 to 14 hours is the time that is spent
by most of the aspirants so in this
limited 110 days you should be unique in
your approach okay means for example
you have something called as 2080 rule
this is what we we follow when we are
preparing for our final
year theory exams also means once the
finale exams are being announced what we
regularly do is
we take the old question papers and we
sort out important questions so what
those important questions basically is
okay so more than 80 percentage of the
question paper will be coming from the
20 percentage of the syllabus means you
don't need to read enter syllabus you
need to identify this 20 percentage of
the syllabus where 80 percentage of the
questions are going to come from that is
a rule called as 20 80
and in this limited time for example if
you if you if you see a modern cricket
which is a t20 you have a limited overs
time in this limited hours time the
batsman's always will focus on power
clip right because power play is an area
where you can score more runs in a
limited hours and the same strategy
should be followed for this 110 to 120
days you need to identify catchport that
the limited syllabus which is going to
carry maximum marks and mds conquer is
going to give you a sort of checklist
for every subject where you need to
focus to grab that highest score so
every subject will have a checklist and
every subject will have a checklist
video available on the website before
you start a particular subject with the
schedule or by yourself you need to see
the checklist video because the
checklist video is going to give a
creepy cut idea like what is this 20
percentage of
so your approach should be unique okay
so access should be unique so the videos
were prepared in the most comfortable
and in the most easiest way that even if
you take a break of six to seven years
or eight years uh
from the field of dentistry and you're
coming back and preparing they will be
so comfortable and easy to understand
the only thing is you need to keep your
efforts like simple like hard work and
time you have to keep from your side
rest all ingredients which are required
for the preparation will be definitely
added by the team mbas conquer i can
assure you my team
okay that's what i say like hard work in
combination with smart work so i want
you to have your
customized hard work for the preparation
the smart work suggestions will be added
by the team mds conquer to make your
preparation more smooth more beautiful
effective with a good result
and of course i said like time
management is one of the important thing
that is going to change everything in
the preparation and of course i strongly
believe the time is the most important
thing on the earth
because
once a second is lost you cannot
retrieve the second back
i can give a simple example like even
the patient is dead up to a particular
limit of three to five minutes you can
do cpr and you can save the patient
means depth also at a particular level
or a particular time can be reversible
the only thing which cannot be
reversible
is time
so
time management is the most important
thing
in the preparation apart from the
mindset of the student okay so mindset
psychological well-being is one of the
primary thing which is going to affect
your preparation
once you're done with the psychological
well-being the most important aspect in
the preparation is going to be time
definitely it's going to be the time
okay so time i have planned your
schedule in such a way like
my personal analysis is oral path oral
medicine
and physiology general medicine
pharmacology microbiology
if you want you can add your general
pathology also here or here anywhere
general path also is given as a separate
subject but you can add general
pathology also because most of these
contents are integrated so these
contents has to be given one and half
hour
and these contents are has to be given
one and a hour every day for example if
your preparation pattern is
10 hours per day
i'm giving a simple example out of which
three hours you have to do one and half
hour this combination and one and a half
over this combination all these 110 days
because these are important you cannot
allocate a different time for this
because the scheduling time is very very
less so seven hours you can keep for
other subjects every day one and a half
hour this combination wanted about this
combination so my plan is endor has to
be done in six days
operative with a part of dental
materials is going to be six days
every day one hour is going to be oral
path oral medicine and general pathology
10 days for oral surgery general surgery
oral radiology is four days
prosthetics i have given six days if you
want you can add one or two days more
general anatomy histology embryology
five days
every day one and half hour to two hour
physio general medicine pharma
microbiology biochemistry five days
dental anatomy three days dental
astrology three days
okay ortho six days
pedo ortho in combination you can make
it as 11 or 12
period 5 days community 6 days again i
have kept lots of time for revision of
individual subject again revision and
mock exams okay so
the schedule was prepared in such a way
that you will have
a lecture days lecture days means extra
days where you can accommodate subjects
which you are weakened where you can
accommodate uh when you are a bit
disturbed like for example you have a
you have an occasion in your family
which is must you cannot avoid the
occasion so i have kept so many lecture
days in my schedule i mean the schedule
will be updated on the group
respectively once you are a part of mds
concur but this is a rough plan
uh which i have prepared uh basing upon
the content what you have done what you
have to do from the website because
there's no point like the the content is
going to be different for different
people like if you're a part of a
if you're if you're prepare preparation
is from a different area or a different
coaching center it's going to be
different like i have a particular
integrated content
notes which are which are made for you
so i tried my best to link all my
contents within this limited time so you
have an individual schedule of every day
and of course i can tell you that
this is not an exclusive in app based
preparation okay so it's going to be a
website based preparation because your
final exam is going to be on a website
okay it's not going to be an app because
app is going to make
your handling properties more
comfortable okay so exam
on a desktop is it's not going to be as
comfortable as app okay right so it's
not an app based preparation it is a
mentor based preparation so you're going
to interact talk with mentor every day
because we have an exclusive course
called so prolife and the mentor is
going to be in front of you every three
days
every three days the mentor is going to
be in front of you if you have anything
you can discuss with the mentor you can
you can you can block a slot to have a
word directly with the mentor that can
be a main mentor or that can be a
subject matter of your choice if you
want to talk with someone okay you need
to priorly book a slot
just by dropping a request your slot
will be booked and the mentor is going
to call you and he's going to spend a
quality of time in making your
preparation better beautiful and
comfortable because the intimacy of
mentor and the aspirant is very much
required to be successful
so what i can this is a this is a like
uh
happiness chart which is given by the
last year students after the result okay
you can see uh more than 73 percentage
of conquer students are 80 percent is
plus happy okay this is what maximum i
can do because i cannot make everyone
happy at every point okay so you may
have a different expectations but what
my point is you can come
you can check you can see the demo you
can check everything if you feel it is
comfortable it's good for your
preparation then you can be a part of
this okay i don't want you to
join and fix your admission then you
think like
it's not going to work or it's it's
going to work my my point is
if you don't have word conquer okay just
know about conquer we are going to
provide you the demo we are going to
provide you the access we are going to
provide you a free demo of three to five
days and if you love the work of conquer
and if you feel this is going to be
useful for you then you could be then
you can become a part of uh mds
conqueror right
so
so this is all from my side okay so like
once you're done with your uh
march examination after two months okay
so once you're done with march april may
so may third week we are not very sure
about the uh timetable okay may
in the month of may okay so you may have
your ini ct so you can extend your
course that is may 2022. you will have
your ini i'm just going to give a basic
ideology of inicit ionicity main session
includes 26 to 30
pg seeds
[Music]
the time duration is going to be 180
minutes here you have minus one third
negative marking because neat you have
four and minus one here it is minus one
third negative marking and the final
score of your
inict will be given in the form of a
type
so what is the meaning of percentage
percentile is nothing but how much
percentage marks you got when compared
with the topic proper percentile will be
hundred
for example your personal is 93 means
you got 93 percentage of marks off the
topper score
so i ini cd scoring will be given in the
form of a percentiles
and your website also mds conquer
website is also prepared in such a way
that your score will be both in the
person tell as well as in the numerical
number numerical number is to correlate
with the
meat whereas percentile will be
correlating with the inictu so whatever
you want to compare and you want to
correlate you can do that that is
available on the website
and each question is going to carry i
mean like you need to solve each
question in 50 seconds
okay diagram list is going to be like 25
to 30 diagram based regular questions
are going to be 160. new pattern
questions are going to be like 10 to 15
or 15 to 20 new pattern questions are
nothing but like most of you are
familiar uh true or false questions yes
or no questions match the following ar
questions assertion and reason based
questions okay there are many such
questions like which are a new pattern
of questions which are added in the last
few years of ionization but they're not
giving much much of these questions
maximum it would it's going to be 10 or
15 such questions will be there out of
200.
70 percentage of the questions will be
from the clinicals exclusively from endo
prosthetics implants
oral medicine radiology oral path and
general
anatomy
and 25 to 30 questions will be from the
theme users okay exclusively we have a
videos on what to be done for imi cd
okay i'll try to provide you that
in the description if you want you can
go back and watch because i want to
finish the video quick and fast so this
is the basic difference between the neat
and ironic
okay so i mean like the offline center
is also open uh the classes are going to
the new batch the crash course is going
