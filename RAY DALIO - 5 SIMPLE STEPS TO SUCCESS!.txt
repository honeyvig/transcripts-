yeah because I'm saying success is a
five-step process first you have to know
what you're going after your goals then
you encounter your problems number two
you encounter your problems on the way
to your goals then you have to diagnose
those problems and get at the root
causes of those problems and that might
be a weakness that you have or a
weakness that somebody has but you
better get at the root cause and then
once you got the root cause then you can
design something you write down on your
to-do list I got to do this thing that's
number four design and then number five
you got to do it yes you just can't say
okay now I'm gonna do that thing and not
push through the results and if you
could do that over and over that's a
formula for success you only have to do
those five things you got the formula
for success and so but not everybody's
good at all of those steps so it's okay
you don't have to be good at everything
you just have to find the right people
who are good we're not good and then you
go through that
