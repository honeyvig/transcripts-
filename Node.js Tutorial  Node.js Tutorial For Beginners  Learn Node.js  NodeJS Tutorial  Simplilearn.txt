hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel this video is based on
nodejs full course we will begin with
full course video by understanding what
exactly nodejs is next we will go
through the installation process of
nodejs and make the computer ready for
nodejs development next we will have an
in-depth understanding of nodejs
architecture and some of its popular
modules next we will see how to interact
with apis using the Express framework
based on nodejs then we will see how to
use nodejs in web applications and API
Services then we will look into the web
authentication using Json web tokens
then we will look into using node.js
with database systems like MySQL and
mongodb and at the end we will look into
nodejs interview questions and answers
that summarize every important nodejs
concept and serve as a perfect
preparation resource for nodejs
interviews by the end of this video I
can assure you that you will have a
proper understanding of nodejs Concepts
and you will also be able to use this
framework in our web development
applications so let's start with an
exciting video on nodejs before we begin
make sure to subscribe to our YouTube
channel and hit the Bell icon and never
miss an update from Simply learn welcome
to this video by simply learn in today's
session we're going to learn all about
nodejs so without fur further Ado let's
begin and look at what's in store for us
first up we'll understand what exactly
nodejs is then we'll understand the
necessity of nodejs then we'll learn
about some of the parts of nodejs nodejs
Express framework nodejs use cases and
finally we'll look at some of the
industry Trends so what exactly is
node.js now consider a scenario where a
user interacts with a web application
the user only interacts with the front
end of the application but there's a lot
of work that goes behind the scenes now
in a web application there's a front
endend a server and a database the front
end is developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consist of MySQL
or mongodb so node.js is an open- Source
crossplatform JavaScript runtime
environment for running serers side
applications it is used to develop IO
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups nodejs was developed by Ryan D
in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.30 now
that we know what nodejs is let's go
ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up nodejs is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast pass in
code execution note package manager has
around 50,000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of nodejs Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a nodejs based server never waits
for an API to return data nodejs
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open- Source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justifi the
popularity of nodejs platform and why it
is being adopted by a large number of
organizations and businesses today so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of nodejs
nodejs consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
JavaScript libraries which are used in a
nodejs application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a nodejs application node
application has many modules to provide
basic functionality needed for a web
application some of them could be HTTP
util FS URL query string stream and ZB
next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and SCD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now node.js is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of node.js runs in a
single thread to take advantage of
multi-core systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
nodejs processes to handle the load a
cluster can be added to an application
in this way here's a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in nodejs are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some noj Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
nodejs applications experience four
types of Errors we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in nodejs are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
an error that would occur when we divide
a number by zero now this error would
crash the node application and so we
should handle this error here's a small
code for you next up we have streaming a
stream is an abstract interface for
working with streaming data in nodejs
streams are objects that let you read
data or write data continuously there
are four types of streams first one is
the readable these are the types of
streams from which data can be read
writable these are the types of streams
to which data can be written duplex
these are both readable and writable
streams lastly we have transform these
streams can manipulate the data while it
is being read or written moving on to
the next component buffer the JavaScript
language has no mechanism for reading or
manipulating streams of binary data
buffer is a module that allows handling
streams that contain only binary data an
empty buffer of length 10 can be created
by this method next up we have domain
domains provide a way to handle
different IO operations as a single
group domain module intercepts errors
that remain unhandled there are two
types of methods that are used for
intercepting these errors firstly we
have internal binding in this case the
error emitter executes its code inside
the error method next up is the external
binding now here the error emitter is
explicitly added to a domain via its add
method the next component is the DNS the
DNS module enables name resolution for
example it is used to look up the IP
addresses of host names DNS module is
used to connect to a DNS server and
perform name resolution by using the
method DNS do resolve the DNS module is
also used for performing name resolution
without a network communication by using
the method DNS do lookup the next
component is a debugger nodejs includes
an outof process debugging utility
accessible via a V8 inspector and
built-in debugging client this node.js
debugger is not featurea but supports
simple inspection of code it can be used
in the terminal by using the inspect
keyword before the name of the
Javascript file in order to inspect a
file say myscript .js you can use the
following method now that we are
familiar with all the Maj major parts of
node.js let's go ahead and learn about
the node.js Express framework Express is
a flexible node.js web application
framework that provides a wide set of
features to develop both web and mobile
applications you can assume Express as a
layer built on top of the nodejs that
helps manage the server and The Roots
now let's have a quick look at some of
the core features of Express framework
it is used to design single page
multi-page and hybrid web applications
it allows setting up of middleware to
respond to http requests it defines a
routing table that is used to perform
different actions based on the HTTP
method and URL it also allows Dynamic
rendering of HTML Pages based on passing
arguments to templates now moving on
let's take a quick example of a simple
hello world program now this is
developed using Express framework to
gain a better understanding all right
first up we have the we express now this
is used to import Express framework into
our nodejs application now the app.get
method is a call back function with
parameters request and resp response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the HTTP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the nodejs use
cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate nodejs first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies iies
that trusted their services to node.js
the reasons why the company chose to use
nodejs were application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is it's basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around 514 billion US
according to the fortune Global 500 list
in 2019 again the reasons why the
company chose no JS were asynchronous IO
and efficient handling of concurent
requests now asynchronous IO which is a
form of input output processing allows
other processing to continue before the
transmission has finished no JS is able
to efficiently handle concurrent
requests with the use of thread pool and
event cues Uber Uber is an American
multinational ride hailing company
offering services that include
peer-to-peer right sharing right service
healing and food delivery the reasons
why the company chose no JS were
asynchronous IO quick iterations and
active open-source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now nodejs is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
is an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose nodejs
were reduced access times handling of
data intensive tasks and the fact that
the servers are active 24/7 now NASA has
lots and lots of data and using nodejs
has really helped them in reducing the
access times it is also continuously
handling and working with large streams
of data nodejs is highly stable which
helps in keeping the server active 24/7
next up we have PayPal now PayPal is an
American company operating a worldwide
online payment system that supports
online money transfers as opposed to
traditional methods like checks and
money orders the reasons why the company
chose to use node.js were the fact that
node.js has extremely fast Bill times it
allows tasks to be carried out with
fewer lines of code when compared to
other server Technologies like Java and
PHP and no Js being data intensive
efficiently handles a large amount of
data next up is medium medium is a
popular online publishing platform
developed by Evan Williams and launched
in August 2012 the main reasons why the
company chose to use nodejs were a data
driven applications now these
applications are ideal for being
interfaced with nodejs servers B to run
AB tests now AB testing is essentially
an experiment where two or more variants
of a page are shown to users at random
and statistical analysis is used to
determine which variation performs
better lastly no JS server maintenance
is simpler than its counterparts moving
on to the last topic of this session
industry Trends now nodejs developers
are in demand across the globe since
many companies are adopting JavaScript
libraries according to fobes it is one
of the top 10 most in demand jobs
according to not Source the total number
of nodejs downloads increased by 40% in
the last one year the use of nodejs in
production has increased dramatically
since it release in 2010 with early
adopters such as LinkedIn PayPal and
Netflix among others nodejs has seen an
exponential increase in its use in web
development the popularity of nodejs is
also accounted to JavaScript now since
JavaScript is the most popular language
as evident from a survey conducted by
stack Overflow in 2019 many developers
can start working on nodejs library with
not much of a learning curve nodejs
developers are being offered better
salary options than other web technology
developers according to payscale the
average salary of a nodejs developer in
India is around
63,000 rupees per year the average
salary of a nodejs developer across the
United States is around 105,000 us per
year in this video we'll help you
install node.js on your Windows system
so without further Ado let's begin the
first thing you need to do is download
node.js from their official website so
go ahead and type
download
nodejs navigate to their official
website and here you can see the 64-bit
version so go ahead and download that
once the download is done go ahead and
run the downloaded nodejs
installer accept the license agreement
keep the default settings as it
is and then say install
so with that we finish the installation
process once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed to
do so we first open the command prompt
and then type in a few commands to
verify the successful installation we
type in this command node hyphen V now
this command Returns the version and if
it Returns the version it means it has
been successfully installed so here we
go it Returns the latest version now the
final step is to update the node package
manager now this npm is bundled with
nodejs which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes so to do that type
in the command
npm install
npm hyphen hyen Global now that we're
done with the installation of node let's
go ahead and Implement a small program
for that we make use of a text editor in
our case we've installed VSS code so go
ahead and download VSS code once you're
done with the installation this is what
vs code looks like so go ahead and click
on file and create a new file it's going
to be a simple program where you're
going to print a hello world message on
the web browser to do that we make use
of HTTP modules so node comes with
built-in HTTP modules to transfer data
across it so for that we make use of a
required method we create a variable
first say where http equals required and
just say HTTP within single codes now
the HTTP module can create an HTTP
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method so let's go ahead and type
the
code say
HTTP do
create server and internal lead consists
of a function now the parameters to this
function are request and response now
the response is basically used to write
to the client so we say response. write
and here we type in the message say
hello
world
welcome to this
tutorial once you're done with that you
end the
response so the server listens to a port
number to display the message by default
it listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file say demo. JS maybe demo 1. JS
and say save now to run the program you
have to open the command prompt so open
your command
prompt and mention the path to your file
so in our case it's our desk saved on
the desktop so
CD desktop and now to run it say node
demo 1. J s now you navigate to your
browser and say Local Host 880 and here
we go our message is successfully
displayed so let's talk about the
node.js architecture and understand why
it's so good so to begin with node.js
has what's called a single-threaded
event Loop architecture and this allows
you to be able to handle many many
concurrent clients at the same time it's
just a very flexible way of being able
to scale up your support for many
clients and then in addition to that we
have the JavaScript event based model
along with the JavaScript callback
mechanism that allows you to have this
standard approach to being able to
connect with and talk and discuss
interactions between the client and the
server it's good to have these kind of
Standards where you're not using
something that's unique to a specific
framework or a specific technology this
just makes it so it's more accessible
for
everybody so if we look at the actual
nodejs server itself everything centers
around the the concept of the event Loop
and the event Loop has a a an event
queue an operation completed um fire
requests threaded pull and then it
actually do the actual computation or
the file system
interaction all of this interconnects in
a nice seamless Loop the great thing
again with no Js is that it's not new
technology it's been around for almost a
decade it's very very well tried out
many of the largest websites out there
are running
nodejs so let's now dig into each of the
parts of the node.js architecture so
let's talk about
requests so the way that the request
works is that you have your framework uh
such as angular on the client and that
will then send a request to to the web
server there's many ways that those
requests can happen through web workers
through forms and through other
interactions but at some point a request
is sent to the
server and so these requests can be for
data they can be for deleting data they
can be for updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the Q and
threading process that centers around
the event Loop and this is where nodejs
really excels because it's able to use
that single-threaded model to be able to
manage from just even a few requests to
tens of millions of
requests so it receives the actual
request and starts the event Quee and
this is where that single threading
process starts is by queuing everything
up
appropriately and then it then maintains
the threads within a pool so you have
the queueing process as one action and
then you have a threaded pool which
manages those um threads as well and
then we have an event Loop which you
know goes through actually receives and
processes those requests and then
finally what we're doing is we're
actually then going to be interacting
with a system and that could be a
database it could be a cloud system it
could be an API file system but we're
interacting with some something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
nodejs server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment and so let's talk a
little bit about that workflow so
requests come in they go into the event
queue and they get spired through the
event Loop and then we have a
non-blocking operators which are going
to be doing the input output polling uh
such as KQ eole and other services and
from there we're also going to be then
interacting with the threaded pull and
we're using the blocking operations to
manage that threaded pull and then
threaded pull is going to now then go
outside of the server and interact with
something beyond the server so whether
that is a database or file system or API
or micros service these are things that
can be interacted with so let's go
through what mpm is uh so mpm itself
stands for the node package manager no
uh great shakes there as the name says
it's responsible for all the packages
and modules that are bundled within
nodejs so the node packet manager itself
really has two key functionalities now
the first is that reply it is a central
repository for all packages and modules
which you can then search through um
online you can go to search. nodejs.org
and you can find all of the packages and
modules that are out there U the second
is that it's also a command line or
terminal Al line utility that allows you
to install those packages so you can
actually go through and you can see the
version management dependency within
those packages and you can actually
control the packages
themselves so why would you use
npm so npm is really useful for being
able to extend the project you're
working on so when you're building out a
project one of the concepts I like to
use is the concept of Lego bricks um big
fan of Lego and uh what's great about
Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality um but if
you actually get a whole collection of
Lego bricks together you can build like
crazy cool things so think of when
you're working with the node package
manager itself is that each of those
individual pieces that you're working
with um each of those individual
packages are their own Lego bricks and
by themselves you can then edit and
update and maintain that piece um
separately from the whole environment as
long as your inputs and outputs you know
really the piece where you snap the Lego
in or when you connect Lego to something
else um are interacted and open and well
documented then you can actually then
use those modules effectively throughout
your
project um so you can actually then
being able to do that you can do Version
Control on your codes and dependencies
you can do testing very
easily and then once you actually get to
the point where you go yes I want to
release um a new module you can do that
effectively using mpm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for
you so let's go through the mpm
installation so the actual package
manager itself is included with the
installation of node.js so if you've
installed and you're running node.js uh
locally then you've already installed
the package manager uh but you can also
access it through command line or
terminal window um on your your data
server or in your Sur Farm or via the
cloud
uh if you haven't downloaded node.js uh
here's the website where you can go down
to install it and there's Windows and
Mac versions of that uh code as well
with the installers which allow you to
get up and going very
quickly uh you want to be able to run
the installer and accept all the default
settings uh just um you know to begin
with you want to kind of have the
standard setup so that you are most
familiar with the normal settings before
you start getting to the point where
you're a master and you're tweaking
things um there is a way that you can
open up the command window or The
Terminal window and uh once you've
actually installed nodejs um to verify
that uh it's actually installed you can
write the command node-- version and
it'll actually then P out the version of
nodejs that you have uh installed and
then you'll be able to see that you got
actually up and
running and then you can also do the
same thing for mpm you can do mpm D-
Verge and it actually will then show you
which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take a full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now we're actually going to
go ahead and actually run a demo of
using mpm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window uh where I'll be doing
all of my instructions uh then I also
have a folder which shows where I'll be
putting all of the files and then
finally I'll actually have a text editor
in this case I'm using vs code CU it's
free um but you can use any text editor
you like to be able to go in and show
what the uh coder that's been created uh
by mpm in the Json file so you can
actually see what it looks like um and
then we'll modify it a little bit so
first thing we want to do is we want to
go ahead and uh create a uh new project
folder so I'm going to go in I'm just
going to move into do change directory
and go into the project folder and we'll
see down here that we have an empty
project folder um but for this one I'm
actually going to go ahead and I'm going
to create a new directory in this one
and I'm going to call this one uh simply
learn and there we are we've created a
new simply learn
folder and we are going to move into the
simply learn folder
and so we're now in the simply L folder
uh there's nothing in there right now um
so the first thing we want to do is we
want to take H go ahead and initialize
this folder as a project folder for
working with mpm now to do this you will
have to have already installed mpm if
you have no JS mpm comes with it um and
if you want to see whether or not you
have mpm installed so you can just do
mpm das
version and that will actually tell you
what the version of mpm you have
installed is and it also verifies that
mpm is installed so I've gone ahead and
I've been able to validate that I have
mpm installed so what I'm now going to
go ahead and do is I'm going to
initialize this folder so to do that you
just do mpm in it and you'll see that
the parties that were already in the
simply L folder and then when you do
that it's going to ask you some
questions so what is the package name
we're going to go with the defaults for
right now and then I can show you how we
can edit those in a little bit uh we're
going to go with just say yes to all of
these just by hitting
return and you'll see here that we're
going to create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do we want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our um
folder here that we actually have
package.json so we go ahead and open
this up
with vs code here we are we can actually
see what all of the information is we
can go ahead and we can actually go and
update uh this metadata if we want to
I'm going to leave it as is for right
now because I want to show you a couple
of other things so a lot of times when
you're actually working uh with mpm and
the reason why you're using mpm is that
you want to take advantage of packages
that are freely available in the open
source community that are supported by
node.js and one of those is a package
called Express and express is a
lightweight framework for building out
uh web applications similar in concept
uh to angular or
reactjs um I like using it and it's also
a great way to be able to show how we
can uh install this using mpm so to
install this uh you just start with the
command mpm and then you type
install and then we type the name of the
package we hit enter and it goes ahead
and what you'll actually
see is a couple of things one is we have
a dependency in our package bath uh we
also have uh so this is in our Json
package that it's now a dependency
that's written in there uh we can also
go in and under our node modules we
actually see that we have we scroll down
we should see
Express there it is
Express now if we decide that we don't
want to use um Express we can actually
just come in and we can write command
npm
uninstall back in
type Express
Oops I did a typo there so let's try
that again
npm
uninstall
Express and couple things going to
happen one is uh in our Json file the
dependency for the express file has now
been
removed and we can also see that under
our node modules there are no extensions
there so this is kind of cool this
allows us to be able to see um that we
can uh easily add and remove
packages uh so let's just go ahead and
I'm going to install Express again so
install
Express oops mpm install
Express all right so it's gone ahead and
it's installed
Express now what one of the things that
often happen is that when you're working
with a package the actual Json um
package so you'll receive uh this
file and you want to be able to go ahead
and uh install all the um sub modules
that come with it so and you can go
through you can manually install them
like this or you can actually run an
install commands so you can actually
install all of them at once I can just
show you what that looks like because
we're going to actually go ahead and
simulate as if we're going to install
bootstrap which is
another uh popular
framework strap and we're actually going
to go
with and then we'll save
that and what we'll see is under the
packages that bootstrap isn't listed in
there we do have
Express there it is right
there so we now come over to our new
command so we can actually write the
command npm
install and now
sight typo let's try that
again let's do
npm
install okay it does help to save your
file so let's go ahead and let's run npm
install and when you do that what we'll
now actually have is not just Express
but we'll also see that bootstrap has
also been
added now I don't recommend that you use
the uh star symbol which will install
the latest version of bootstrap because
you obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of of what's happened here
now if we want to we can actually go in
here and we can see
unin install
bootstrap and it will actually remove
that from your Json package so there we
are that's how you work with using mpm
from getting started with a uh setup for
a base uh initialization of your uh
package going through to creating the
first package U being able to set up and
control the naming convention for each
of the items within the metadata that
provides the instruction for uh the
package how you can then put in
dependencies such as Express and
bootstrap how you can install them and
remove them and actually use do all of
this through command line if you have
any questions yeah please let us
know so this kind of jump into the
expressjs framework so expressjs is a
really flexible node.js and web
application framework it is just
something you can spin up very quickly
and build both web mobile applications
just a really great tool um you know I
use it all the time for building up my
own
applications um the thing that's so
great about it is it's really simple and
so it's not going to be as have all the
the functionality that you would have in
maybe uh a larger scale HTTP service um
but with that said it does come with a
lot of functionality that allows you to
not only create websites but you can
also do apis and other routing calls
very very nice
so let's go through some of the uh
features that expressjs
have so as I mentioned before it allows
you to build simple web applications and
that can be either a single page
application or a multi-page application
um it also allows you to do middleware
uh requests and responses so for
instance if you want to do an API um and
have that be part of your middleware you
can actually set that up real quickly in
fact in the demo that we'll do later on
we'll actually be building out four
different API I calls that you'll be
able to do and you'll be able to see how
you can use expressjs for that um and
that in then turns allows you to be able
to uh see how expressjs can help manage
some of the routing of the different um
HTTP methods and that you'd be using via
URL and then finally it's just a great
way of being able to uh dynamically test
the work that you are developing so you
can actually build out a solution and
test it right away in Express J is have
it in a single packet and then once you
get to a certain point you can then
check in the whole packet um even have
it as part of your container um and then
check that into your U main uh project
and then if somebody else wants to then
take on the work they can then just pull
that in U so let's kind of go step
through you know a basic example so here
we actually have a full script for
creating a simple hello world and this
includes installing expressjs uh def
finding the ports it's going to run on
as well as a basic piece of code so the
first thing you want to do is actually
go ahead and Define how you want to
install expressjs and this is called the
very first variable which is um
requiring that Express be installed as
part of node packet manager uh mpm will
then pull in the latest version of
Express if you need to define a specific
version of course you can do that um in
this example we're just going to pull
the latest one and then we'll go ahead
and with the second line which will then
install Express and when you do it once
you'll see how quickly it installs onto
your local development machine the next
parameters are actually a callback
function so if something actually
happens when you go to the website where
we're going to run our web application
you want something to pop up and in this
instance we'll say hello o will pop
up the third block is all about where
you would actually go ahead and host
your code and so in this one you'll see
that the uh server is going to listen
and listen to Port 8081 so that's what
that function actually there
defines and then you can either put in
uh the a specific um host address um in
the demo you'll actually see how we
Define that for local host but you can
actually then point this to a production
host environment if you want and then
the final line here is a command that
actually sent a script to your terminal
window telling you that with port and
which host that you are listening to so
let's see what that would look like so
here we see have our terminal window and
we're actually able to then run the
hello world JS script that we just uh
wrote and then once we do that it'll
actually then post that um we have an
example app listening at and and here we
don't have a web domain address but do
have the the port
8081 and in our browser window it says
hello
world so that's a quick breakdown of
expressjs now let's jump over and do a
demo so the first thing we want to do to
get Express up and running on our system
is we have to have nodejs installed so
we're just going to do a Google search
to let you know where you can find
node.js it's actually at nodejs.org so
we select that link that will take us to
nodejs.org and there are two types of
downloads one is the current download
which has um the latest features and
then there's a more stable version that
if you're new to nodejs I'd recommend
you to download next we want to find a
text editor and we're going to go with
Visual Studio code or vs code that's
known um it's an open source solution
from Microsoft that runs across all the
leading platforms so this will default
to our Windows platform but you can run
it on Mac OS and Linux as well I really
like it it's a great code editor it
comes a lot of extensions and it's open
source uh next thing you want to do is
because we're going to be developing
apis we want to wa to be able to
visualize those apis quickly and a great
tool is a product called Postman uh
again open source and so you can go out
and go to postman. comom uh top right
hand corner you'll see a bright orange
download button where you can actually
go ahead and download and install
Postman and that will allow you to be
able to access all of your apis that
we're going to be creating in Express
you can actually use other tools such as
apog as well for visualizing your apis
but this one's just great to get you
started so let's go ahead and open up
VSS code and we want to go ahead and
open a new folder where we're going to
have our project we're going to just for
our demonstration here we're going to
put this on the desktop you wouldn't
normally do this but it will work fine
here and we're going to create a folder
we're going to title the folder node
Express and we'll select that folder
that now becomes the root folder for our
project in visual studio uh we don't
really need the the welcome uh screen
anymore so we're going to get rid of
that and one of the things that is great
about working with VSS code is you can
actually have the terminal window up and
running as well so let's go ahead and
open that so it's running at the bottom
of our screen and this gives us a little
bit of space and the first thing we want
to do is actually turn convert the
folder we in actually into a project
running node.js so we're going to use
npm in it and that'll actually
initialize the project we have another
video that explains how to use npm or
node package manager uh you can go ahead
and find that um in our library here um
but as we go ahead and we do that you'll
actually see that it will create the
default package uh Json file which has
uh the name of the folder is the default
name of the package but you can actually
go in and edit any of these documents we
want to create a default file it's
called
index.js This is where we're going to
write most of our scripts that allow us
to work with no
JS and the first is writing a script
that allows us to install Express and um
we'll use the node packet manager to
actually pull and install Express um you
can for to specific versions of Express
if you want and we're just going to go
with the latest one so we're just going
to put in Express and then we'll go down
into window and SE mpm install D- saave
Express and this will install Express so
we can actually test out the code we're
working on and let take just a moment to
install great thing we're working with
node package manager is that once we
finished with our package here we can
actually wrap it all up and send it over
to any other developer that we're
working with and then you can actually
uh run the the package and actually have
exactly the same code
installed and there we are we have
everything installed and ready to go we
can see we actually have all of the
modules installed you see that we
actually have Express installed as
well and we also want to then make this
an
app and then we'll do app
Listen to Port 3000 so this is by by
default we're going to be running from
our Local Host which is uh HTTP server
running on this test machine and we're
going to have Express for this project
run on Port
3000 and in the once we actually run the
script we'll actually uh post into the
console um window a piece of text saying
server started on Port
3000 so we're going to go ahead and save
this file l crl s to save these
files so let's go into Local Host in our
web browser so Local Host colon sorry
yeah Local Host colon 3000 and you'll
see nothing has been reached that's
because we actually haven't done
anything to initialize the script so we
want to come in and we're going to go
node index.js and hit return and as you
can see now we have a message in our
console window that means that yep there
we go we actually have everything up and
running
um so we can actually see that the
service is running not a very pleasant
message so let's go ahead and change
that so let's change that
to app
get
and
res and so if it uses the Gap message
that's change what we'll print and we'll
type hello
there exclamation
mark and we save
that and we refresh the
screen oh nothing happened again because
we didn't run the script so let's go
back in we'll run the script node
index.js and now what you'll see is if
we refresh there we are we have our new
hello there
message all right well let's actually
start building some a apis in this
environment so to be able to build the
apis we want to be able to pull um
content so we're going to actually uh
create a new file called users. JS and
we're going to
create we're going to go ahead and
create a a user Json packet and a Json
packet is essentially a an array um
consider it like a small database and in
this array we're going to have four
objects each object is going to have uh
three pieces of uh metadata we have an
ID name and email and there'll be uh ID
1 2 and three and then you'll see that
the names will be John Smith and we'll
make up a couple of others um just kind
of giving them arbitrary uh email
addresses this just for our demo here
let me grab this copy it and kind of
speed up the script writing time here we
go and let's just change what we need um
one of the things that's nice with
working with a visual studio code vs
code is there's lots of plugins and so
one of the default features is that if
you select a variable it'll actually
look for the same variable in the script
so you can if you need to you can
actually change them all at once but we
don't need to worry about that right now
we're just creating a Json packet so we
have four items
ID 1 2 3 and four for John Smith and
Jack and
Chris all right so that's our uh array
string and we're going to then make sure
that we can export that as users so we
can actually now whenever we select the
term users in our scripts it'll actually
pull in this
packet all right looking
good now let's go over to our main
index.js file and we're actually going
to go ahead and we want to like Store
where the the API is going to be so we
going to create a folder called uh route
and then a subfolder called
API and then we'll call a file in there
called users. JS so as we're updating
our scripts we know where to pull the
data from it's just a standard way of
being able to pull out the values so in
here we're going to say um in this
instance Express is
required for our
scripts and we're going to also say that
router within Express
router correct naming
convention and the script is case
sensitive we'll also want to create a
value later on that will have a unique
ID so we're actually going to pull in a
uu ID um package that will actually then
allow us to install um unique
identifiers so we can use node package
manager to install uh uu ID again this
is a great example of how you can go
from nothing to something very quickly
uh with expr uh node.js cuz we installed
Express we installed uuid and We're Off
to the
Races so let's have users require the
path for where our API is going to be
located all right so let's do a basic
get which will be to pull the records
and we're going to have it pull uh all
the records so router. getet and we're
going to require it to pull all of the
records in the Json packet that we
created so there should be four items
that come
back save
that looks
good make sure that users is
consistent there's our Json packet
and yep everything looking pretty good
all right let's go back to
index and we're going to switch out this
function here from just a generic get
with a generic statement to actually
being able to pull in the users so we
have to go app use express. Json
M do
use URL
encoded
extended
false M do
use API users so I'm going to be pulling
them all from the same location
require and where we have our
API
scripts
okay and then let's go ahead and open up
Postman cuz we're going to actually use
Postman to actually show us what the
results look like cuz right now the
results won't show up appropriately um
in our browser window
so postm again is just a API management
tool if you used apog or other similar
tools that are on the market moft um
you'll see it's very consistent again
this is open source and what you want to
be able to do is uh you can actually go
and actually go to the path where the
API is stored and then you can use all
the different types of commands within
uh
your uh environment to be able to you
know test out the scripts so let's go
ahead and create a new project new
request and we're going to go with
default get but there's actually quite a
lot of different commands we can use and
these are just HTTP
commands and we're going to type in the
request and in this instance it's going
to
be let's run our script
first script we're good
let's make sure we're exporting the data
correctly okay so we want to run our
script so let's do node index.js and
that will run the changes that we just
created so we can now come over to get
we select API um Local Host colon
3000 API
users when we do that brings back the
Json package with our four entry
points yeah there's all four of
them so that's your first action now
let's kind of get this a little bit
tinier let's actually go in and see if
we can filter B my
ID so we're going to go in and we're
going to modify our script so it's going
to be route and then we're going to put
in the filter and in this instance it's
going to be
ID which would allow us to be able to
just put a backs slash against the end
of the URL string we just had and put in
a number or a unique identifier and then
that will actually then allow us to pull
in that unique record
[Music]
the data
okay so
found
to take the Jason and print
it so we're going to filter here against
user
ID and then publish the results
else if it doesn't work then we'll just
have a generic error
message we shouldn't see this though in
in the demos we're creating this is just
good
practice so save
that and let's let's go ahead and rerun
our node index file against that um
folder and now we can actually come in
here and we do back slash one and that
will give us just one record and we
could change that to two or 100 in this
instance and if it's 100 we'll just get
a bad request error message there's
two all right so that's get so we'll be
able to pull all the records we have to
filter against one specific record
against a specific parameter in this
instance is it was ID so let's go ahead
and create a new user so what we're
going to do for this is we're going use
the post um command from HTTP to
actually push and post data into the
data source the data source is our
adjacent packet which means that we'll
have to then push a new record into the
Json package using our array
statements because is just essentially
an
array and so we're going to post and
when we do this we have to create a
unique ID so this is where we have to
reference the U ID I'm going to do a V4
unique ID which will be four groups of
four so the 16
characters and then we'll
have
name and email we
post okay that's
good okay
so if new
user put
name
and new
user.
email we want to
return the results
okay and so users do push so we posted
which is a HTTP statement and then
pushing into
the the Json packet
array okay
okay it's looking
good all right so I think we're
good let's go ahead and rerun our script
node
index.js that allows us to do that so
let's go over to postman so we can
actually connect to the URL and we're
going to change the HTTP statement to
post and get rid of that go back to
users now if we just do this nothing's
going to happen so we actually have to
go in and we have to update the body and
this will be the content that'll be
passed through and going to go through
with a raw statement here and we're
going do Json this be that's the packet
we're sending so let's go ahead and the
records we want to update we only have
to update two which is one is name and
the second is email we don't have to do
an ID cuz we're using uid to generate an
automatic one for
us and we're going to create records for
Steph and her email address is Steph
gmail.com yep looking
good okay so let's go ahead and send
that we sent it and if we look at the
bottom we can actually now see that we
have five records so a new one's been
added we have our unique ID at the top
and then we have name and email which
are the ones that we just created for
Stef and staff@gmail.com
all right so that's posting now the next
thing we want to do is to update a
record so that means we need to select
an ID and then be able to update the
content and for that we're going to use
the HTP put
command so we'll use ID as our way to be
able to
filter and then we'll be able to update
against that
filter so construct
found equals
users and
then we have it going
as users ID so we know how to get the
correct record and then pass the record
back onto the screen so we know what
we're
editing so
if so we
found to update the user
and I'm going to go that pull
information from the body for what will
be
updated and for
each diffuser
ID and pass integer
okay so this is our values to pass
against the
ID and in this instance we make sure
that we're updating the values of
username so if we are updating user and
we're just updating the usern name we
want to
make sure that that's the value that
gets
updated and then we also want to do user
email we don't want to update the ID CU
it's going to remain unique and
consistent
okay and we're going to make sure that
everything is pushed to the Jason
package and then we'll also have a
message saying that the field has been
updated in the Json
package okay
all right so we run that script
again and looks good so let's go to our
folder let's change the HTTP post let's
put it as get just so we can see that we
have uh all the values in the array from
the Json
packet and now we want to say put which
allows us to update just one
record so let's go ahead and select one
record we'll select it1 so we have one
record we can go ahead and for name we
can change
this so let's go ahead and change these
so now you see that the email has
changed so we have staff um as the new
account all right our final API that
we're going to create is to delete an
account and in many ways this is
actually a very basic API because what
we're doing is we're grabbing the ID and
they were saying that all the associated
records with that ID um within that row
um as it were in the table just to
delete the whole
row so we want to use again our ID
as the unique value that we're pulling
against
so we're going to if users are found and
we're going to filter those users
I'm going to do that filter against user
ID pass
that
and then go
and post a message to our Jason packet
saying user delete
deleted generic message if things
fail okay save that and we'll see we're
go ahead and we're using we're just
deleting the record
now and we're going to do it by
filtering against unique
ID and then you will then just eliminate
that
record and we'll pass the message that
it has been the account has been
deleted okay so we save that let's go
run our
script node
index.js we're good okay let's come over
here and we can going
to show that we can pull any of the
accounts so let's just take one of
them one that's
good so let's go ahead and we're going
to
change the HTP Comm on to
delete and we actually have
to select an account so we just do one
when we do that it'll actually delete
that record and here we are um it says
Del user has been deleted and we now
only have three records in the Json
packet and we can pull all the
records and you'll see that there's only
three so we being able to uh pull all
the records from adjacent package we be
able to create a record update a record
and delete a
record and we can just step through so
here's our Json package that we got
created originally again this is just an
array it's just a different way of
setting up the array and then we have
our index files which um identifies what
are the apps that need to be installed
and where are the apis going to be
serviced out of and that we're going to
be doing this
on uh the port
3000 um again these are additional tools
that we need to make sure um that we
have up and running um in our script and
so the first script was to get all the
um the records second to filter against
a user ID for just a specific record and
then for creating a record we actually
went in and we used the uid tool to
create a unique identifier and then we
posted in the data for the new records
we did something similar with updating
the record we didn't have to update the
user ID we just had to update the values
in the two fields that we needed to be
updated in this case name and email
and the final step was to go ahead and
delete a record so these are all apis
that you can now pull into your own
applications so you can use them in web
applications or you can actually go
ahead and use them in other applications
such as mobile applications um uh local
applications um other scripts and this
really allows your application to become
more scalable um and more
useful hello we're going to go through
and do our demo of building a restful
API with nodejs so the first thing we
want to do is go ahead install all the
correct pieces of software we're going
to start with node.js so let's do a
Google search on node.js and you'll find
that node.js is at nodejs.org so we
select that
link and that's going to take us to the
nodejs website and there are two
versions of nodejs you can download
There's the stable version and then
there's the uh latest version go with
the stable version you'll find it
available in Windows Mac OS and Linux as
well and if we go to the next piece of
software we want to go ahead and install
the text editor of your choice um I'm
going to use Visual Studio code uh vs
code uh it's an open source solution it
works on all leading platforms uh works
really well I like it a lot Microsoft
did a good job with this uh I also
really like it that it's open source um
but there's lots of extensions you can
get for vs code um so it's a great text
editor and we'll also need Postman
Postman is a tool that allows us to be
able to view the apis that we're going
to create so let's go ahead to post
man.com and again it's another uh
solution you can download for free and
so we're going to go ahead and select
the download button and it will
automatically detect which OS you're on
so in this case it's going to be windows
but you can also get Mac and Linux as
well so we'll go ahead and download
those
and once we have everything installed
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a project in vs code and that's
actually really easy to do all you have
to do is create a
folder and we're going do this right off
our
desktop and we're going to call the
folder node rest API and we select that
folder and you'll see on the uh left
hand column that we have uh the new
folder that we created uh we still have
the vs code welcome screen we get rid of
that we don't need that anymore so let's
go ahead and one of the things I like
with vs code is you can actually toggle
the terminal window so let's go ahead
and open up the terminal window so we
can actually run that at the same time
and so we're going to move our curser to
the folder we just created and there we
are you see
that and what we're going to do now is
we're going to initialize this with node
package manager uh to make this a
package
and just going to go ahead and we're
going to ask for a name we're just going
to go with the default we're just going
to say yes yes to a couple of these yep
enter enter
enter enter enter enter is this okay yep
enter all right so now we have a new
file and this is our Json package it has
all the defaults in it we can go in and
modify these if you want to no need to
for this uh exercise but you may want to
for the solution that you're putting
together and we're going to create a new
file called
index.js and this is going to be the
reference file that was in the Json
package for
mpm and here we're going to put in our
solutions that we absolutely have to
have um for this to run so we're going
to uh install Express and express is a
web service application it's very
flexible and one of the things that
we're going to use it for today is build
apis so in our terminal window we're
going to type mpm install D- saave
Express this will install Express
locally on our
machine and takes a few minutes but it's
going to go and download all the latest
features this is going to be the latest
version of Express you can if you want
to um specify a specific version of
software for these examples uh there's
no need to do that so you'll see that
everything has been installed we expand
the the node module we can scroll down
and indeed yep there we are we see
Express has been install along with some
other um pieces that are
useful all right so that's our first
piece and the
next is we're going to Define our app
and our app is going to use
express and we want Express as a Local
Host on our local machine on Port 3000
so we've identified Port 3000 as the
default um port for our
application
and we are going to now create a an
array for some
movies and we're going to have ID title
director and release
dat deception great
movie and director Christoper
Nolan and that was
released in 2010 yes 10 years ago
okay so we're going to do an a couple of
items here uh just so that we have some
more than one entry in our array and
array is a
JavaScript uh you can think of it as a
very simple uh table it allows us to
have structured data uh you can also do
a Json file you can also connect to uh a
database mongod DB or something like
that
19 okay so we have two movies in our
little array it be more than enough for
right
now uh key part is that we have a
consistent structure for the array of ID
title director and release date and so
we're going to uh create uh two apis
one's going to be a get API where we'll
get the list of the items in our API and
the second will be a post where we'll be
actually pushing in a new item so let's
go ahead and start with the get and what
we want to do is we want to select get
slovie and we are going to have this run
as an API and so what we'll do is we
will test this in a moment U this will
be running from our web browser um
actually we'll probably open up Postman
and run this through Postman
so okay that PS all the
movies and we'll do a another um get in
a moment where we'll filter by movie ID
but let's just get them all for right
now and we are going to
listen on a server port in this instance
it's going to be Port 3000
and we already had defined the port as a
variable earlier um which um so we're
just referencing the uh variable and the
port number is listed at the uh top in
line
four just a text string that's going to
get put to the terminal window
and it is going to
dynamically grab the port the uh value
from the variable form
3000 and place it in our text string
easy and we want to save the file and
now we're going to go ahead and run it
so we're going to do node
index.js that runs the
script and tells us that we're listening
on Port 3000 that's great
that means now that we should be able to
go into
Postman
and grab the data from an API so here's
Postman if you not used it before it's a
great tool for being able to manage apis
strongly encourage you to have a go with
this so we're going to get the get
command and you've done any applications
web applications you probably use get
and post uh for the data um that you're
H pulling and pushing from forms online
same principle so we want to go ahead
and we're going to go and grab get we
type in Local
Host and it's going to be call on
3000 SL movies that's the the name of
the
file and we're going to hit send and
what we get as a response
is
the data in our
query sorry in our array here we go
there so there's our array and the data
values have been pulled back by
Postman that's
great so now we want to go ahead and add
a movie to our
array and we're going to do that we're
going to use the post
command and get and post our HTTP
commands and so we're going to use
movies and in this instance we're going
to push the
value
into our
list so construction movie requires
we're going to need um a structure here
and that structure is going to be
the information that's in the the body
and then we're going to push to the log
our terminal
window and push so here we're using push
and that's a term in for arrays within
JavaScript where we push the data into
the actual array itself
there are lots of ways of being able to
control data within an array uh if
you're new to arrays with JavaScript I
strongly encourage you to uh learn more
about them there's just awful lot you
can do with them and then we want to
have a validation uh message come up on
the screen saying yes movie has been
added to the list so we'll save what
we've just created we don't save it
won't show up and then we're going to
rerun the node index. JS
file you see this is we've created here
already a an API that allows us to pull
and push data in and out of a
variable okay so let's go back and we're
going to change the header from being
get to being
push so we're going to use uh sorry not
push a post so we're going to se post
and then what we want to do is the value
inside of the body and so let's go
over and we want to CH select
body and we're going to put in
text and select Json so it's going be
structured and so here we will
essentially copy the structure we have
here so let's go ahead and
just copy these elements
and we have to give it an ID because we
don't have an autogenerated ID so we're
going to make this ID
three and
then and it's going to be a number
three and then we want to put
in title
new movie I'll put in
[Music]
direct and we have this
as I don't know new director not very
creative here
today and
then we need to put in a date
so release
dat let's just put in a
date today's day will
fine um just so you know that we're not
formatting the
datcon so let's go ahead and we'll s
send and this will actually go and we
can see Bel boom movies been added to
our
list and we can go go back and let's go
ahead and validate that so we're going
to change from post to get use the same
and now we go to
below oh looks like we put an error
in our
formatting so let's
go
to pass the Json
and we want to pass it using
Express and this
will clear up any formatting
issues so app.use Express
Json
Express URL
encoded extended false
and that should help us pass our
value and then we'll rerun that script
make sure you save the previous file
otherwise you won't run the new script
all right looking good so let's go back
and let's go back to
our locost
3000 movies
and there's only two values here so what
we need to do now is change from get to
post we'll go to
body and what we're going to do is we
want to have raw Json and what we want
to do is capture the values that we have
below and insert
this file into this new Json packet into
our
array we actually just copy
that it's a little bit cheating but it's
same so let's go ahead
and get everything
consistent and we change the number to
three we create a unique type
actually sorry new title it doesn't need
to be unique just the ID needs to be
unique so title new
movie director change it to New
director we change the
date I'm not doing any formatting on the
date so can be any any date any number
really hit save movies been added to our
list woohoo so it's been added but now
let's go back to get and let's see if we
can actually see the third entry and
scroll down and there we are we've
actually pushed that uh Json package
into our
array so we now have three items in that
have been added VI our
API
Okay so
now let's go ahead and search our Movie
Database uh yes we only have three
entries but you know we want to be able
to so we can do that by using the get
command and what we'll be doing is we'll
be validating against a specific ID
number uh so we have three and we're
going to validate against just the ID
number um in this instance um the way to
do it is through the URL so beforehand
we had logo host colum 3000
slovie now we're adding in slash mov
slash and then whatever number after
that will actually filter against the ID
and that's essentially what we're doing
here right
now so we're going to go into if
movies do ID again we're using the ID
value to actually pull from our array
list with my variables and arrays mixed
up here
today and then once we actually have the
value we'll actually post back as a Json
pack and if we have any errors then what
we'll do is we'll throw up message movie
not found so there we are we're going to
pull against an
ID and we should be able to then pull
that up through Postman into our
terminal window again the reason why
we're using Postman is that this is
actually just showing the values going
back and forth we're not having to
render a whole web page uh it's
extremely fast very efficient
all
right so we saved and rerun our script
all right let's go back and what we're
going to do is we're going to change the
value so we're going to hit send here we
are we see all of our movies using the
get command now what we're going to do
is we're going to use a look filter on
just uh id2 which is the Irishman so do
slash2 and there we are we have just the
information on the Irishman so now you
can see how you can create a simple
search all
right so the final action we want to do
is to delete a
record in our array and so we can go
ahead and do that and we're going to use
the uh Delete command to actually do
that so uh We've be able to push um in a
a record we've been able to view records
filter records now we're going to go
ahead and do delete and so we can do app
delete and then we're going to filter by
specific ID
number and when we do this we'll
actually then uh when we put in the URL
path which will be logo host col 3000
mov SL and then the ID number so in this
instance either one or two probably use
two that will then uh delete from our
array the record for the Irishman
[Music]
save I do the shortcut keyboard shortcut
of control+ s to save files on Windows
or command pluss on my
Mac
and once we've deleted a record we want
to send a message saying that the movie
has being deleted all right so we want
to go
ahead and just check our code you can
good save our file and we want to
rerun the index.js
file rerun okay let's go over to
postman
grab the delete
so again we're filtering against the
movie ID and then we'll delete that
ID okay so went against the AR and we
hit
send and there it is now we're going to
change the command to
delete so we hit
one will actually delete Inception movie
has been deleted it's great and let's go
ahead and grab our who get to pull in
all the movies that are listed and it's
not going to find movie number with the
ID one it's not there
anymore and if we get all the
movies we see we only have one movie and
that's the Irishman and so so our delete
function has
worked there we are so we've uh
installed Express we're using Express to
build all of our applications we have
our app running on Port 3000 we are
using Express uh to pass the Json uh
effectively back and forth we have a
simple array that array is then being
used to create an API to pull the
details then we're being able to add a
movie then search for a movie filtering
against an
ID and then we can actually finally go
ahead and delete a
movie all this using
expressjs today we're going to be
covering node.js
authentication using JWT or Json web
Toons so let's get started so why are we
going to go down this part so let's
cover the key things that you need to be
asking yourself such as what is a Json
web token what is the value of using a
Json web token and then what does the
actual structure of the JWT look like
and then let's go through some use cases
of where you'd actually use jwt's uh
both in the Enterprise and uh uh in the
real world and then finally we're
actually going to go through a demo on
how you can actually install a JWT using
using Express and node.js
so let's dive into what actually is
ajacent web token so adjacent web token
is actually based on uh an open standard
um it's one that you can actually go
ahead and research um and it allows a
definition of a compact self-contained
way of being able to securely transmit
information between parties using
adjacent object and adjacent object is a
JavaScript array and it's very compact
it's a very a tight way of being able to
send data back and forth the thing
that's great about using a Json web
token is that the information itself is
encrypted and it can only be um verified
and trusted through a public private key
pair and we'll get into that about how
you can actually get to those so you
know why would you actually want to go
ahead and use adjacent web token aren't
there other formats that you can use
well yes there are other formats you can
use but what's great about JWT is that
it is a great way to be able to pass
data from HTTP servers uh so if you're
building a web application and you have
a web application where you need to pass
uh authentication of using a jw2 is a
great way to be able to do that uh so
for instance you may have a number of
Enterprise applications that run across
your Cloud environment you may have some
uh Enterprise applications that run in
your data center and you want to have uh
people come in such as your employees or
your customers authenticate once and
then be able to have their ID transition
from one to the next uh JWT is a great
way to do that the content is extremely
secure and we'll get more into that in a
moment but um it is the highest level of
security you can have right now and the
final great thing about working with JWT
is that uh the actual tokens themselves
are very well documented and so there's
actually a lot of passes that you can
use so being able to um add in JWT into
your application is very very easy to do
which makes it very easy for you to
actually Implement at a large scale
authentication and authorization and so
authorization is a keyword there um
that's something that you're probably
coming across um a lot instead of just
being able to identify who you are we
want to be able to authorize what you
have access to so let's have a look at
the structure of a JWT there are several
key elements the first is the header and
that's actually going to break down what
kind of token It Is by 2 it's going to
be a GWT token and what is the signing
algorithm so sh 512 is a very complex
and secure algorithm uh suddenly the one
that I would recommend that you use uh
you can even go higher than that but sh
512 is a great place to start and then
you have the payload and the payload is
the information that's been actually
encrypted within the web token uh so in
this instance we have a name the admin
type um sub name um just really you can
put whatever kind of information you
want in there as long as it's applicable
um to the uh service that you're passing
the data into and then you have your U
signature which is um encoded header um
and payload with the algorithm that
you've sent so in this instance it's sh
512 algorithm
so let's look at some of the use cases
that you'd have for
JWT so a couple of use cases would be
authorization so say for instance uh you
have a application and you want to be
able to authorize somebody to have
access to different parts of the
application um JWT is a great way to be
able to encrypt that data and be able to
pass that data back and forth uh
examples would be jumping from different
parts of his 365 and be able to um have
access to different uh features within
the system and then another area would
be if you're doing information exchange
so information is being securely
exchanged from one person to another so
a blockchain scenario a multi
distributed environment where you want
to be able to have a way to be able to
securely transmit data back and forth
and know that that data is being
encrypted is another good
example so with that let's let's take a
pivot and we'll go ahead and we'll look
at creating a demo uh using our standard
stack of nodejs and we'll use express
and Postman um and these are tools that
you may already be familiar with if
you've seen other videos that we've
created in this series and we'll go
ahead and create a JWT
token so let's go into our demo of how
to create a JWT uh Json web token
there's going to be some tools that we
need need to get started with node.js is
the first so let's go ahead and find
node.js at nodejs.org and you can either
download Windows Mac or Linux code
obviously you'd install the one that
would be for your operating system uh
the next tool that we want to install is
a text editor we're going to use Visual
Studio code or vs code go to code.
visual studio.com download this this
will run on Mac windows and Linux uh
really great text code editor and then
we're also going to use Postman Postman
is a tool that allows you to access and
view apis that will be creating with
Express and you go to post.com hit
download and again there's versions of
postm for all leading operating
systems and have those installed and up
and
running so we're going to go ahead and
let's open up visual studio code
and we're going to start by creating our
project Let's Go full screen on this get
rid of the welcome
screen and let's going open up a folder
where we'll actually have our project we
going to put this on our desktop for
right now let's go create a new folder
and we'll call this node
[Music]
JWT or Json web token select that
folder and we're going to want to go
ahead and use mpm to initialize this
folder for uh for node and so let's get
rid of the W screen again and let's go
ahead and one of the things I love about
VSS code is you can actually run the
terminal window right from in here so
let's go ahead and select mpm in it or
knows to pull from the folder that we're
in and we're just going to select yes
here in a second for
our yep let's go ahead and create that
and you'll see that the packet has been
created and there is a Json packet with
just default information about the mpm
package that we created for
node and we're going to go ahead and
create an index.js file that's what
we've been pulling for the package and
the index.js files we're going to
actually write all of our code and what
we want to do right now is install
Express and express is going to be used
to create the API that we'll be able to
test our JWT against and then we'll also
want to
install a
JWT um file so let's call this Json web
token and from our terminal window we'll
just go ahead and install both of those
and you do that by typing mpm install D-
saave and then we're going to put
Express and Json web
token Express and Json web
token and we'll just go ahead and let
those
install only takes a moment for those to
get
installed all right we're up and running
okay so so let's go ahead and start
bringing in some of our apps so we're
going to create an Express
app and we're going to use the get HTP
header to have everything go from the
we're going to actually have everything
running on our local host and we're
going to run everything off Port 3000 we
do that in a moment here but we'll have
everything running off a sub um folder
called API that's where our web
application is going to be running from
and we'll put in a message that hey
there to show that everything's up and
running
okay
and save
that and save you can do control+ s to
save your files as you can with a lot of
Windows applications and I encourage you
to do that a lot so let's go ahead and
open up post m we going to go to our web
browser on this one and open up
Postman takes a moment to run the first
time and it comes and Postman again is a
tool for being able to manage API calls
um so you don't have to write a
script so here we
go and we can go in here and we can
that's where we're going to WR script
but we have to do a couple things first
let's let's get everything running so we
want to listen on for Port 3000 that's
where we're going to run everything off
of and in the console log we'll actually
throw in a message to confirm that we
are running on uh everything is up and
running we'll just say okay uh server
started on Port 3000
again we're going to be running
everything off Local Host so you'll be
able to see this um and this is as you
imagine just a test environment so let's
go down into our console we'll run this
script node index.js to run the script
runs really fast not a whole lot going
on there and we're having everything
running off the API files so let's go
and we'll type in under our get Local
Host colon
3000 API
and we hit the there's lots of different
HTTP headers um we can use we're going
to use get for right now send
that and hey there welcome to the API
service so toic clear this is just an
API we're creating right now this is not
JWT we'll get into that right
now all
right so we want to be able to post data
and uh post post is actually pushing
data in so we're going to go into uh
going to create a login screen again
this is all API so it's not real but uh
you get you get the
point and then construct a
user and let's go ahead and we what
we're doing here is we're creating a uh
an array of a random user and that they
can have a name of ID one that they have
users going to have ID value which is
one um a username value which is going
to be John and then email value of John
gmail.com and then we'll make this
a Json web token JWT signning and
they'll have to sign with their
user and this is going to use a secret
key which will be our hat
hash 512
token
and respond to the Jason with the
token Okay so let's see now okay and
we're going
to amp Dot and this will be our
post
API
posts and what we're going to be able to
do is we're going to jump from one app
to another app and you'll be able to see
how we can move the token with
it and the message will read
post
created all
right so let's just run that script
index.js runs real quick okay so if we
come over here and we go to
posts and hit
send and say message post created
good so let's go ahead and try that
again and we want to go to
the
login so we going from one app to
another app select
post and here the
login we should be able to request the
token so this will be our GWT token
token when we hit send we should get our
token and here you can see the the whole
token is
encrypted it's that huge long
line very
unique
and now we want to be able to go in and
say okay let's
verify the token so so we've gone ahead
and we've created the token but now we
need to as we go from app to app we need
to actually verify the token so we're
going to get an error message if we
don't verify the token
correctly so we put in a function to
verify the
token and
and we're going to create a barar
header value which will
be the headers and the authorization for
that and if typ of bar header
I'm going have it if it's not correct
it'll be
undefined otherwise this bar
token it will be split
and we're going to require the
token for our bar
token
else send status
403 okay so bar token is what we're
going to be calling against to verify
our token we show you how that works in
just a
moment and this will be to
authorize and to authorize we'll need to
actually go ahead
and use the token so we can actually put
in here
all right so I think everything's
looking pretty
good and if things if we get the error
message means that it's we'll see the
the message forbidden if we don't put in
the code correctly so let double check
that everything is looking good we going
to verify that the token is required
okay so if it is then
JWT
verify and this
will connect our token
appropriately and we'll be able
to pull that in as a part of our secret
key
and if it is
successful put
in that message there
and we're also going to put in the
authorization
data yep looking
good as you can see a lot of the work is
just making sure that everything is
aligned up
correctly okay so let's run our code
node
index.js there we go nice and
fast
and we going to go in and Local Host API
posts we change this to post so this one
API which is the API posts which is up
here we hit send and you can see that we
have the eror code forbidden has come up
which is what we were expecting because
we haven't been able to put in a secret
key and put in the comment there
forbidden so as we're stepping through
the code but now what we can actually do
is we can go back and we can grab the
token and here is our token below and we
just want the token sell we don't need
the
rappers and copy that
come over
here and if we write again it's going
say forbidden but if we go into author
into our headers we can put in
authorization and then the
value we do barer and then the
key and once we do this we now get all
of the data that we were asking for pull
back which is exactly what we
wanted so you can see here how we can
actually securely use a JWT to pass
values back and forth across the
application
okay and we hit authorization we select
that and approve it yep we keep
authorizing so if you don't authorize
then you don't get the
data okay so we have everything against
the API and we have one application
which called API post we have another
application called API login and we're
able to move the data back and forth
using our secret key and our
JWT
token and we have everything running on
Port 3000 of our Local Host
server and that's our
demo so first of all let's cover why
you'd want to go through this tutorial
so we're going to cover what my SQL is
we're also going to tell you how we're
going to connect with node.js and why
you'd want to do that with my SQL and
then finally we're going to do a demo
taking you through all the steps on how
you can actually do that kind of
connection so what is MySQL well
basically MySQL is probably the world's
most popular relational database um so
if you think of relational databases
that are table driven MySQL is arguably
the most popular database out there for
rdbs systems it is by far the most
popular open source uh relational
database the entire database is written
in C and C++ it's been around for a
really long time um again it's open
source which is great um which means
that there are no licenses or costs for
actually using MySQL and you'll find
that companies of all sizes from small
mom and pop shops all the way up to
massive enter Global Enterprises are all
using my SQL so you know why would you
want to then take that next step of
connecting no GS with myle well
fundamentally it comes down to the
basics of the differences between the
two products uh myle is a database and
node.js is a architecture framework for
building out web applications um again
with mySQL it's open source it's free to
use you don't have to pay anything there
are no licenses which if you compare it
with other Solutions out there is a big
deal my SQL even though it is open
source is incredi powerful it's one of
the more mature open source programs out
there I think Apache is probably
arguably more Pat at web server is
probably more mature but uh my SQL is
very close behind it so it has had a
huge amount of investment this is not a
solution that's only a couple years old
we're talking about a solution that's
more than 15 years old very very
structured very powerful um and you can
do a lot of really good things with it
um you can actually then um build
Solutions with it um using PHP Java
really any kind of database um even um
other um systems and other Frameworks
will allow you to interact with my SQL
and it just allows you to work with just
huge amounts of data very very quickly
so let's go through a demo of how you'd
actually use nodejs and
MySQL so we're going to go ahead and
we're going to get started by putting
our environment together so let's start
by selecting node.js and downloading it
so we go to nodejs.org
and there you have your options for
Windows Mac or if you want to go for the
source code you can go ahead and
download and install
that the next is to install zamp and so
we're going to go to uh zamp installers
for a quick search and that's on our
Apache friends.org site and here we have
zamp Windows Linux and micos 10
and then finally we want to go
ahead and install visual studio so
visual studio is going to be our IDE our
integrated development environment in
this instance we're going to use Visual
Studio code you not use visual stud code
uh it's a great free open-source
solution for being able to build
applications um I'm a big fan of it so I
encourage you to use
it and go ahead and download install
that
and we have visual studio um code up and
running so go ahead and we're going to
open up a new folder and let's go ahead
and create a new folder we just put it
straight off our desktop here and it's
Just for kicks and Giggles so we just
type in node my SQL for our source code
and we open up that folder and select
that and so we now have this folder
selected in our Visual Studio code
editor and what we want to do is we want
to get rid of the welcome page we don't
really need that anymore and we're going
to terminal window so we can actually
see the scripts that we're writing we're
going to be using terminal quite a bit
um in this so for instance we're just
going to test that we have mpm installed
we do so that's
great and we're going to go mpm in it
and that's actually going to set up our
own node package module and we can
actually see that the the Json file for
the package has been created so we go in
there we can see that all the default
defa
selected now you'll see that index.js is
the default file that would be created
so we're actually going to go ahead and
um we're actually to create our own
index.js file and we're going to add in
some instructions into that file to
actually install the correct software
from the MPN
package and the first thing we want to
do is install
Express which is a package that's great
for building a lightweight web
application not mobile applications I
suppose if you're doing a responsive
design then I mobile but in this it's
really it's a a web application
environment so we're going to put in the
requirements for that and then we're
going to also go and require that my SQL
gets
installed and uh uh you'll see that for
both of them we're just going to use
mpm's default commands for creating that
and we'll go down to the terminal window
and we'll do mpm
install and it's going to install the
express and my SQL
environment and as that installs you
actually see on the left hand side under
uh the folder you'll actually see the
files starting to be installed U so for
instance we have the node modules and
underneath that will be all the
subsequent files that we
need and there we are everything is
installed all right so this go ahead and
validate some of these commands make
sure everything is installed so we're
going to open up zamp which allows us to
go in
and View and see that everything's
install so we have my seqence inst we
have a patch installed we can start and
stop the
services with Zam go ahead and do that
you can do this through T window as well
but the uh UI interface is really nice
so let's go
into my SQL um uh inter face and you'll
see that we don't have any
databases these are all just the the
standard test databases and so we have
to go ahead and create
one and so
let's get our SLE database connection
created so we're going to write um con
DB equals
MySQL create connection
and we want to connect to the Local Host
in this
instance and user is just going to be a
root user account which is the standard
user account that comes from my SQL uh
there is no password for the root user
when you're running it locally I
encourage you to change that as quickly
as you can because you don't really want
to have a password free environment
and now we want to be able to then
connect to the
MySQL
environment so do WR db.
connect uh parentheses error and we want
to throw an error message if the
connection isn't good so if we do
error we will throw the error message to
the log window
and if we don't then we'll write my SQ
connected all
right and then we want to connect that
to our Express
the next step we want to do after we
made our connection is to go ahead and
create a database so we do both steps at
the same one so we're wrun the script
right now and then we'll run the
commands uh in the terminal window so we
can actually create a
database and so we're going to go ahead
and we want to
create um a
database and right let SQL
equals
create
database I'm going to call the database
node my SQL you can call it whatever you
want um but this is just a a node my SQL
script
DP
query
SQL error
through our
message rest.
send database
created so we'll throw a message saying
that database has been created let's go
save that to demonstrate that we've
connected and we created so let's go
ahead and we do node
index.js to run that and we connect to
my SQL that's great good first step and
then we'll go to the window and we'll go
to Local
Host 3000 which is the
default connection but what you'll see
is that we've actually created the name
of the databases we changeed to node my
SQL so we've got an error message which
we expected and so what we're gonna do
is we're actually G to go ahead
and we're GNA say you want to
listen and if the error message if comes
up to
3,000
then in the console window we want
to put a message of St started on for
3000
so let's try that
again node
index.js yep and server has started in
42,000 refresh
that I'm still getting an eror
message and what we want to see is let's
go ahead you see our database hasn't
been
created so let's go and connect to
database database let's go ahead
and create DB on 4 3000 all right so by
doing that we write that command and
that function and that goes ahead and
creates our database and let you see
that we have now node MySQL has been
created great first
start now we have to go in and create
some tables because we have no tables in
here
all right so let's go down and let's go
ahead and create a
table so what you're seeing right now is
that we're using the index.js
environment within a package on node.js
to actually create and control
everything that we want to see in our
windows so all of the work that we're
doing creating a table for creating the
database um for initializing the core
files it's all being done through JS and
so here we are we're going to create a
new table you call it create it's going
to be called the employee table and so
once we run the command create employee
it's going to create a table has the
employee fields which is going to have
an ID which will be an iner that will go
into Auto increment it'll have a name
field and we'll also put in designation
field
and we'll have a primary key as
well keep it very simple right
now and let's just put our DB connection
so that everything connects effectively
okay so if everything goes correctly
then we'll have the message employee
will
created so let's test this
out and note to IND next
CH make sure that the data we have now
actually a database field that we can
connect to so we've got n my SQL so
we're connecting to the correct database
we get an
and then we'll try that again yay to
database so database has the
name and because got no my sequel
there's no fields in there yet so let's
go ahead
and put in create employee fields and
that run the function that creates new
table and then voila we have a new table
and so the next next action we want to
do is actually populate the table with a
record so this starts becoming familiar
so we're not going
to put in a a single record we call
employee one right now and we'll write
the the function and employee one and
when we run that
function uh it'll actually go ahead and
create the it'll actually insert the
record into my SQL
and the the name will be Jake
Smith and the
designation will
be a chief executive
officer certainly you to put your own
self name your own name into this make
yourself your own CEO because why
not and we're going to make this as an
insert record we going to insert into
the employee
table and just using some basic sqle
scripting here
and what you'll see actually with Visual
Studio code is that it's actually
providing a lot of prompts to make it
easier to write your
code Microsoft is looking to actually
add some AI to visual studio code to
actually start autoc completing scripts
which even easier to write your code
right so let's go run node
index.js we see got everything connected
and we'll grab the function employee one
and let's go over to our Express site
let's just go and we'll insert the
command employee
one employee has been added and we will
just validate this by going back to my
SQL we refresh it and you'll see we
click on the employee table we should
now have an employee in there yep there
we do Jake
Smith hold on Jake first
record all right so we want to be able
to now is select the
employee so let's go ahead and do that
and we want to be able to easily get the
employee
list so let's use our SQL command and we
do select star which is everything from
the employee table so we're actually
ping everything from the employee
table I'm going to query the database
let's throw a message to confirm that
the query is
successful we'll put everything in the
console
all right let's give this a
well okay so let's go and run our
[Music]
Command Local Host 3000
put get
employee and it's say employee details F
now we go to the console window St here
yep there we go we have now all the
packet information including the ID
about Jake
Smith okay so let's go ahead and see if
we can actually update the employee
information so as you can see now we're
starting to run into just our standard
SQL commands and so we want to be able
to update the employee from a
browser and as you can tell we're not
using uh any forms or any other typ of
Records we're just simply interacting um
with between both the uh the browser the
server and uh the database
and the new name will be updated
name make sure we're updating your
appropriate record
sure that we're matching against ID one
[Music]
J Smith is there now go and select
[Music]
col1 we've now G ahead and
updated the Jake Jake Smith information
so let's click on table and we now see
it says updated name I know not very
Crea but it allows you to see a change
and finally you can go ahead and delete
the record as
well so it's going to be SAR to update
but deleting
instead going to
delete the record the employee
table where name equals or ID equals
sorry
[Music]
and and then we want to be able to show
that the record has been deleted
[Music]
[Music]
play employ deleted and we go
to database
wec employee table that there are no
entries the one only record that was
there has been deleted
and so this shows you how you can very
easily control everything from using
your connection into myql right from
node package
manager you can create a
table you can select your
records you can then update any record
that you
selected and finally you can delete any
record that
you want to be able to
delete so what we're going to do is um
so what's in it for you so in this uh
presentation we're going to go through
three key things you know what is mongod
DB now how do you connect to mongod DB
with node.js
and mongod DB is part of the M Stack so
we're going to cover what the M Stack is
and how it applies to node.js
so what is mongod DB so mongod DB is a
it's a probably the most popular nosql
um database out there it's crossplatform
and um very easy to scale it's available
on all Cloud systems you can also run it
locally which is what we'll be doing
later on in our demo um but it's just a
very flexible database environment for
modern uh
applications it works on the concept of
collection and documents um what you'll
find is uh mongod DB was originally
written in
C++ and it is what's referred to as a
nosql database so this is different to a
relational database which is built up of
tables with rows and columns this is a
nosql database that's simply a lot
faster and more powerful for the work
that you're doing and you're able to use
mongod DB very easy you can actually go
ahead and download it we'll actually do
that as part of our demo so you know why
connect node.js with mongod DB well the
reason why you want to do this is that
mongodb is a modern database um it's not
uh restricted by the the the challenges
of scalability that all relational
databases have um it's really designed
for uh building mobile applications and
websites that scale into the millions
and millions of users so mongodb
probably the most important feature is
scalability uh the performance of the
database base is
phenomenal and it is extremely highly
available for the solutions that you'll
be creating so when you push it out your
solution to the cloud you can almost
guarantee it's always going to be
running you also have the ability to be
able to scale to very large complex U
multi-site Solutions in fact one of the
very first mongod DB applications I
built was a multi-tenant environment and
it just worked really well and you'll be
able to easily deploy your Solutions
across uh Microsoft Azure AWS Google
Cloud uh Etc so you know why do you want
to keep connecting to mongod DB um I
think probably um one of the other areas
that probably is often forgotten with
Monga is just the concept around Big
Data you can I mean when you talk about
big data and you're talking about
absolutely massive massive uh
databases and uh mongod DB is front
Center for all of that you can do your
effective content management and
delivery um it has an effective mobile
and social infrastructure so um by that
it allows you to be able to build out
solutions that can go to all modern day
types of applications and the data is
actually very easy to manage through
your central data Hub and then finally
being able to connect to mongod GB is
very easy um particularly as there is a
client called mongus that makes the
connection extremely easy so you know
finally um let's kind of look into how
 DB is part of the M Stack so M
Stack is a JavaScript stack and it's of
JavaScript solutions that are built for
modern single page applications and
there are four key Solutions in the mer
stack there's mongodb which is your
database Express which is your uh server
side uh h TP environment react which is
the solution for being able to uh create
your Solutions on the client and the
nodejs uh which actually manages the
whole environment it's really an
environment that's designed to make it
very easy to be able to build out modern
day Solutions so mongod DB is the m in M
Express is the E react is the r and node
js
is the end so again as you start working
with um some of our other videos that we
have um here you'll be able to um see
how all of these tools really complement
each other so we've done an introduction
on uh DB really the best thing now
is to get your you know your hands dirty
by actually doing a demo so we're going
actually go through a demo what I would
strongly encourage you however though is
that this demo really does build on a
lot of the other videos that we've done
in this series uh so you really do want
to spend some time on the nodejs video
the node.js for Express video the
node.js for apis video uh really all of
those videos help complement the work
that you'll be doing with this video
here you'll see some real strong
correlations plus a lot of new content
as well so with that we're going to jump
into the demo so let's go our
demonstration on how to use mongod DB
with no. JS first thing we want to do is
go ahead and install node.js so you're
going to go and do Google Search node.js
and that should bring up a result of
going to nodejs.org and here you can
download nodejs for multiple platforms
uh so Windows Linux um Mac OS they're
all supported you can also get the
original source code and recompile your
version of node.js if you want
to now we're just going to install the
windows
version and the next thing you want to
do is install your favorite uh text
editor I'm going to install Visual
Studio code vs code uh it runs on all
leading platforms Mac OS windows and
Linux it is open source you can edit it
um I like it because you can do an awful
lot with it uh just a lot of extensions
uh it's just a great tool all
around so that's the next thing you want
to
install and then we want to go ahead and
we want to go to mongod db.com so we can
install the mongodb
database so you want to go to
software Community
server and you want to then
select the uh mongodb Community server
uh which platform you
want and where it's going to connect
with and you want to select the download
to install that and that'll take a
moment or two for you to download and
get that up and running once you've done
that U we want to go ahead and we're
going to open up VSS code so we can
start editing and um the code that we
need for our new solution so let's go
ahead and create a folder of our uh
desktop that we'll use for mongod DB so
I already have a folder created called
demo just going to select that and then
inside there I'm going to put in node
mongod
DB and select that
folder and that's going to open up VSS
code um it's going to have our folder in
here so we're going to get rid of the
welcome screen we don't need that um we
do want to however open up our terminal
window so we're going to uh run that
that's one the things that I really like
about vs code is you can actually have
your terminal window or command line
window actually inside the uh
development environment you're working
in so you don't have to be jumping from
one solution to another and then we're
going to initialize our package so mpm
in it for the folder that we're in it's
going to create our uh no package
manager it's going to create our default
package and we're going to hit return
that's going to go ahead and start the
process and we're just going to go with
the default default um uh settings that
npm is going to give so just hit return
return return a few times and that'll
get up and running for
you and our entry point for the
application is going to be
index.js there yeah that's our GS
package and there we have everything
this is just the uh the the Json package
that provides the instructions that npm
would use to pass the um the program now
you notice that we have index.js as our
leading file so we actually have to add
a new file here we're just going to to
this one
index.js so we actually have a file that
can be
referenced and now we're going to go
ahead and we're going to actually put in
our uh default application so Express is
going to be required so we're going to
make sure that that uh is included in
our first line of our instructions
and then we're also going to have a path
that's
required and we're going to require
handlebars and these are all part of our
Express
environment and don't forget to save
your file as you're going along and
we're also going to have
Express
phbs and this is going to be our Express
handlebars and we're all going
to
allow
insecure prototype
access you would normally do this but uh
because we're running everything locally
it just makes it easier for you to
actually get all the code
in and then we're also going to add
in our body passer
and these are all the required solutions
that we need to be installed when you're
running this
package and so let's save the file and
then let's go ahead and run it so we're
going to do
MPN
install and we do D- save and this will
install
Express and we're also going to have it
install
half uh
handlebars uh Express
handlebars
um and this is where we'll install
prototyping and we'll also have the body
[Music]
passer installed and we're just going to
run that
this will just take a moment or two to
install all right there we go so we have
everything installed which allows us to
now start working with our
scripts so we're going to create an app
in Express
and we're going to listen on Port
3000 and we're going to have a message
then go to our console
log and we have everything running off
our local port on local host on Port 3
,000 so let's go and we're going to
select node
index.js and shows us everything's
running which is good actually test this
in our web browser if we wanted
to okay so let's start working on our
app so our app is going
to use body
passer and we're going to
encode our request
and the goal here is we're going to
create a file that's going to go back
and
forth to
mongos to mongod
DB so body pass is going to use Json to
encrypt the
content and we're going to do a get
command to get our
results and we worked if you've seen the
API video then we did that here in fact
it's probably a good idea to actually
sit down and look through some of the
other videos that we've created such as
the uh Json um sorry the no J node.js uh
for Express node.js uh for apis and
node.js for authentication uh before
doing this
video uh we're going to create a default
page and it's going to say welcome to
the students
database the principles that we're
putting down here you'll be able to
apply to any solution that you're
creating with mongod
DB and so we want to have a simple
action that we're going
to put on here which is going to
be click to gain access
okay we're going to put in the path and
where to get the list
from
okay all right so here is our basic web
page that we're
creating nothing
fancy but it's going to take you to a
place where you can actually get all the
content now what we're going to do is
we're actually going to go and pull the
content from
manga so run this and we can open up web
browser you'll see what it looks like
just go to Local Host close out these
other tabs don't need them Local Host
3000 and there we see welcome to the
student database click on the database
and you click on if we clicked on it now
nothing will happen so yep nothing
there so let's make something
happen
okay all right so let's begin extending
our app so what we're going to do is we
want
to set the
views and we going do a
join on our directory name
and
app
engine so let going for our views we
don't have an app engine yet but let's
go ahead and we create a new
folder we call that one views and let's
expand
that actually that should be
okay HPS
Express
handlebars and we're going to allow
prototype access for Express
bars so with Express handlebars if this
is new to you it allows you to separate
your content from your
layout which if you have developed with
swift for a mobile application on the
Mac uh using xcode is the same principle
there but for a web
application so we're just um putting out
here some of
our uh default environment settings
and we're going to set our view
engine for
handlebars just checking through our
code it's looking
good okay so that
provides that so let's create a new
folder under our views and this one
we're going to call layouts so again
this is where we are splitting our
layouts
we're going to have a folder called
models at the root of our application
and under models we're going to put in
db. JS so the DB JS file is going to be
where we put our instructions for our
database and so here we're going to go
ahead and we're going to require to
import and is a tool in
node.js that allows you to connect uh to
mongod
DB so we're going to require the use of
mongus and so we're going to do mpm
install D say save
mongus and that's going to run and
install on our local machine so we can
actually test this
out and once we've got this installed
we're going to do is we're going to
start connecting to a database that
we're going to call student DB
okay we're all in already installed so
let's go mongus doc
connect
and we're going to call it mongod
DB
[Music]
and we're going to run this off our
Local Host so we installed the uh
Community version that I was just run
our local host and it's going to run
from the port 27017
and we're going to call this one student
DB so again with our application we're
splitting out all the functionality so
if you want to reuse elements you
can so we're going to have a new a user
URL passer
then we'll make sure we
capture everything
correctly okay so Arrow then we'll send
a message to the console
log and we have either connection is
successful or if things go
wrong error in con nection and then if
there is an error then what we'll do is
we'll have the error message
posted
okay and then we're going to do
require
student. model so this will actually
pull the the model we're going to
create and so what we need to do now is
creating under models we're going to
create student.
model.
JS and this is where we're going to
do our instructions for our student
model so first thing we want to do is we
want to
import uh Express and the student
model so we got let's make sure we have
everything let's capture that so let's
go over to
our student
model all right so let's make sure that
we have everything so we want to have
Mongoose
and I'm going to create a new variable
called student schema this will allow us
to structure what our model will look
like and this will be
a a new
new
schema in using
mongus and a new schemer is going to be
full name and we're going to break
down our Jason's package so we're going
to put in the instructions for what the
schema would look like so
we have the type we have required this
field is
required and the second value is going
to be
[Music]
email type
[Music]
string this field is
required that's the message error
message you want to send if the field
isn't filled
out and our mobile phone number this
will be just a
number and we're going to have
City and sub type will be let's just
make this a string we're just going to
try and keep this simple for right now
is
required all right so here's our
schema looking pretty
good right do
model and connect this to
our student
model so we want to go ahead and save
that
okay create a new folder and this new
folder is going to be called
controllers and we have a new file under
controllers and that new file is going
to be called student
controller.js let's go in and see what
we're going to add
here so we want to import uh make sure
we're running
Express so Express is required for our
controller we also want to set up a
variable for
router so router express.
Router and we want to make sure we're
also connecting with
 so we have a connection to our
Mong
DB and we also want to make sure that we
have connection to our student
model so mongus mongus do
model and our student model and this
allows us to make sure that we
have this student model pulled over
effectively for our controller for our
student controller
okay so let's go to
router
get going render
this and student SL add or
edit we'll come into that in just a
moment so we want to be able to view
Title and this will pull in the
insert
student and we're going to use under our
views we're going to create a new
folder and this one's going to be called
student
and we're going to create a new file and
this one will be add or
edit. JS oh HPS sorry for our
handlebar so you notice we don't have to
put the file
extension uh no JS manages all that for
us so router. poost
so this will be our we're going to get
our content and then we're also going to
post content so the post will go back as
part of our body and there'll be an
ID so we want to then iner insert the
record that we'll be
creating so again if you've been if
you've worked through the nodejs
API video then you'll start seeing that
there's some commonalities here of being
able to insert or update a record and we
actually cover that using just a sample
Json package this really takes it to
that next level
okay okay so we want to put in a new
student record and this will be
student and we're going to have that
full name is going to come from our body
and we're going to also capture the
email essentially we're going to follow
the model that we
created and our mobile phone finally
with a student City
[Music]
and then we want to save the record that
we
create
okay all right so we're going to manage
our error
message and we're going to put in
similar messages we put in
before so we want to redirect to our
student
list and we're going to go ahead and
create that in a
moment so let's create a new file
student list. HPS so list.
HPS and
here so what we do is with student list
that's actually going to manage then
the uh control controllers for being
able to um display the records in the
database and then we'll put um our
message if there's an error then you
know we'll put an error message there
and ask it to report the error
message we're going to try and not do
that all right
so now the next step we need to go
through
is we want to call a function to update
the
record and let's go in ahead and we're
going to update the records and we do
the student. find one and update card
okay
okay so we will redirect to our student
list as needed if not we'll throw an
error message to our console
log yeah looking
good and again this is just an example
um but uh something that you'll be able
to do
yourself with a your own
solution
and then we want to like go back to our
list to then
render the
records all
right and here we want to put student
and then we how we're going to find the
record we'll throw a error message to
our console
log so as you can see we always throw an
error message to the console log error
messages are really
useful okay all right looks good save
that okay let's do another router and
this is
to we're going to do the router against
ID so allow us to get the
content so we'll be able to get
information by ID of the student
what you can see is there's a lot of the
work we're doing here is very
repetitive um
and you'll find as you create more
modular code that it makes it easier for
you to write your code and update and
manage your
code okay so we're going
to get our view tit we're going to put
that into our
document
okay all right so our next
router
is we want to be able to delete our
record by a
D and so what we're going to do is we're
going to find our records our student
record we're to find it by ID and then
we're going do find by find ID and
remove
okay so we're going to to once we've
removed the record we're going to
redirect to our list so we can show our
student
list and otherwise we'll send an eror
message to our console
log okay so I think we have what we need
maybe maybe there one more thing oh I
think we need to I think this is
good okay so let's go to our layouts add
a new file there we're going to call
this one main
layout
HBS and here we're going to put the
skeleton of
our web page
together let's write this out so I'm
going to put in our HTML
code
and we're just going to keep this Real
Simple Head
we want to
title and this is going to be students
database we just got
students so we now go
to we're going to try and find out
bootstrap 4 we're going to just grab
that and we're going to
use bootstrap to get started
and there are a couple components
there's the CSS component and then
there's the JavaScript component so
let's just go copy the CSS
[Music]
component and then we're going to just
link that into the header section of our
um web
page so and then here's an example of
different components you can create uh
if you're not Ed if you haven't used
bootstrap before it's an open source
framework originally developed by
Twitter great tool so here in our header
we want to put in the link to the
CSS there's
that
and now we'll need to
also put our own styles
so we've got here some styles that we
created earlier on um for the work that
we're doing you can just paste those
in so we have a box style that we want
to use that will extend the Box style
that you get with
bootstrap all right so we're going to
start working on our body
content class BG info uh so this is
actually BG info is a CSS class file
from bootstrap that you can
use and have the ID of
box and again we're going to
do another
class which allows us for our table
structure
so a little bit of knowledge of
bootstrap is great
here so what we're going to do now is
we're going to put in the content which
we're going to call Body and this will
show up on the
screen so again we're pulling from
records within bootstrap dig through
bootstrap is lots of content there for
you to be able to take advantage of
okay so now we want to be able to add or
edit a
record View
[Music]
Title and the
um the the uh the the French brackets
allow you to be able to pull records and
content directly from the code that
we're
writing so we're pulling title from
insert record and it's part of our
router
command and then we'll put in our
form be student
post I'm just going to do a basic form
here nothing fancy
we will put in the
first record will be a hidden field this
will be for ID we want on to generate
the ID we don't want to have somebody
put that in and then we will put in
our form
[Music]
elements so we'll have first will be a
label it'll be full
name will be an input
field so be text in the input
[Music]
field and again we're using form-c
control which is from bootstrap CSS and
we'll have the full
name and place will be full name so
where we have name there um will
actually match up
with the value that we're putting in our
model so here we have student for name
so we're matching everything up to the
model that we
created okay so let's do this for our
remaining form
elements and again as you see we can put
this together really quickly
so we're going to put in for what will
be
email then we'll do
mobile and City
and here we keep
[Music]
going in for group
and be able to have the type
of tool putting in Mobile
so as you can see because we're using
just standard HTML here you can actually
reference external libraries such as uh
JavaScript libraries for uh formatting
the field that you're in regular
Expressions things like
that and let's put in our final value
which will be for
City and normally when I'd be writing
this um by my hand I would actually be
copy and pasting uh sections of code and
just changing the values as
necessary just to make it easier on
myself but here I'm just typing out
everything for you so you can see the
the whole process
okay all right so there are our
values course remember save your files
as you're going
along everything looks
good and we're matching up our
values with our records
and we want to have a button that allows
you to submit
you also want to have a button to select
view all if you want to be able to view
all the records
okay looking
good okay so go back over to list now we
want to be able to pull our records
so this will
display the list of students
in a
table
right let's go ahead and format that
table so we're going to put together our
format here but then we're also going to
add buttons at the bottom so we can
actually add a record to the database of
we want to add or delete a particular
record from the database
going to call this
one create a new student record for our
student list
I'm just going to type all this in for
you and you'll see how we put
placeholders for the values as we put
them
in these are our table
headers
okay put body content
and what we're going to do here is we're
going to add
in an element that allows you to create
a row for each item listed so if you
have two or more items they'll appear as
an individual row on here and again what
we're doing is we're pulling in the
values to be able
to pull from the model that we created
earlier on so this being the data that's
been submitted so we're going to have it
pull in the value for the email full
name and mobile and
City we're not going to show
ID so it's pulling out all of this data
that we created earlier
on so we have everything posted into our
list as
documents so let's go into a HPS file
and it's our
list let's put in
our final entry
here this will be for City
then this is just a
placeholder the
end of the
list oh yeah you know what we're going
to do is we're can add
[Music]
in reference for the
ID so if we want to edit the document we
can and then we want to do the same
thing if we want to delete the
document so HRA
equals
student and then just
delete now delete based on the
ID there we
go passing that instruction
over
[Music]
click
simple I'm going ask him are you sure
you want
to delete if somebody clicks on the rec
they hit cancel then won't get deleted
if they hit okay and it will get
deleted this is what you can actually
write JS in
line
okay and then we want to close out where
the row will end so how each opens and
closes the
record just titing up some of the HTML
there save
that okay looking
good back to our root index
file so see
now we want to also require
our
model and
[Music]
then we have our student controller also
be a
require of where it's going to pull the
student controller
from okay
and this is just an instructions on
where we can actually find
content okay looks good so let's do node
index JS everything's saved going to
rerun
everything and we got an
error let's go check out where our error
came
[Music]
from so let's go in to our f
[Music]
this is one that we created
so error is
[Music]
in controller see where's the
eror oh we need
to have our mod we need to export our
module to our
router right let's go open up
database we can start seeing where the
records
are just installing the latest updates
here so we need to go ahead and our
connection string so on Local Host
that's the
port let's just double check that make
sure we're completely in line so here's
our database connection
and there's our port and student
database and we did this with
mongos for connecting to so I'm
going to
connect and here are where our records
are being
stored so we're going to create a
database and we're going to call this
database it's going to be called student
DB
so student DB sbk
sensitive and col name is
students let go ahead and create a
database so there we are there's our
database
and let's go run our index JS
file and everything was
successful this is
good all
right so everything should have
passed successfully good good good
database connection is
good so let's go to Local
Host and here we are so we can start
actually navigating through our
application so we see we have our setup
we have no records so let's go ahead and
create
one and we go through you can actually
start stepping through the different
layouts that You' created so here's our
layouts separate to our code so there's
some spacing we probably need to add
there so let's go ahead and just add
that and let's rerun our
code this is the fun bits where you know
everything is just tidying up okay so
you know
it's puts in one one space because we
didn't put in the actual HTML code for
creting multiple
spaces so we're going to go in and
select insert so let's put
in uh Smith and we do
Smith
gmail.com and let's just put in I know
random phone
number there we go we don't have any
formatting so we could put anything in
there
and the city uh I know where am I um
this I'm in Delhi so submit that hit
submit and takes us to a list and voila
we actually have a list with a record in
and if we go back to our database can
actually refresh it and now we actually
start seeing our records being created
and we see the ID is automatically
created and there's our
records okay let's go
back and now we can select edit we can
edit the record so let's change our city
to Bangalore hit
submit all right city is now
Bangalore and if we want to we can edit
again and so this is pulling in yeah if
we do a delete it's going
to ask us do we really want to
lead
okay A little bit of formatting apply
there and the records are all good so we
make that Smith
Jones but because we need to hit submit
we would update the
record so we hit submit updates the
record
we hit delete it's going to say are you
sure we say yes we
are and
ah it
has can grab that record okay so let's
go back at my
code
and because we have everything separated
actually now just go to our student
controller and we'll find our
delete go delete and we had
a um we had a couple of minor errors
there this where it's good to test out
your
code okay let's run that
again and refresh
everything so we go to our database
we're going to go create a new
entry let's callose This One S John John
gmail.com
we'll put in the phone
number you see the the formatting is
just playing
from
um our uh bootstrap so there we have
there's John do we want to delete they
say yes booom yeah easy there we got it
all solved and we hit refresh the record
should be gone yep it
is and so we've created an application
where we can update
applications we can create an
application we can list all the items
and we did all of this using um just
open- Source Solutions through no. JS
and that was with using express some of
the components that come with Express uh
uh mongod DB for our database and then
 to connect to our database we're
going to be going through some of the
simple questions that you would be asked
during a node.js interview let's just
get started so the first question you're
probably going to be asked is you know
you know what is node.js you know you
know what it's for and essentially
nodejs is an one of the most popular if
not the most popular open- Source
crossplatform JavaScript programs um it
allows you to build out web applications
that run on the server it's extremely
flexible it allows you to implement a
lot of solutions outside of just the the
core programming runtime and it allows
you to build Solutions extremely quickly
in an open-source mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client siiz web
applications we'll see this later on and
you may want to talk a little bit about
using expressjs and how you can build
out apis uh to work with nodejs and
connecting to databases such as mongod
DB and that is also really good for
being able to store um a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model um and this
is important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly so you're going to then ask be
asking you how does node.js work well
node.js itself is actually built on the
V8 engine and the V8 JavaScript engine
is the same engine that runs JavaScript
in your Chrome web browser extremely
fast um it allows for um high output and
nonblocking through your IO input
outputs and is a single threaded event
Loop so you're going to be then ask you
know where can you use nodejs and and
the reality is the applications for
nodejs keep expanding um but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now uh so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications i' probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point um because
here you can actually talk about maybe
some examples that you've where you're
building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and prepering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or uh training
examples that you've done the fact that
you've actually worked with nodejs and
created a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
nodejs with the practice of working with
node.js
so be asked about you know your
essentially the iio refers to the
transfer of data in and out of uh a
system and that's really it you know
there's a reason why Google calls that
conference iio it's the transfer data in
and out of our brains at that conference
the application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked um whether it's on
a physical device and network or files
within a system again it's input and
output so let's go through and you know
you're going to be asked you can you
explain the difference between front-end
and backend development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients um yeah people get
really confused about what is the
difference between front end and backend
development um bottom line front end is
what gets resolved inside of your web
browser or the app on your uh mobile
device back end is what gets resolved um
essentially um what we call the know the
back office or server side applications
but it's becoming more and more
synonymous for what gets run in the
cloud so web applications um really get
a lot of the functionality of a web
application gets run in the front end
and I think with CSS HTML 5 uh client
side JavaScript it's all going to get
run in the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database um gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know um anything that's going
to have like Graphics is going to be on
the front end uh apis are going to be
run on the back end and then just
finally some of the scripting languages
that use on the front end uh so HTML CSS
JavaScript those are all Common Core
scripting um languages that you would
use you can use Frameworks such as
angularjs and reactjs or Vue uh those
would be front-end Frameworks uh backend
Frameworks would include Java PHP Python
and node.js are some of the backend
Technologies you could also throw in
there net as well I it's just a whole
you know Litany of frontend and backend
Technologies and Frameworks that you can
use um and this is a actually a good
point to kind of explain the experience
you have outside of just working with
node.js but other technologies that
you've been working with that
potentially that the client is also
using so another question you're going
to be asked when you're looking at
nodejs is you know can you tell me about
npm and so when somebody asks you what
is npn the first thing you going to
respond is do you mean node package
manager and the reason why you want to
respond like that is that you want to
qualify that question with understanding
that you know what they're talking about
but you want them to verify that and so
node packet manager is mpm and it's
responsible for packaging all of your
modules that you're working with in
node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on nodejs and
every single one of them uh includes
references to
mpm so you're going to be ask you know
so okay you told me um what it is you
know can you go into a little bit more
um details you know can provide two main
functionalities and so one of them is
being able to manage online repositories
of modules and packages um so you can go
to like search. nodejs.org and you can
find packages that you can install into
your uh solution uh such as
expressjs and it also provides a command
line utility that allows you to manage
uh your packages very quickly uh through
terminal window or command line I use vs
code a lot Visual Studio code and it has
a command line utility built right into
it that allows me to interact with
mpm so what are some of the modules in
nodejs and so you know modules um in
nodejs they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you you can
think of some of the uh JavaScript
libraries that you may have used the
functionality is somewhat the same but
they're designed for node.js and to run
on the server and there are ways in
which you can go ahead and create some
of those modules so for instance
if we're creating a web server you can
actually use the require commands to be
able to require that the server be there
so the example we have on the right hand
side uh shows that we really do need to
have HTTP which is a web server we
require that to be installed and uh so
that if you're running that uh npm
package it will actually install the HTP
server and then uh you can actually
write some code to actually then listen
on uh the Local Host Port 2000 for where
you'd be running your
application and there are just you know
there's a whole bunch of modules that
come with nodejs right out of the gate
and here are some of the modules that
you have we also referenced just earlier
on HTTP is a core module for running a
web server uh you have a utility
function that is useful for developers
to um assess and features within your
node.js project you have a URL module
for any URL passing you'd be doing and
you also have a stream which allows you
to be able to stream data in and out of
your system and be able to manage how
that's being worked and then zib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep uh your
storage of files um to a
minimum so a question you're going to be
asked is you know why is nodejs being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly with
Java it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know PHP um runs some of the the
most powerful and largest websites out
there such as Facebook so why would you
use node.js well the first response is
kind of a gimme but it is really fast
and if you watched any of the videos
that we've done on nodejs building out
Solutions and and developing the
solutions you'll see just how fast it is
um the second is the really kind of the
secret source with node.js is the node
package manager and node package manager
allows you to install additional
functionality such as Express or
as a database into your solution really
quickly and there's over 50,000 bundles
available for node package manager
if you're building out a realtime
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great is really
the great solution for you allows you to
build out these Solutions really
quickly and there is a easy
synchronization between the server and
the client due to the
codebase and then finally because the
structure of node.js is Javascript if
you are making the pivot from being a
frontend web developer to node.js it's
just going to make it a lot easier for
you to pick up node.js because you have
that common language of JavaScript and
on top of that JavaScript is the world's
most popular um scripting
language so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular and nodejs
and so the reason why this question may
come up is the person interview you is
seeing whether or not uh you do know the
difference between a frontend uh
framework and a backend framework and
this is one of those questions where you
can go well there are differences but
the differences are because they
complement each other um so angular is a
front-end development framework whereas
node.js is a server side framework other
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and
C++ angle is used for building out
single page uh client side web
applications and so that's a key word
there is client side whereas nodejs is
about building out fast and scalable
server side Network applications uh so
uh again the two complement each
other uh angular splits web applications
into the mvcu model view control
component
whereas nodejs generates a lot of
database cre it does more than that as
well but you can think of node.js as
that glue to your
database so let's talk a little bit
about when you're connecting to a
database with node.js and so um you're
going to probably be ask you know what
is um the most popular database used
with node.js and there are a couple um
mongod DB is largely the most popular
nosql crossplatform database
MySQL is also very popular and that's a
more traditional relational
database um you would go with mongod DB
for really more modern solutions when
you're looking at creating application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses um of data
that has to be uh created read updated
and deleted very very
quickly for some of the other popular
libraries that you use for node.js
expressjs is a very popular one um I
really like working with expressjs
allows me to build out web applications
really quickly um more importantly it
allows me to build out apis very quickly
and which you know apis are essentially
web applications themselves um but being
able to do that very quickly with a
framework like expressjs is very useful
U mongus is an application that makes
connecting to database really easy
so um here is an example of expressjs
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and mongus which is a more focused
solution um which allows you know you
make it easier to connect to your
databases so you know what are the pros
and cons of working with noj there's
lots of ways we explained this earlier
on that you can actually build out
applications that run on the cloud why
would you you know what's are the pros
and cons so a pro is that uh node.js is
extremely fast at processing an event
based model uh it really is fast a con
is if you have something that is a very
heavy computational task it's not so
good at that um now I will cavey at that
this is that no JS is getting better all
the time and so uh you might have to be
provide an example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that may be something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can then
offload uh the task to another solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro uh
JavaScript is uh used for building out
your application
with no JS great lots of people know J
JavaScript a restriction and again this
is evolving as JavaScript itself evolves
is that uh when you do a callback you
may end up doing lots of nested
callbacks um if you're doing something
that's very complicated again another
way around the con and so this is one of
the things that I always look for is if
you have a blocker or a barrier how do
you get around that barrier and so for
instance when you're talking uh to your
recruiter you can say look the reason
why I use nodejs is that it's fast it's
event Bas driven I can use JavaScript uh
there are some challenges um but what I
do to get around those challenges are
and that's where you can say that you
know you may run the complex script off
and you may write that in net or Java or
PHP and then use an API to do the
response back into node.js so you get
the benefits of both but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
nodejs uh the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality uh with over
50,000 packages there's a package for
that uh so from being able to have a a
tool that creates unique identifiers
that you might need to have for
generating content that gets posted into
a database through to being able to
connect to databases through you know to
running so many different solutions uh
the mpm package manager with its access
to so many different packages makes it
great for um getting access to all that
content now a con is working with
relational databases with no JS isn't as
easy as a nosql database now you can do
it and there are ways around that and
what I would do when this question comes
up is always kind of pivot to say hey
this is how you can actually then uh get
around uh building out that
application Pro for node.js designed for
streaming huge amounts of data in and
out a con is that node.js is single
threaded so it can be CPU intensive but
again there are ways around that and a
good way around that is uh scaling Your
solution in elastic environment such as
the
cloud so what is the command used to
import an external library and so to
import an external Library the command
is the required command and so an
example we have here is you can start a
variable and the variable is going to be
for HTTP and you're going to then
require the HTTP Service uh that means
that the application itself won't run
unless the external Library the HTTP
library is installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for nodejs let's kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked so
what does event driven programming mean
so event driven programming means that
if something happens something else will
happen in response so for instance if
you click a mouse that Mouse click is an
event that means something has to
respond to that event uh just think of
it as cause and effect it's just the
basic motion of physics so that's what
event driven programming means you also
look at it as a callback function uh so
that when an element is executed
something will happen in
response so what is an event Loop in
nodejs so an event Loop in nodejs is
when you do an asynchronous call and uh
what that essentially means is that uh
you are sending out uh data and then
nonblocking input output uh from node.js
is pulling data back
in what is an event emitter in nodejs so
an event mitter has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects uh
within your event and we have an example
of this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown uh
the functions are then called on that
event synchronously uh so for instance
we have in our example on the right hand
side we create an event and then we have
the functions and that executed in a
series from U that
event so let's talk about the API
functions in NOS so there two types uh
one is an asynchronous nonblocking
function and the second is a synchronous
blocking function and the difference
between the two of them is asynchronous
is that there is no structure to the
order for how the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute uh the response in a series for
how the response is sent to
you so what is a package Json file so
the package Json file is at the heart of
our
nodejs package when we actually will
initialize a solution of folded to be a
node.js uh package you'll find that the
package itself holds all of the metadata
that's particular to the project you're
working on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at uh any
of the videos that we have on node.js we
do have demonstrations within those
videos that actually then go through and
break out um how to create that root
package and you'll see how you can
actually then go ahead and update the
instructions of the metadata within the
package so here we have an example of
what that metadata looks like so again
this kind of continues that question of
what is a package Json file and you may
be asked you know what is the metadata
and why is it important and the metadata
is a basic Json collection of pairing of
a key details such as name version
description and then the custom version
that you put so for instance under name
you could create a name for your project
there can't be any spaces uh what is the
version and description and what is the
main or starting pa uh for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything. JS but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web
application so how would you use a URL
module in
nodejs so with the URL module what it
allows you to do is really two things
one is that it provides the resolution
passing of a URL um for Utilities in
your application and then it allows you
to U extend your module with built-in uh
Solutions and split up the web address
into a readable format
so in this example um we have the URL
and the response it would would give for
that URL which would then be a year and
month um and it would be in a readable
format so it would read out as 2020 and
end of the
month so what is expressjs now you've
heard me mentioned this a couple of
times in the video we actually have a
separate video on expressjs um but
expressjs is a web application framework
that allows you to build out Web
Solutions uh for both mobile and
traditional desktop right inside of
node.js it's very easy to use um being
able to install web.js is simple as
requiring Express to be installed in the
example that we have here on the screen
it's a full solution of showing how to
actually build out a solution with
web.js uh so in this example you start
off the first two lines uh require
Express to be installed and install
comes from node packet manager then we
have a simple application that will then
send to the browser window a hello world
message confirming that Express is up
and running and then the third block of
content starting with barus server
actually will Define the port where your
application is going to run so in this
instance uh the port is going to run on
Local Host and the port will be Port
8081 and so you can actually go to Local
Host colon 8081 and when you do that
that will trigger the application that
will forward up the message hello world
and it's all coming from
expressjs so what are streams in nodejs
so streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and
transform the readable on streams from
which data can be read uh the writable
streams that you can actually write to a
duplex is a stream where is both
readable and
writable and transform are streams that
can be manipulate the data while it is
being read or
written so how do you update and delete
a dependency so say for instance we want
to install uh something like Express so
if you wanted to install Express what
you would do is you would just write
them inside of your project um you want
to go to terminal window and write in
the command mpm install
Express if you want to update the
dependencies within your node package
man manager to update all of them all
you have to do is write the command npm
update all
dependencies and then if you want to
explicitly uninstall a dependency such
as expressjs uh that's using the
uninstall command and so that would
again be going to terminal window and
you would type mpm uninstall
Express and again it's really easy to
create a simple server in node.js that
will run a simple command the HTTP
service is actually built into node.js
uh you don't need to use expressjs I I
typically use expressjs when I want to
do a web server because typically what I
find is that I will want to go and do
something more complicated but if you
want to do something that illustrates
just the core functionality uh within
node.js you can actually just uh require
the core HTTP service that actually
comes as part of node.js and then you
can actually then go ahead and uh tell
it to create a service and then to write
in plain text a command um or text
string such as this this case it'll be
hello world and that would pop out and
then the final line is to then uh listen
that if you go to a web browser that's
on port1 127.0.0.1
World pop up on your screen so explain
synchronous and non-blocking apis in
nodejs so all the apis in nodejs are
asynchronous which means they are
nonblocking which means you can run them
continuously um and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why noj can scale so fast and
the a means that the apis can return
data send data after it's been called
and really increase the efficiency of
events they are triggered within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example uh it's actually something that
can be done very quickly in this example
we're actually uh making a command to
logo host and an app that's running on
Port 3,000 and then depending on what we
get if there's an error message uh then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if uh we get a response to an
application uh then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response uh so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function uh to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package in a single
file and then you can then share that
with other developers so you're all
working from the same
environment so what is a callback
function in node.js a a callback
function is essentially that once you
run and you've triggered event and the
response has been given uh you want to
be able to then have a call back to
validate that the task is complete all
right let's move on to the final set of
questions which is Advanced node.js
questions so what is reppel in node.js
so repple stands for read eval print and
loop and this is a reference to the Unix
and Linux background that no JS
has so reel will perform the following
tasks the read will be actually uh
passing the JavaScript you'll read that
and store it in memory eval takes and
evaluates the data structure print will
then print the results often on a
console window or onto a web page and
then Loop um Loops the above command
until the user presses contrl C twice
what is the control flow function so the
control flow function is a piece of code
that runs between several of the
asynchronous functions and that's it it
actually controls how those functions
execute so how control flow controls the
function calls and it does it through
four ways one is it controls the order
of execution uh it collects the data it
limits the concurrency and then it also
calls the next step in a program again
this is a management tool for how your
functions are coed within node.js
so what is the difference between fork
and spawn methods in node.js
so the essential difference between the
two of them is that if you use the fork
method it will actually trigger and
create a new instance of the V8 engine
the engine running node.js and will then
run the ification in that new instance
with
spawn it's somewhat similar it doesn't
actually generate a new V8 instance so
it's actually creating a new process but
it's within the same V8 instance as the
previous application that it was spor
from explain to me what is the use of
buffer class in node J so with a buffer
class what you're looking at doing is
you're actually controlling the raw data
of a set of arrays and integers and the
memory allocation outside of the V8 Heap
buffer class is used because pure dver
scpt is not compatible with binary
data what is piping in node.js
so piping is the ability to connect the
output of one stream to another stream
that could be a data stream it could be
any stream that you're working with um
but it does normally get used to pass
data from one stream to
another so what are some of the flags
used in the rewrite operation files uh
so R Dash is used for read W is for
opening a file for writing uh a dash is
opening a file for a pending um so the
collection that you have here uh you
don't have to really memorize all of
them but to have a few of them in the
back of your mind is always a good U
reference
point so how would you open up file
using
nodejs so the syntax you would use would
be the fs. open and that would then open
up a
file explain to me what callback hell is
uh so callback hell also known as the
Pyramid of Doom is when you have too
many nested unreadable and unmanageable
call bags intensively cycle within each
other and they're constantly reading to
each other and they're not able to
resolve the
solution and uh this is a you know it's
a big problem and this is what why it's
called callback H because you're not
able to finalize the the app you're
working on what is a reactive pattern in
nodejs and so a reative pattern is a
concept of non-blocking IO
operations can you explain to me the
test pyramid for nodejs so the test
pyramid and this is standard for testing
uh for all devops is really split into
three key areas you have unit test
integration tests and then endtoend or E
toe tests uh the unit tests are tests
that you actually doing your raw code uh
that you're working on and the goal
there is to be able to validate that the
code you're writing is consistently
working uh integration allows you to um
have tests that integrate your raw code
that you're working within your
application with other areas of an
application and then end to end is the
whole system the whole interface as it
were for your
solution describe the exit codes of
node.js
so an exit code is a specific code that
uh identifies the end of a specific
process and examples of uh exit codes
are unused UNC fatal exception uh fatal
error uh in internal JavaScript
evaluation area these are all good
examples of exit
codes so what is U middleware can you
explain the concept of middleware in
nodejs uh so with middleware it is the
ability to be able to connect to a
system and get data from it um that's
outside of node.js so this may be
executing a type of code or updating a
find request and response to a specific
type of object uh finishing the request
response
cycle can you explain to me what are the
types of HTTP requests that you may use
when working with node.js um there are
actually quite a lot um but four of them
that you might use would be get post
head and delete and these are if you've
done any uh web application before
particular if you worked with forms
inside of a web application you're
probably very familiar suddenly with get
and post uh get is the request to
retrieve data post is generally used for
changing State and data uh head is
similar to get um but also asks for
response if there's no body content so
if you're using if you're developing an
API this would be a good one to use and
delete is used to delete the
predetermined uh
source so how would you connect to
mongod DB database and with node.js and
you use using the client and the
example we have on the left hand side
illustrates
that what is the use of
nodecore EMV and so this nodecore EMV is
an environmental variable that stands
for node environment in Express server
so the example we have on the right hand
side allows you to illustrate how you
would do that for say a production
environment so what are some of the
various timing features in node.js so
the timing functions that you can use
here set timeout and then clear timeout
and you to schedule code execution that
you'd have inside of your
application you also have set interval
and clear interval to execute a block of
code up multiple times in your
application uh set intermediate and
clear intermediate to uh execute code
and that is at the end of your
application and with that we have come
to an end of this video on on nodejs
