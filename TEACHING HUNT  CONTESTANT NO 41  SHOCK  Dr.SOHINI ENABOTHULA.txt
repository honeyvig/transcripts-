hi as parents i'm doctor sohanyan both
intern from online dental college or
woman and today i'm going to discuss
an emphasis about shock and also solve
for mcqs which are
uh repeats in basic pg entrance
examinations
so let's get start into the video now
so what are the contents i'm dealing in
this video introduction definition
classification pathophysiology stages of
shock general features types of shock
dental considerations
management in dental office and finally
summary
okay so what is shock shock is a
pathophysiological condition
clinically recognized as a state of
inadequate perfusion
it is a life-threatening condition
because if it is left untreated
it cannot be reversed and leads to death
of the patient and mortality rate here
is 20 due to shock
coming to definitions davidson gave this
definition
shock is the term used to describe
clinical syndrome
that develops with when there is a
critical impairment of tissue perfusion
due to some form of acute circulatory
failure okay
coming to pathophysiology inadequate
blood flow
leads to inadequate nutrient supply to
the tissues
which leads to inadequate demolish
cellular waste products
and finally disruption of vital organ
functions and death of the patient
occurs
a detailed description of a
pathophysiology will see here
due to inadequate perfusion cell hypoxia
occurs which leads to energy deficient
and lactic acid accumulation and fallen
ph lactic acid lactic acid accumulation
means it is anaerobic metabolism
and due to fallen ph leads to a
metabolic acidosis
and cell membrane dysfunction and
failure of sodium pump happens
and intracellular lysosomes release and
digest to enzymes release which leads to
toxic substances which enter the
circulation and capillary endothelium
damage destruction dysfunction cell that
happens finally
coming to types of shock according to
etiology
shock is divided into hypovolemic shock
septic shock cardiogenic shock and
others like neurogenic dramatic
anaphylactic
which are equally important next based
on the pathophysiology and hemodynamic
changes
block gave this classification that is
obstructive cardiogenic hypovolemic
dissociative
distributive and neurogenic what comes
under abstractive shock cardiac
component
pneumothorax pulmonary embolism
congenital heart diseases
hemorrhage blood loss burns comes under
high power mixture
sepsis anaphylaxis drug injections was
under distributed shock
okay next what are stages of shock first
stage is non-progressive compensated
stage
next is progressive decompensated stage
and third is
decompensated stage where it is
irreversible
so what are the general features of
shock hypertension
tachycardia oliguria colds cold skin
rapid and shallow respiration for other
clinical features look at the picture
fast pulse dizziness enlarged pupils
drowsiness
shallow and rapid breathing excessive
sweating
nausea and vomiting blue or gray
fingernails or tips
cold and calming skin okay
next coming to hypovolemic shock it
results from
decrease in the circulatory or effective
intravascular
volume okay this type of shock is due to
loss of intravascular volume
it is clinically manifested by low
cardiac output tachycardia
and low blood pressure and
vasoconstriction revealed by
coal and calming extremities this is the
most common type of shock in trauma
what are the types two types hemorrhagic
and non hemorrhagic
what are the causes of hypovolemic shock
for hemorrhagic
most common cause is trauma well severe
blood loss is c
and also in gi bleeding we can see this
hemolytic shock
whereas non-hemorrhagic shock it is
caused due to vomiting
burns diarrhea and polyuria okay
next what is the pathophysiology due to
severe blood loss hypolomia occurs
and this decreases the venous return
decrease free load decreased cardiac
output
hypotension perfusion failure and tissue
hypoxia
organ dysfunction and multiple organ
failure this leads to death
coming to hemorrhagic shock it is
classified into four classes based on
the percentage of blood loss
in class one um 15 percentage of blood
loss that is less than 750 ml of blood
is lost
and here blood blood pressure is normal
and mental status is slightly anxious
patients and in class 2 it is also
called as miley shock where 15 to 30
percentage of blood loss is same
and other common features like
extremities are particularly the feet
become pale and cool
sweat in the forehead hand and feet
patient feels
thirsty and cold urinary output pulse
rate and blood pressure remains normal
and patients are mildly anxious and in
class 3 30 to 40 percentage of bread
loss is in disk also
it's also called as moderate shock and
there is a decreased blood pressure
along with the above findings there will
be
oliguria pulse and uh increased pulses
increased but usually less than 100 bits
per
minute okay and patients will be anxious
and confused
in class 4 more than 40 percentage of
blood loss is seen that is more than 2
000
and blood pressure will be decreased and
mental status is confused and lethargic
i'm into treatment first vital signs
must be monitored
and replacement of fluids transformation
of blood or two to three liters of
crystallized is the
most common treatment and such as normal
saline or
no ringer selected solution must be
given lingual slacted solution is also
called
as heart man solution and it consists of
sodium potassium chlorine in the
concentration similar to the plasma
so it is the best and ideal treatment
for hyperbolic shock
in patients with moderate to severe
shock fluid therapy is
monitored by right heart catheterization
which is which is done by
an inflated balloon with a small um
wedging into the
um arterial branch it is done by swan
gans catheter
we'll discuss later cryogenic shock it
occurs
as a result of inadequate cardiac output
impaired oxygen delivery
and reduced tissue perfusion this shock
is caused by
myocardial infarction arthemias
cardiomyopathy
artic stenosis attack regurgitation
mental settle defects okay
this is usually caused by injury to the
heart
okay and in these conditions the heart
mainly the left ventricle fails to pump
the blood okay
what is the treatment for this shock
first identify the cause
and maintain the systolic repression and
cardiac output
most important is inotropic drugs
dopamine is a drug of choice for
cardiogenic shock
and other drugs like norepinephrine and
doll bitumen can also be given
coming to neurogenic shock okay it is
primarily due to blockade of
sympathetic nervous system resulting in
the loss of arterial and venous
tone with pulling of blood in the
peripheral venous system
and which leads to extremities will be
warm okay
generally we have seen the general
features of shock where the extremities
will be cold
and calming whereas in neurogenic shock
due to peripheral pulling of blood
there will be a warmness in the
extremities
okay so treatment includes
excessive volumes of fluid must be
infused and other drugs like
norepinephrine
or phenylalanine phenylephrine can also
be used
so neurogenic shock is probably the only
form of shock
that can be safely treated with
vasoconstricted drug
coming to septic shock this is the most
often due to gram negative septicemia
it may also occur in cases of severe
septicemia
cholangitis peritonitis and or
meningitis
okay uh these bacteria and harmful
toxins
circulate in the blood leads to leaking
of blood vessels
and uh this uh can
this blood enters the organs and causes
the organ dysfunction
it leads to death finally okay this is
the pathophysiology of septic shock
and what are the steps there are four
steps in sepsis
first is cells that is severe and
systematic
inflammatory response syndrome where the
patients will be
more presented with high temperatures
like
more than 100 degrees fahrenheit or with
low temperatures that is
96.8 fahrenheit or below
and desperate rate is increased that is
more than 20
in heart rate is increase that is more
than 90 beats per minute
and wbc account is also increased more
than 12 000 or it also decrease
that is less than 4000 okay next comes
the stage is sepsis
where source plus confirmed or any
suspected infection is present
in the patient and this leads to severe
sepsis where sepsis plus
signs of end organ damage can also be
seen here and
lastly septic shock occurs uh where
severe sepsis is with persistent signs
of
and organ damage and hypotension is seen
here okay
systolic blood pressure is less than 90
degree 90 mmhg
lactate concentration is more than four
millimoles
okay these are the steps of sepsis
coming to treatment of septic shock
first line is aggressive volume
expansion mechanical ventilation
second line is inotropic drugs plasma
expanders can be given
activated potency can also be given
antibiotics and surgical impairment
is must to control the infection and
most common cause of death
in septic shock is hypotension okay this
is a important mcq
and this most common cause of death and
septic shock is
hypotension okay
[Music]
enough electric shock this is seen in
administration of
penicillins or serum or dextrose or any
other anesthetics
okay such shock is usually caused by
bronchospasm laryngeal edema respiratory
distress which leads to hypoxia finally
okay symptoms signs and symptoms include
itching
severe etching prolitis um headaches
edema edema of lip is important is most
common and
sob shortness of breath is also common
and other signs can also be seen
it occurs due to increased release of
histamine and slow release of
substances or other mediators by
combination of antigen
with ige on muscles and vesicles okay
so let's see the pathophysis in detail
uh antigens are
introduced obviously uh this one binds
to
uh which leads to b cell uh production
and plasma cells produce iga antibodies
which goes and binds to the surface of
muscle or basophil
on subsequent exposure to the same
antigen leads to
antigen bridges uh the gap between the
two antibody
molecules degranulation of the cell
happens and release of
histamines and other mediators can also
occur what happens if histamine is
released it increases the permeability
and distension of blood capillaries
occurs okay this is a
pathophysiology of anaphylactic
reactions
and treatment first and foremost is
monitoring of vitals
that is circulation airway and breathing
next administration of epinephrine
subcutaneously and iv anti-hystemics can
also be given
and to reduce the allergic reaction and
oxygen ventilation must be given
okay so what are the dental
considerations in shock
we have seen the types of shock in
detail and now we will deal with the
dental considerations in shock
so uh before starting the treatment we
will get to know the diagnosis and
treatment plan and we'll
get another history of allergic history
of patience and we'll see the systemic
review okay
next i mean l.a so most common uh
allergy component in the la is it's
preservative it is methylparaben
okay this causes the allergen most or
few patients okay
and pain also anxiety on visual of
vision of
dental instruments this is most commonly
seen some patients will be
a becoming anxious on this side of the
instruments
outside of a needle or even sight of
loading the needle also they become
anxious
okay shock and syncope uh due to longer
durations of treatment
okay due to longer durations of
treatment patients will be sitting in
the same position
uh for a long time this also leads to
syncope okay
management in dental offices first if
we see any symptoms in the patient first
and foremost thing we have to do is
terminate the general position then and
there okay
next position the patient in supine
position by
down um lowering the chair and basic
life support must be given if
if any indicated situations are there
and definitely management must be given
by observing patient and
administer any specific drug which
treats the disease
or condition okay and then next
emergency must be
called medical consultation and we have
stopped the treatment there
so we have to complete it so we have to
give the further appointments for the
completion of treatment
this is the basic management of any
medical emergency
next coming to most important topic here
is a pulmonary capillary phase pressure
it is also called as primary base
pressure or cross sectional pressure
okay this is the pressure measured by
wedging a pulmonary catheter
with an inflated balloon into the small
pulmonary
arterial branch it estimates the left
arterial pressure okay
so this is the best indicator for blood
volume and left ventricular function
so normal pcwp value is is in the range
of 6 to 12 mm hd
okay this is the important question that
is the most
uh normal range of pcwp is 16 to 12 mm
hd
okay it is obtained based on glance
catheter here i have mentioned the
diagrammatic picture of first quantum
catheter
it has two ends one end is blunt and
other and we have balloon which can be
inflated or entering into the arterial
branch
and we have therm is a digital port at
the tip and proximal part that is 30
centimeters away from the tip okay
uh diagrammatic question can be given so
take a minute and have a look on this
quantum catheter okay and few more
points on spineless catheter
it is introduced into the cvs mostly
through right internal jugular vein this
is the important question
that is squandered catheter is
introduced into the cvs
mostly through right internal jugular
vein and it is used in sophisticated
centers
to get valuable information about the
precise diagnosis
and circular derangements of shock it
provides three types of information
slow in the cardiovascular system
accurate measurements of blood gases
in mixed venous blood can also be
estimated and feeling pressures of both
right and left when
left sides of the heart can also be
estimated through squandon's catheter
so most important here is normal range
and dynamic picture
and into introduced into the series
through right internal jugular vein
okay next uh let's solve the few
mcqs now okay first question hypertonic
solution is given
on normal conditions except so will come
option wise first is prolonged bowel
surgery
brain injuries and burns next cartogenic
shock
okay in prolonged bowel surgeries and
burns patient
and brain injuries hypertronic solutions
are given
so that they reduces the edema formation
is the most important treatment in
treating this uh
prolonged bubble surgeries and have
brain injuries and brain inspiration
whereas in cardiogenic shock mainstay of
treatment
is administration of anatomic drugs that
is
dopamine development is the drug of
choice for cardiogenic shock
okay next next question fascinating
shock
hypertension syncope tachycardia
and hypertension so in shock what are
the general features we have seen
that cardia hypotension oliguria
cool and calming skin and rapid and
shallow breathing and excessive sweating
so what is the first sign is
hypertension
next question normal pcwp value is
okay i have already discussed this
question normal range is
from 6 to 12 mmhg
so let's come option wise first option
is 12 to 30
mm hgg next 8 to 12 mm hgg
4 to 9 10 to 20 so most appropriate
answer here is
j2 development hd okay what is the next
question
which of the following is common in all
the types of shock
hypertension hypotension bradycardia and
vasoconstriction
i have already discussed this
hypertension is the most common
in all the types of shock okay it is the
first design and it is the most
common to all the types of shock okay
and most common cause of death in septic
septic shock is also
hypotension next question
plasma expanders are used in septic
shock neurogenic shock nf electric shock
and traumatic shock
answer is septic shock okay in septic
shock what is the treatment
we'll discuss in detail so first line is
aggressive expansion of
fluids and second line is anatropic
drugs
we can give plasma expanders activated
protein c
uh antibiotics and surgical development
uh to control the infection
so next is neurogenic shock uh what is
the treatment we can give excessive
volumes of fluid
and also epinephrine norepinephrine or
phenyleptin can also be given
an anaphylactic shock iv epinephrine
let's say
iv anti-instruments are subcutaneous
ignition
an administration of oxygen must be done
in chromatic shock
depending on the cause if there is
severe blood loss we have to administer
fluids okay next coming to
most common parental fluid used in the
hypovolemic shock
selling dextrose lingus lactate and
plasma albumin
let's discuss option wise first is
isotronic saline
it is used in 0.9 percent concentration
it has high concentrations of sodium and
chloride
it is given in a dehydration vomiting
gastric or deodorant aspiration
situations okay
next dextrose it is given in five
percent the and it
is given hypoglycemic condition okay
next is singles lactate
it is also called as hartmann solution
it contains
and sodium potassium chlorine in the
concentrations
similar to that of plasma okay it is a
based on ideal treatment for hypovolemic
shock fluid
replacement is the most important step
in management of hypermile mixture okay
a non-sugar non-protein crystalline
solution with a high
a concentration of sodium approximately
that
of plasma is prepare for preferable in
the initial stage of fluid replacement
so that solution can be ringer selected
it is also called as lingus acetate or
hatman solution
and it is supplemented with one or two
ampoules of sodium
bicarbonate okay resuscitation should
always be started with
such crystalline solution even if the
blood is available
if resuscitation is started with a
acidotic cold
blood block with a high concentration of
potassium potassium concentrations
efficiency of myocardium is tremendously
geopodest so ringers lactate is the best
and ideal solution for treating
hypovolemic shock
next is plasma albumin it is given in
4.5
percentages and it is given in severe
burns patient
okay clear
so that's it thank you and we'll have a
quick
recap on shocked okay what is shock it
is a path of physical condition and life
threatening
condition uh mortality rate is 20
percent pathophysiology
due to inadequate blood supply in an
equator nutrient supply
leads to inadequate removal of cellular
waste products leads to
disruption of vital organs functions
this leads to death
finally types of shock hypovolemic
cardiogenic
septic anaphylactic neurogenic dramatic
okay
next we have seen the stages of shock
and
clinical pieces of shock that is
hypertension tachycardia
and oliguria cold and calm skin
and extremities and rapid and shallow
breathing
excesses weighting and we have seen the
each treatment of each shock it is
hypovolemic shock and its classification
treatment is a administration of fluids
and
vitals must be monitored and
anaphylactic shock
epinephrine and iv antihistamines
cardiogenic shock dopamine is the dog of
choice neurogenic shock
norepinephrine or phenylalanine is a
drug of choice any vasoconstrictor
iso constrictor is safely safely used in
creating neurogenic shock and septic
shock we have seen
firstly and secondly and other plasma
expanders
and antibiotics and surgical department
to control the
infection and next we have seen the
dental considerations
and management in dental offices and
also we have discussed the important
concept that is
pulmonary capillary waste pressure and
it is the best indicator for lead volume
and left
arterial pressure and normal range six
to 12 mm hd
and about square gas catheter also we
have seen and we have also
solved few important questions and yeah
that's it
