communication is a skill that allows you
to share your thoughts and ideas with
others effectively
most of the time your personality traits
such as attitude and confidence are
judged by the way you communicate with
thorough research we have gathered five
tips that can help you improve your
communication abilities
moving forward we will iterate through
them one by one
the first tip on our list is be a master
listener wait you must be thinking what
does listening have to do with
communication well let me tell you
listening is quite essential to build a
rapport with the people you are
interacting with not only that but it
also serves as a means of displaying
respect for others
consider how good it feels when someone
is intently listening to you and is
absolutely intrigued by what you are
saying
don't you feel valued and obligated to
forge ties with that person you do right
so make sure that you don't go on a
monologue while having a chat with
someone
be comfortable and patient under your
skin and try to comprehend all
non-verbal cues
also strive to emphasize key topics or
words from the discourse
this will help you recall the
conversation afterward and will
demonstrate to the speaker that you are
paying attention
the next tip we have is to be aware of
your body language people will take
clues from your body language so be
mindful of how you portray yourself
while speaking with someone in person or
via a virtual call
it's always a good idea to record
yourself and study how others view you
take note of how you stand or sit how
you move your arms and your hands
how your body is oriented and how your
facial expressions are
you can also ask for help from your
friends or family to examine your body
language
after a thorough analysis you can
highlight your blunders and work on them
with plenty of practice you'll be able
to align your body language with your
spoken one the third tip on our list is
to be tactful
being tactful is also an essential
aspect of being a good communicator
people will be even receptive to hear
information they are already familiar
with if it's presented in a diplomatic
matter
a good communicator can predict how
someone would react and adjust their
statements at any instance based on the
listener's reaction but for that to
happen you'll have to understand your
listener take non-verbal cues from his
actions and contemplate a way to
understand his interest
you will also need to manage your
emotional quotient being emotionally
stable might assist you in bringing
clarity of thought to each point you
make in a discussion on that note can

interaction

comes to formal communication
is to be brief and to the point
whether you're talking to a person or
writing a mail to someone make sure to
use simple language and keep your
sentences short and concise being
concise is the finest way of acquiring
clarity

minimum number of words and can also
help others understand your point

the core points you want to convey and
composing a few short and crisp
sentences to describe it
