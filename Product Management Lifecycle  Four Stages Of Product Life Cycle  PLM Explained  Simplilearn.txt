hello everyone and welcome to this video
by simply learn do you remember when the
first iPhone came out in 2007 it was a
game Cher but if you try to use the same
iPhone today you might feel outdated
that's because technology moves fast and
customer demands keep evolving so Tech
giants like apple must keep innovating
and investing heavily in research and
development to stay ahead keeping track
of the entire process from ideon to
product launch is a massive task
especially for companies dealing with
complex manufacturing and global
distribution this is where the product
life cycle management PLM comes in
before product life cycle management
companies had a really tough time
different teams didn't always talk to
each other and it was hard to keep track
of all the information about a product
causing problems like delays and
products that didn't quite hit the mark
saw this and knew they needed a better
way to manage their products from start
to finish so they came up with PLM
strategies that is product life cycle
management strategies and special
computer programs to help everyone work
together better with product life cycle
management everyone involved in making
and selling the product could share
information and work together very
smoothly so this was how Apple keeps
launching new Innovative products like
the latest iPhone or the Apple watch
while phasing out the older models so if
you have ever wondered how companies
like apple keeps delivering such Cutting
Edge Products it's all about managing
the entire life cycle effectively in
this video we will explore what PLM is
that is product life cycle management
the various phases and steps involved
its benefit through a simple
example craving a career upgrade

started let us now understand what is
product life cycle management product
life life cycle management is like the
blueprint that guides companies through
the entire journey of a product from its
birth to its retirement take for
instance the evolution of smartphones in
the development stage companies like
Apple or Samsung spends month designing
and perfecting their new phones deciding
on features like camera quality battery
life and screen size once the design is
locked in they move on to the
introduction stage where the new phone
is launched with much fanfare and
marketing Buzz as people start buying
the new phone it enters into the growth
stage sales Skyrocket and the company
may even release updated versions with a
better features like enhanced cameras or
faster processors to keep up with the
demand and stay ahead of the competition
but eventually every phone reaches to
the maturity stage competitors catch up
and sales starts to level off that's
when companies might offer discounts or
bundle deals to keep customers
interested but inevitably sales begin to
decline as newer models hit the mark and
that's where the PLM shines throughout
the entire process it helps companies to
make critical decisions like when to
release updates how much inventory to
keep and when to discontinue the product
all together by effectively managing the
product life cycle companies can stay
agile maximize profit and always offer
the customers the best products now that
we have discussed what product life
cycle management is we will now
understand the different phases of
product development when it comes to
products we go through a journey from
just being an idea to becoming real
tangible thing that customers can buy
and use this journey is what we call the
product life cycle and it has several
phases let's use the example of a new
smartphone to illustrate these phases it
all starts with the concept and design
phase this is where the magic happens
the initial ideon research on what
customers want studying competitive
products and defining the smartphone
core features and requirements once the
concept is locked in we move on to the
development phase here the details
designs and prototypes are created
tested and refined based on the real
world feedback imagine Engineers
tinkering with different models running
all sorts of validation tests and making
sure the smartphone is ready for the
prime time with all that hard work done
it's time for the production and the
launch phase this is where the final
Market ready version of the smartphone
is produced and rolled out to the stores
and online outlets for customers to get
their hands on it but the journey
doesn't end here after launch comes in
the service and support phase where the
company provides assistance updates and
resources to help customers get the most
out of their new smartphone purchases
eventually even the best product reach
out to the end of their Road that's when
the retirement phase where the company
figures out the best way to phase out an
aging product maybe offer incentives for
upgrades and potentially recycle or
repurpose components for future
Innovations so there you have it the
five key phases that product typically
go through in the product life cycle
management let me walk you through the
stages of product life cycle management
every product goes through different
stages during the lifetime known as the
product life cycle this cycle starts
when the product hits the mark after
development and ends when it's taken off
the shelves or discontinued learning the
product life cycle management can help
improve your chances of success in
product management while it's just a
model and not perfect it provides a
useful approximation to understand the
stages what a product goes through the
four main stages are introduction growth
maturity decline we will now learn about
the different stages in detail so let's
talk about the stage one which is
Introduction in this stage a new product
is launched into the market after
development companies typically spend a
lot on promotional efforts like
advertising and getting the product onto
shelves and in front of the customers
example when Apple launches a new iPhone
model they heavily market and advertise
it across the channel they also work to
get it stocked at mobile carriers and
retail stores worldwide for the release
date this is usually little to no profit
made at the stage as the costs of the
launch are so high the first buyers tend
to be innovators and the early adopters
excited to try the new offering despite
potential issues let us now talk about
the stage two which is the growth stage
in this stage the product moves to the
growth stage where the consumer demands
accelerates the primary objectives are
to rapidly gain as much as market share
share as possible and bring aboard new
customer segments your focus shifts to
aggressive marketing promotions and
added product features and models to
appeal to different customer groups for
example Apple markets the new iPhone to
different audiences like professionals
Gamers photographers Etc they add new
color options and storage capacities to
give buyers more choices retail channels
and online ordering systems have to
handle the huge surge in demand it's
critical to capture as much as market
share as possible in this phase while
optimizing pricing for both growth and
profitability before too many
competitors emerge let us now move on to
stage number three which is the maturity
stage after an initial growth spurred
the product life cycle reaches to its
maturity stage where the market becomes
saturated and sales growth starts
flattening the main goals transition to
maximizing profitability defending
market share and differentiating the
product from increasing competition
companies May introduce product
variations and new models while
leveraging lower prices promotions and
revamped marketing we can say for
example Apple continues releasing
updated iPhone models like 11 12 13 Etc
every year with adding new designs
features like better camera and prices
spanning different segments older models
get discounted marketing emphasize what
differentiates them from the latest
Android rals as a product manager your
focus is on continuously improving
production and operational efficiency to
cut cost and maximize profit during this
extended maturity stage of the product
line we will not talk about the stage
four which is the decline eventually
even the most successful products enter
an inevitable decline stage as the
market become saturated and Innovations
start making the product obsolete or you
can say unappealing companies may try to
Res segment the market with new models
or versions promote different usage
occasions cut prices dramatically to
flush out remaining inventory or
ultimately discontinue the product for
example Apple could release an ultra
affordable iPhone for emerging markets
or focus on just score basic functions
or they could use transition customers
to a new generation of foldable AR en
devices once smartphone sales bottoms
out as a product manager Your Role is to
determine if anything can be done to
breathe out new life into the product
line or just oversee the cost effective
wind down and transition customers to
replacement offerings for product
managers understanding and planning for
each product life cycle stage is very
important to make the product a big
success we have now discussed all the
details let us now delve into how this
tracking is achieved by measuring
product life cycles companies must make
more than just the same products forever
they must continually innovate and
launch new offerings but how do they
know when it's time to move on to
something new the answer lies in
carefully measuring and tracking key
performance indicators which is kpis
across the product life cycle here are
some of the crucial metrics companies
use in the development stage the main
work is on prioritizing user problems
and building viable Solutions key
metrics here are ontime delivery and
team velocity during the launch phase
your goal is to achieve product Market
fit user engagement conversion rates
feature adoption net promoter score NPS
and customer satisfaction score we can
say csat are crucial metrics to measure
product Market fit you can also use
methods like the scen ls survey cohort
retention rate NPS over 30 or the 30%
referral method now in the growth phase
your focus is on gaining market share
through the product differentiation and
growth experiments track user engagement
NPS referral rates customer acquisition
rates market share and even churn rate
in the maturity phase aim to retain
customers by creating product
distinctions and reducing cost monitor
arpu retention rates new feature
development and adoption rates of new
features finally in the decline phase
you can either pivot to find new areas
for growth or gracefully Sunset the
product track burn rates monthly
recurring revenue and annual recurring
Revenue remember qualitative data is
also important throughout these phases
to understand use experiences and
sentiments so that was all for measuring
product life cycle let us not talk about
the future of the product life cycle
management product life cycle management
isn't just a passing trend it's the
future of how companies will manage
their products with rapid advancements
in technology and shifting consumer
preferences PLM is poised to undergo
significant change with new technologies
like AI better teamwork tools companies
can crunch data and collaborate better
making products faster and smarter than
ever before plus there's the big focus
on being eco-friendly product life cycle
management is the key to making sure
everything from design to disposal is
green as possible for furthermore AS
Global connectivity increases PLM system
will also become more interconnected
allowing for seamless collaboration
between teams regardless of their
location real-time data sharing and
Analysis will enable agile decision
making ensuring companies stay ahead of
the curve in today's fast-paced market
