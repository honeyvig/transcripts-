now without further delay let's get
started so now we are on the Excel sheet
and you can see that in this particular
Excel sheet we have some student details
we have the serial numbers names role
numbers class blood group and some
subjects like math science computer
statistics social GK and the final marks
obtained percentage and total marks
right so let us imagine that uh a
company has come for an interview so all
these students are going to attend an
interview and uh the minimum percentage
to attend the interview will be like
75% so you can see that we have 75 here
and all the students have got above 75
except for the one student which is Mike
right so for Mike to attend the
interview he needs 75 percentage or
above so uh he can make some
modifications in one of these subjects
right so there is always an exam after
the exam called as Improvement exam so
if you can like to score some extra
marks in the subjects which you have
scored less so that you can make up to
the percentage what you're expecting you
can do that so here in this particular
sheet uh Mike has six subjects right and
in six subjects you can see he has codes
of in 6 91 45 71 94 and 62 so out of
these he have scored Less in one subject
compared to all the subjects one subject
is really low that is computers so what
if he can give an improvement exam and
increase his percentage to 75 right so
that can be done so we can do some root
Force methods like we can change the
marks like 55 and then check this
particular one so it's getting 74 right
so using the brute force method will be
a little bit lengthy so you can do this
because it is just a small uh table
which has least number of data and you
just have one single cell to modify so
that can be done in small tables but
what if you had some table with hundreds
of rows or thousands of rows that'll be
time consuming right so for that we have
some inbuilt functionality in Excel that
is called goal seek in Excel so now
let's eliminate the marks
here so we have eliminated the marks and
the upgraded percentage is 65 now we
need the target as
75 okay so let's uh write it
as Mike's Target right we need mic so
Mike's new Target
as 75
[Music]
okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75
percentage we will use the data
operation so here on the toolbar which
has file home insert Etc we have one
other option called as data so when you
click on data from toolbar you'll have
this ribbon and in this ribbon we have
various options so when you come into
forecast group we have an option called
what if analysis when you click on vtif
analysis you'll have a set of options
out of which we have goal seek now for
goalseek we need to select a table cell
that is this particular table cell that
is
M9 so we need the value 75 here right so
what is the cell that you need to change
here for that you need to select this
one and select this particular cell here
right and now you can select okay now
you can see that Excel has automatically
run all the permutations and
combinations and has come up with a
number so that the overall percentage of
mic will be 75% right so the expected
marks that Mike should be getting in his
computer's Improvement exam should be
equal to 56 or greater than 56 to get
the final Target as 75 so that he can
attend the company's interview so this
is how we use goal set or goal seek in
Excel now let's quickly get onto the
Practical mode where we will have some
data sets over which we will be trying
to apply the charts now there are
various types of charts in table and
those are the pie chart the column chart
the bar chart column versus line pavier
chart and Spark line charts so we will
discuss one after the other first let us
discuss about the pie chart so as you
you can see we have a small data set on
my screen which I have personally
created and uh this deals with the
companies and this deals with the shares
of the automobile industry so now for
this let's create a pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we're going to use the insert
option and when you select the insert
option you will have a ribbon here and
inside the ribbon you can see groups
tables illustrations addin and here you
go these are the charts so now we needed
a pie chart so select on that icon and
you have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the three-dimensional pie chart as
it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format at data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be uh a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right
yeah and there is another option where
you can directly explode this like you
can pick it out you can see this right
Point explosion where you can split it
out and you can show that especially
like you can highlight it and show it so
that's the you know a great way of
presenting your data so that's how you
can work with pie charts in Excel now
let's quickly move to the next one that
is the column chart and in the column
chart we have the data related to some
company and uh the profits of that
company based on a so you can see that
the year has started from 2008 and it
has gone until 2021 and these are the
profits of that company year after year
so since we are dealing with column
chart I'll tell you the simplest way to
create a column chart there is a
shortcut key for that which is alt F1
and there you go you have the chart
right on your
screen
now you can uh expand the chart just by
dragging it like that and you can see
that there is some problem with this
chart that is we have numbers here
instead of ear right you can see that
the First Column is the ear which is
2008 to 2021 but here you can see we
have 1 2 3 4 which is not proper right
so to change the axis that is you can
see the axis which is 1 2 3 4 from 1 2 3
4 to the ears 2008 2009 2010 11 Etc you
just have to make one change here and
also you can see I have pressed the plus
icon over here which will open the
option where you can include the access
titles if you have and data labels
everything right so for now I think I'll
keep it as it is so you can include the
data table as well as it is here and you
can include that in the chart there are
various options that Excel provides you
so now let's uh focus on changing the
axis from 1 2 3 4 to the ears for that
you need to select the chart design and
inside the chart design you have an
option called select data press that and
here you have various set of options you
can see profits you can see ears now
we'll select ears and we will remove
that and now you can see the edit option
here right select that and now it will
ask you which column to be selected for
the access ring
for that let's select this and now let's
select the ears
here and press okay and there you go
again press okay so there you go you
have the ears over here instead of the
numbers which you had in the first place
so that's how you create the column
chart and we have the next type of chart
which is really simple now you know you
kind of change this chart directly into
bar chart there is no big deal in that
so uh for that you just need to select
the change chart type option over here
you're just changing the chart type and
you can get the bar graph over here
column and bar graphs are completely
same to each other only that you can see
these uh bars in the horizontal way
rather than in the vertical way let's do
that let's not create a new thing for
that so uh yeah there you go when you
select the change chart type option you
have various set of chart type options
on the menu bar over here so what we
needed was the bar chart now let's
select that and there you go let's
select okay and you have the bar
chart right and you if you want you can
include the data labels which look a
little bit more interesting you can also
include the data table as
well okay for now I think we have to
expand the chart to get the Clear
View yeah that's how you do it
right now let's move into the next type
of one yeah we dealt with the bar chart
so we'll directly enter into the column
versus line chart so we have similar
kind of data we just had year and
profits in the previous part now we also
have included the expenses right we
needed another column to showcase the
line chart compared to the columns right
so for that I've included a new column
that is expenses as well now just let's
select the
data and let's select the option alt F1
to create our
chart right now automatically uh Excel
has provided us the column chat we have
The Columns of expenses we have the
column of profits and we also have ear
now let's change the data as we did
before select uh here and remove it and
then edit
select edit and select the ear that is
from here to
2021 select okay and we have the ears
over here now what we needed to do is
change the chart type right select the
change chart type option and since we
wanted to create a column versus line
chart it is a combination whenever you
want one or two types of charts included
in one single chart window then it has a
combo option so here we need to select
the combo option and inside that we have
various types of combination charts we
have clustered column we have clustered
line on secondary axis we have clustered
stat area clustered colum and the other
one is custom combination so let's go
with the first one that is clustered
line let's select that and there you go
we have the line graph with the column
so that's how we create the column
versus line and and if you want you can
include the data labels and you can
include the data table as well yeah okay
I think uh we need to expand the canvas
a little more to get a clear
view
yeah so you have Legends over here you
have the data labels and access
everything and chart title you can
always change the chart title so for now
let's uh rename it as Pro profits versus
expenses yeah that's that's how it
goes done okay I think I made a spelling
mistake
here yeah it's clear
now now the next type of chart we're
going to deal with is the P
chart so uh we have dealt with P chart
column chart bar chart and column versus
line now P chart is a little bit
different it's like you're going to
create some active chart which responds
to the variations you're making to your
data so to understand that better let's
create a practical chart over here I
select all the
data
okay yeah I have selected the data now
to create a pivot
chart let's
select the insert option from the
toolbar and inside the ribbon we have
charts group and inside that we have PIV
chart now let's select the P chat option
and there you go now it's asking for
range and we have selected the range
over there and uh we are not going to
create a new worksheet for the entire
chart we are going to create the uh
chart inside the existing worksheet
itself so for that let's select the uh
area where we want to select the uh
chart to be present now for that let's
select this
and yeah select
okay okay there is some
error let's cancel this and try
again let's select the
data and preview chart again
we have selected the
range
yeah that's how you select the range and
now select the position where you want
to create it existing worksheet we have
selected that and press okay yeah that's
that's the way we've got our P chart
over here and you can see our P chart is
completely blank right now it will
respond to the changes you make to your
P chat for now we have uh serial numbers
and uh these are the names of the guys
who
have okay so these are the names of the
guys you who have some dealerships for
various car makes such as Ford Ferrari
Honda Kia Alpha Romeo BMW etc etc so uh
we're going to change or we're going to
see um you know we're going to make some
charts of the persons who own the cars
or the car brands or dealerships in
various regions so we're going to work
on that now let's drag in the
name and uh let's drag
region and
cards and the
units yep
so we have our uh chart over here column
chart which has the different different
names and the dealerships and some of
cars over there right so you can see
that we can also change some values over
here what if we wanted to know only uh
the details regarding Jennifer you can
do that you can unselect everything and
you can just select Jennifer and press
okay now you'll have the details of only
Jennifer of having the car brands so we
have the regions as well so Jennifer
owns dealerships in two different
regions that is South and West and uh
the sum of units and count of cars as
well so that's how the PV charts are
used in real
time and now let's select sales and drag
the sales as
well yeah it's been dragged and you have
the sales of U
Jenifer the details of her sales and
let's move the chart a little bit and
you have the plus icon where you can
include the data labels for a better
information yeah so that's how you use
the P charts so we are on the last type
of charts which is the spark line chart
Now to create a spark line chart we need
to get into the insert option and inside
we have the ribbon and inside the ribbon
we have the group that is spark lines
now to generate a spark line chart we
need to select this particular column
and then select the type of spark line
you want to create for now let's create
the column type of spark line chart yep
we have to Club these cells together
first we for got that because we're
going to insert the spark line chart
right above here now for that let's
merge the
cells
[Music]
yeah so uh we wanted to create the
spark line chart of column type and now
it's asking for the location where we
want to create the spark line chart so
this is the location now let's select
okay and there you go we have the spark
line chart right over here now you can
see that we have a negative Point here
so if you want you can change that from
negative to positive and it will
automatically update that and if you
want to add the axis ACC to this
particular chart you can select the
options Park line and there you go you
have certain options like High Point low
point and if you wanted to add some
margin you can also do
that add data type access and there you
have the
access show access yeah you have the
access now and you can have the high
point and low point for that as well
which is the you know the biggest change
and the smallest change in this
particular segment that is few Furniture
yeah Furniture had the highest sales in
January and uh Home Appliance had the
lowest sale and you can also change the
color and uh let's type of change the
color again yeah we have a different
color over here which resembles a little
bit more better or you can also go with
this one and if you wanted to add the
same to all all these tables you can do
that just by dragging it and you have it
for all the 6
months now if you wanted to add some new
data in this row or you wanted to add a
new complete row then you can do that as
well and change that and bring that
change implemented in these charts as
well now let us try to add a new row
here which includes the miscellaneous we
have that data right over here let's
select that copy and uh let's let's
paste it over here so there you go we
have the extra row here so yeah now we
have added the miscellaneous row and
right now we have the spark line chart
for only four columns or four rows that
is Furniture technology home appliances
and office needs and miscellaneous is
missing now to add that as well let's
select spark line and inside spark line
just select edit Group location and data
and now let's select the entire data
and now select
okay there's something wrong
again spark line edit
data select
range this should be helping yeah there
you go we have all the fire rows now
including Furniture technology home
appliances office needs and
miscellaneous so conditional formatting
is a method to visualize your worksheet
we already have the charts in Excel to
visualize our Excel sheets in graphical
form but what if you had to see or
visualize the data in your worksheet as
it is so that is where the conditional
formatting comes handy now let's get
back to the Microsoft Excel and try to
implement some conditional formatting
now we are on on the Excel worksheet
this particular data set is based on a
store now we have various columns in
this particular data set we have R ID
order ID customer name Etc and finally
we have quantity discount and profits
now let's go to profits uh let us
imagine that we have provided this
particular store with a target of
minimum 15% profits now let us find out
the stores that have hit the 15% Target
and the ones which did not
so for that let us select the entire
column now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home toolbar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the condition formatting
option click on that and you have
various options over here highlighting
the cells top bottom rules data bars
data scales and icons so data bars are
actually the bar graphs which highlight
themselves on each and every cell if you
implement them and these are the color
scales if you want to implement some
colors you can go through that and if
you want to represent your CS with icons
you can also do that for now let's
highlight the sales so select that and
inside this select the greater than
option and here you can provide the
percentage that is
15% and the sales or the stores which
hit the target should be highlighted
with green color and select okay and
there you go you have your stores that
hit the 15 15% Target and the ones which
did not hit the 15% Target now if we
want to highlight the ones which did not
hit the 15% Target you can highlight
them with the color
red
so conditional formatting highlight the
Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use this column
and conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the
icons now we have the icons over here
the X indicates that they're not alive
and the Green Tech Mark indicates that
they're alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in
Excel so what is data validation in
Excel so it is a feature by Microsoft
Excel where it can restrict data entry
into certain cells by using data
validation and it will prompt the users
to enter valid data in the cells based
on the rules and restrictions provided
by the creator of that particular sheet
now this would be a little confusing to
understand so to understand it in a much
better way let's get back to the
practical way where we will start
entering some data validation rules to
our Excel sheet and try to enter data
into it
now we are on the Microsoft Excel and
this particular sheet is based on
employee ID employee name employee
Department employee salary fiscal year
and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we
will enter rules based on the emplo ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering employee ID it would be
a whole number so let us select whole
number option and now here you can see
the option of between not equal to equal
to not between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and
11,000
now select okay and now the new rule has
been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employ ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one there you go you can see that
Microsoft Excel is not allowing you to
include a wrong number it says this
value does not match the data validation
restrictions defined for this cell so
now you can press retry and try to enter
some number which is in between 10,000
to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of the I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you are the
person who's trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter
EMP
ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please
enter
data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid data
1
9
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the employee name where we have
to provide
uh the second type that is text length
now let us imagine that uh in your
company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or uh 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 50
and press okay okay minimum will change
it to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character
data please enter valid name
and error
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than
50 press okay
now let us try to enter a random name
okay uh we'll enter characters more than
15 here qu t
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters yeah now we have entered more
than 15 characters and it is showing
please enter characters less than 15 so
now we can ret right and try to enter
some valid
name
um now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another
name
I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary physic
clear and work timings after that we'll
learn about uh the list
one now let's come into employee salary
so salary is something where you have to
include decimal points so now let us go
to uh data validation and inside the
values we have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll uh deal with
employee salary that is decimal now
minimum is okay what is uh minimum can
be one
0 and the maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just then
enter
valid salary
okay now let's change it to minimum is
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between
10,000 to 10 lakhs
let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please
enter between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and
data validation conditions are applied
to this column now let us try to enter
some invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide 20
,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscally Year
let us imagine that we wanted to you
know work on the employees for current
working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that you need
to select the entire column go to data
validation settings and inside here you
have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/ 01/
2021 and end date is
01/01
SL
2022 and input
message let us provide data as current
fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be S inv
valid
dat select okay now the error message
and uh the data input message and the
data validation rule has been applied
for this column so let's try to enter
some date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20 22 it will not take this it will
throw error
so that's how it works now let us try to
enter as
2021 and this is
March it will take it now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
balance for all your employees so you
just want them to work between 9 to 5
and that should be fine and anything
apart from that time should be invalid
so you can do that by selecting uh time
option between it should be in between
and the start time will be
09 0 0 and this should be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 900
a.m.
to okay
5
pm. this should be the input
message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here
you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be a log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us
provide the login time this should be
the right time
and uh let's try to provide wrong
timings 08 now it will not take it it
will throw as error so it's working fine
let us provide 10 now let us provide the
log out time it should be below 5 p.m so
let us provide five it will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
1 minute less than
five that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well
05 0 0 0
0 okay still there is some
problem okay we have entered four we
should we are supposed to enter 24hour
timing right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team so what you can do is you can
provide a list so using that list you
can just uh H over to that cell select
the drop- down menu and inside that you
can select the option so we will try to
work something like that if we have
selected the entire
column selection
okay yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some sales without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales yes
now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message select
one
select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from drop
down
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop- down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option option so
you can select developer for first one
and for second one you can select uh
tester right okay this is good for uh
one or two options maybe three or even
maybe like five but what if you have
more departments okay let's go to this
uh second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
see your second is developer tester
quality analyst system analyst Finance
human resource so so many options are
there so you cannot keep on typing all
of them right so here it is 15 what if
you have like 25 like 50 departments
right it will be tough so for this you
have another option so let me select all
this data and copy this from this sheet
to our employee
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here let's expand
this
okay now we have our uh list over here
now let us remove the data validation
from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
erase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to
list now here we can select the source
SCE select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select one from the menu or the
dropdown
copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry
yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided
options you can scroll down and select
any one of of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system
analyist and and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this okay so we have deleted
systems analist and when you click on
the options here you don't have systems
analyist in that place you have blank
space right so there is a way where all
your uh you know data can be messed up
so to avoid this what you can do is you
can actually um save this data in a
different sheet like I did here like
Department data you can hide this sheet
or you can protect the sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up so now let us get back to
the employ data and select this column
and uh clear everything press okay and
let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah
everything okay now we have basically
removed this data from here now let us
try to apply the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's
provide input
message
data
options M Department
options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide
CEO then we have have
developer then we
have
test so that's how you can protect your
sheets as well what is Excel
vlookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different colum but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly def
find data associated with the value the
user enters now let's look at the syntax
to write a vlookup function so vlookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the v of
function so the first argument is called
the look of value the look of value
represents the value that you're are
searching for next is the table array
the table array represents two or more
Columns of information the Third arent
is called the column index number now
this represents the column number in the
table from which the value must be
returned the First Column is one the
second column is two and so on and then
we have the fourth parameter which is
called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you need to
enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to no
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo so for our demonstration we'll use
a sales data set you can see the data
set on the left using this data set
we'll understand how we lookup performs
an exact and approximate match we'll see
how V lookup is case insense sensitive
then we'll perform a wild card character
search we'll understand how to handle
errors when a match is not found and
finally you will look at two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how V lookup works so we want to find
the units sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left so here you can see I
have the data set it has some rows and
columns so these are the columns which
are order date region there's a
representative column item units there's
unit cost and total and from this table
I want to find the units that were sold
by Morgan if you look at the table at
the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan and Morgan
has sold 30 units now I want to find
this value using the V lookup function
so here on the right you can see I have
my lookup value which is Morgan and this
is my V lookup formula
and using this formula I'm getting the
result as 30 now let's go to our Excel
workbook and perform all the demos one
by one so this is my Excel workbook that
we are going to use for our demo and
here is the data set we'll be using now
this is the same data set that you saw a
while ago so this data set has seven
columns you have the order date the
region Representatives name item there
units unit cost and total which is is
basically the total or the amount of
sales that was
generated we are going to use a chunk of
this data set and perform our vlookup
analysis so let's see our first example
and the problem we have at hand let me
go to the exact match tab all right so
here I'm going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first 11 rows from the data set you can
see from row
two till row 12 is going to be our data
set that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thompson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that he sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my vooka function so let's go
ahead and write our vooka
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my V lookup formula to write the
vup formula I'll write first equal to
and I'll write vook up if I hit tab it
will auto complete all right now let's
give the parameters so first is going to
be the lookup value which is nothing but
Thompson so I'll just select this cell
which is
j17 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the first column of a table and you can
select the table array till the end of
the data set or till the column which
has the value want to find so here I'll
select my table array starting from the
representatives column till the end of
the item column which is going to be my
table array then I'll select the column
index number so the column index number
is based on the table array you have
selected in this case my column index
number is going to be two because we
have selected just two columns and the
value which I'm going to find is in the
second column so I'll give two comma Now
the range lookup I'm going to give is
false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson had sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil all right now let's try
to change the table array and see what
result are we getting so this time I'll
slightly change the table array so again
we are trying to find the item that
Thompson had sold so I'll write my
formula equal to V lookup I'll hit tab
to autoc complete I'll give my lookup
value as Thompson comma this time I'm
choosing my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the data set which is till p12 again
my column index number is going to be
two because if you consider this table
as the item column is the second column
in the selected table array so I'm going
to write it as two comma the range
lookup I want to give as false because I
want to find the exact match if I close
this and hit enter you can see it has
return returned me the same result that
we saw earlier now suppose let's say
this time I want to start my table array
from the region colum which is this
column so I want to select my table
array starting from the region column
now the this is going to show me an
error because your table array should
always start from the look of value
column so if you consider Thompson as
the look of value my table array should
always start from the representatives
column so let's just try this example so
I'll write V lookup my lookup value I'm
going to give it as Thomson comma the
table array as I mentioned earlier I'm
going to choose from the region column
and let's say I'll select till the item
column give another another comma and
this time my column index number is
going to be three because since the
table array has three columns and my
item column is the last column so I'm
going to give my column index number is
three comma I want to get the exact
match so I give zero if I close the
bracket and hit enter you can see it has
given me an
error okay now let me just show you
another method to use V lookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under function Library you see we have
an option to select look up and
reference if I click on this and if I
scroll down below you can see there's an
option called vlookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range
lookup under this function arguments
dialog box
so here I want to select my lookup value
as Thomson my table array is going to be
from the representatives column till
let's say the end of the data set my
column index number is going to be
two I'll write two and range lookup I'll
write as false because I want the exact
match now if I hit okay you can see it
has given us the exact same result so
this is one of the other ways to use V
lookup in Excel now let's move to the
next sheet which is regarding
approximate match okay so sometimes you
might have cases where you don't have
the lookup value present in the table in
those cases you can tell V lookup to
return an approximate match now one
thing to keep in mind is that your
lookup value column should always be
sorted in ascending order while trying
to get an approximate match so here we
are going to use this table and my
lookup value column which which is going
to be the representatives column is
already sorted in ascending
order and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be Matt now if you see
this table I don't have the
representatives name mat anywhere in the
table now using an approximate match I
want to find the item and the unit cost
so let's do it so here under item I'll
write my vlookup formula so I'll type
vlookup I'll hit tab to complete it and
this time my look of value is going to
be Matt so I'll select this cell comma
my table array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
item column because I want to find the
item value for Matt I'll give a comma my
column index number as per the table
array is going to be two comma my range
lookup this time I'm going to give us
true or one so I'll write one close the
bracket hit enter all right it has
written me binder was the item sold by
Matt now let's try to figure out why we
look up returned binder as the
item now let's say you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Q so in an approximate match
we lookup will consider the previous
highest value in this case the previous
highest value before Matt is KL and
hence we look up returned the
corresponding item purchased by Kel
which is binder now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for mat
again we lookup will return the unit
cost of KL which is
125 let's just try out so I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is mat comma my
table array for this time is going to be
from Representatives column till the
unit cost column I'll consider I'll give
a comma Now the colum index number as
per the table array is going to be four
we give another comma and this time I'll
double click true because I want an
approximate match if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see it has returned me
125 which is actually kl's unit cost
okay we have another question and this
time I want to find the units sold by
Rob now Rob is going to be my lookup
value if you see the representatives
column we don't have Rob now let's see
what we look up is going to return and
as the item for Rob so I'll write V
lookup I'll give my lookup value as Rob
comma my table array is going to start
from the representatives column I'll
select till here I'll give a comma the
column index number is two give another
comma I'll double click on
true I close the bracket hit enter you
can see V lookup has return return me
pen now let's understand why vlookup
returned pen for Rob now if you are
asked to insert the representatives name
Rob into this column so ideally Rob
would appear somewhere between Morgan
and sorino
because since this is sorted in
ascending order Rob is actually greater
than Morgan and is less than sorino so
as you know we look up in an approximate
match Returns the previous highest value
which is Morgan here and the
corresponding item for Morgan is pen and
hence we look up returned pen for Rob
all right now moving to the next
sheet which is another property of
vlookup which tells V lookup always
looks to the right this means that your
lookup value must always be on the left
and the value you are going to find out
should always be to the right of the
table now consider this scenario where
your lookup value is on the left in this
case it is the representatives value
and I have taken svino for an example
and we want to find the order date for
svino now if you consider this table
your lookup value which is svino is
actually this column the representatives
column and we are going to find out the
order date so your representatives name
is on the right of the table and the
value we are going to find out is on the
left of the table now as for the
property we look up only looks to the
right so so if I use the vlookup
function for this example here I'll
write vlookup I'll give my lookup value
as s Vino comma my table array I'll
consider from the order date because I
want the order date
till the representatives column I'll
give a comma and this time my column
index number is actually the first
column if I consider my table array as
the first three columns selected
and my range lookup is going to be false
if I close the bracket hit enter it
returns me an error the reason is we
look up always looks to the right and
this time the value we were trying to
find out was to the left of the
table now if you consider the opposite
case suppose you have the order date and
you want to find the representatives
name you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your Representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write V lookup my lookup value
is going to be S Vino's order date so
I'll select it from the table I'll give
a comma my table array will start from
the G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number will be three if you consider
these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got svino corresponding to the order
date all right now let's move to the
next
tab now this tab says V lookup returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by Jardine if you see
this table we have the representatives
name Jardin twice you see here and if
you look down we have jardan here as
well but the item sold by jardan at the
first instance is pencil and at the
second instance it's desk now as per the
property V lookup always returns the
first match now ideally when we write
the V lookup function and look for the
units sold by Jardine you will see vup
will return 36 instead of three let's
just write
out I'll write the V of
function my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the table
array is three I'll give another comma
Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter now as you can see it returns me
the first first match of Jardine which
is 36 so we lookup did not consider the
second
match
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here you have Jones here for the
second time and also we have Jones for
the third time and let's say you want to
find the unit cost for Jones so if I
write the vooka
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range lookup is zero if I
click on this and hit enter you can see
it here V lookup has returned the first
instance of Jones and it did not come
consider the second and the third
instance so our unit cost for Jones is
1.99 because we look up only Returns the
first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is we lookup is
case
insensitive if you consider this table
I've added another row in green so if
you see here I have a representative
name called Gil which is in proper case
or popularly known as sentence Keys here
I have added Gil's name
in capital letters are all in upper case
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is Gil which is
actually in upper case I'll consider my
table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the sales
column based on this selection my column
index number is
five comma the range lookup is false so
I'll just double click on
false if I close the bracket hit enter
you can see it here our vook of function
has returned the total as
53973 which is actually the value for
this row so clearly V up did not
consider Gil was present at the bottom
of the table in upper case so this shows
that V lookup is clearly case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the vuca function supports
wild cards which makes it possible to
perform a partial match on a lookup
value for instance you can use V lookup
to retrieve values from a table after
typing only part of a lookup value to
use wild cards with vlookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for for the last argument that
is range lookup now we have a question
here I want to know how much sales did
the representative whose name starts
with Ki make now here sales represents
the total column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if you consider the representative
column I have one representative whose
name starts with Ki that is Kel so
using Ki as my lookup value I want to
find the total so let me show you how to
use wildcard characters and find the
value using vlookup so I'll write my
function V
lookup okay now in lookup value I'll
give
Ki after that I'm going to write Amber
scent followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star
and close the inverted comma this means
the value starts with Ki Amber sent
actually represents concatenation and
star represents anything followed by Ki
so this is going to be my lookup value
in total I'll give a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of total column because I
want to find the seals I'll give another
comma
my column index number based on the
table array we have selected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
999.50 which is actually equals
total now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I I can
directly write it in the vooka function
so I'll write the vooka function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value So within double
inverted commas I'm writing Ki followed
by Amber sent which is for concatenation
followed by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my look of values
this in total means anything that
appears after Ki will be considered as
the look of
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number would be five comma
the range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you see we have the
same value so this is another method or
another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the vlookup function cannot find a match
it returns a hash na error now if you
want you can use the if na function to
replace the has na error with a friendly
message so suppose you want to find the
region in which an order was placed on
10th of May
2018 now if the order date is not found
I want to return a message that is
invalid date so
if you look at the order date column we
don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my V lookup function cannot
find this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write
this I'll type my vook of function I'll
give my order date as 10th of May 2015
as my lookup value and then I'll
consider my table array starting from
the order date column till the end of
region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table are we have selected
comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do it I'll do it here so to
return a valid
message I'll use the ifna function and
within ifna function I'll give my V
lookup function so let me type if
na I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my vup function so my lookup value is
going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes since it is a
text
message I close the bracket hit and
enter you can see the result which is
invalid
date now moving on to the final section
of the demo we have two-way
lookup now in the v lookup function the
column index parameter is normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using the match function to locate
the right
column and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and
columns now let me first show you how a
match function works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my math match type as zero for
exact match if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me four because my
array was selected from the
representatives column till the unit
cost column and in this array unit cost
is at the fourth
index all right now using this idea
let's solve the following problem I want
to find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan so let's write our vooka formula
right be
lookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the representatives name as Morgan comma
my table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit cost
comma my lookup array is from C1 till
fub1 comma my match type is zero I close
this bracket give another comma and I'll
give my range lookup as zero close the
bracket hit enter you can see for Morgan
the unit cost is 19.99 you can verify
from from the table for Morgan the unit
cost is
19.99 all right now we have another
question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrew make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here okay so let me just paste the table
here all right now I'll create another
column where I'll merge the values of
region and representatives so here let
me create another column okay I'll just
name this column as
region
rep all right now this column
I'll use the concatenation operator so
I'll Select East use Amber Cent and then
select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the total I'll write
my vlookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
j11
erson
k11 comma while table array will start
from the region rep which has the values
of region and rep combined
till the last
column and from this table array my
column index number is five and my range
lookup is zero if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see for central region
which is this one and for Andrew's
representative the total is
14925 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did in this demo okay so first of
all we saw our data set which was a
sales data set that we used then we
started with our first example to see
how vooka performs an exact match we
also saw how using the formulas Tab and
lookup and reference you
can write V lookup in another way so you
can use the function arguments to give
your V lookup parameters next we saw how
V lookup performs an approximate match
so we had Matt and raw which were not
present in the representatives column
after that we saw an important property
of V lookup that is V lookup only looks
to the right followed by V lookup only
Returns the first match following which
we saw that V lookup is case insensitive
so here we had added a new row where Gil
was present in upper case but still we
look up found the total revenue for Gil
which was in sentence case or proper
case next we saw how we can use Wild
Card characters to use V
lookups and here we saw how to use an if
any a function along with V lookup and
finally we saw how to use two V lookups

simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are on
the sheet of Microsoft Excel and here
you can see some data on my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop- down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that
equals to H
lookup now the first one is the lookup
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of cherry reflecting here
now similarly let's find out the salary
of all the employees using H lookup so
equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name of the employee now the
table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third R in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try try to find out Peter's employee ID
and salary so there you go one5 and
50,000 as salary so that's how you use H
lookup in Excel here you can see the
first chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee ID Department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salary
now coming to the new data table and
here on the table two which is an
updated table here you can find we're
going to find out the department of the
employee and the current Department of
employee and the bonus percentage based
on his or her salary so why are we
finding current Department again so here
you can see that we have an intern Emily
who has joined in the year 2020 but
recently she got promoted as a developer
so her department has been changed from
Department in turn to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we're
going to find out here in the current
Department using X lookup now let's
start to implement X lookup so for that
equals to X lookup and for lookup you
can see if you need to find out the
lookup value lookup array return array
and all the other two are not important
right now but you can use them to get
some exact matches in the future we'll
also use that in the future for now
let's try to use the first three
parameters that is look up value look up
at array and written array so the lookup
value is the name of the employee Mary
and lookup array is right here which is
this one now we are going to select the
lookup array then comma and uh we're
going to look up the department so this
is the department lookup
array and that's all we
need close the bracket and press enter
okay I think we missed out the lookup
value so the employee uh or the lookup
value which we required was missed so
I've added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go press enter and you have
the department here now let's add it to
all the rowes and here you have all the
rowes and all the data related to all
the employees now we will find out the
current Department as you can see here
you have em as intern which is the old
data but what if you needed the latest
data that is the developer in the year
2021 right for that you might want to to
the X lookup formula a little bit so
let's try that X look up look up value
which is the same and comma Now where
you have to look for the array that is
lookup array this one and the return
array which happens to be this
one and
next
you can find the exact match for this
one so that's all right exact match and
here comes the important part where you
have to search last to first by default
X lookup searches for first to last that
is like this in the starting place to
the last place so that's the reason why
we had Emily as intern so now if we give
last to first then it retrieves the
latest data where Emily will be shown as
developer now select that
and now you can close the brackets and
press enter so let's add that to all the
rows there you go now you can see Emily
Clark Peter and James all they have got
their updated job profiles as you can
see in the original data Emily is a
developer now so is Clark who was
originally a tester and he got promoted
to development team in 2021 similarly
Peter became a senior Finance executive
in 2021 and James the manager of sales
now let's try to find out out the bonus
for all these employees based on their
salary so this one is quite simple so X
look
up now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary
range then here is another important
point so here you might want to find the
exact match but finding the exact match
will not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38,000 22,000 39 Etc
but here in the ranges we have provided
10 20 30 40 and 50 so what if the value
is between and 20 that's when you want
the less number right that's when you
want the number which is equalent to 30
or less than 30 which happens to be 15%
so that's how it has worked here that is
0.15% bonus to the actual salary now we
are on our Excel sheet here you can see
the employee names and employee IDs of
different employees from different zones
let us imagine that the blue one is from
East Green one is from West and the
black one is from or the purple one is
from South and the orange one is from
North so this data is a little small but
what if you had a data with hundreds or
thousands of rows including all the
employee names employee IDs or another
relevant data type like sales of an
employee and his employee ID and you
were supposed to combine all the data
from all the four different zones into
one single sheet it would consume a lot
of of time right so recently Microsoft
has released some latest updates based
on arrays and datas so one of those is
vstack function in Excel so how to use
it since it is a latest function I
recommend you to go to the file menu and
in the file menu you can navigate to
account and in the account you can see
the option of update options then you
can select update now and your Microsoft
Office will be updated to the latest
version and you'll get access to the
latest functions in Excel and all the
other office related things like B one
presentation Etc now we going to
implement the vack function in Excel it
is completely simple all you need to do
is equals to stack and then select the
data remember to select the data from
column A and cell two or the row two we
are not selecting the employee name and
employee ID we are just selecting data
now separate them by comma then again
this one here this set and again this
one and again lastly this particular
last set now close the bracket and press
enter and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee IDs all together in one data
set so this is how you use wack function
in Excel now here we have four different
sheets of the sales so so the first
sheet is the West Zone next is South
Zone East Zone and central zone so all
this data belongs to one single sheet
that is Superstore data set so I have
categorized or I have taken a part of
the data which belongs to central region
South Region west region and east region
now we are going to use all these four
sheets and create one single sheet which
is the pivot table of all the four
sheets now without further Ado let's
start the process now for that we might
want to use the shortcut key that is alt
D now press P now this starts the pivot
chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for you now click on next
now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range add
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have
South and finally we have West
now we will name these according to the
regions so the first one will be
West next one will be
South next one will be
East and the last one will be
Central click on next and here select
new worksheet and finish and there you
go you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the submission
value so click anywhere on the pivot
table and change it from count to sum so
so that you have the summation of the
total number of sales subcategory sales
and grand total of sales Etc now here
you can see all option now let's select
Central and you'll get the details of
the central region the grand total and
the sales happening quantity of sales
Etc now here can you can see the
furniture office supplies technology and
the grand total all in one single sheet
now let's get back to the original sheet
so as you can see this is the original
sheet and in the original sheet you can
see various more
categories which is the which is the
shipment mode customer customer segment
country City State uh and you also have
uh product name subcategory Etc so if
you had added all these into this sheet
you can also create a separate option of
adding my new details to your pivot
table so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets so slic in
Excel are software filters used along
with Excel tables or Excel pivot tables
over a large amount of data not just
filtering out data but slices also help
you with an easy understanding of the
information being extracted and
displayed on the screen now Microsoft
Excel slices are compatible with Windows
and Mac and Tosh operating systems now
let us understand how to implement
slicers in Excel so for that we might
want to get back to the Practical mode
that is starting our Microsoft
Excel now we are on our Excel sheet and
as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which is been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this license
in Excel we must might want to create or
convert the format of database into a
normal table for that you can select all
your data and just press contrl T and
that will allow you an option called
convert the data into table now since
this table is already converted as a
table we can directly start implementing
or inserting slices into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data
then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
options since we have the columns
employe ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees date of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our
slices now let us try to rearrange these
slices all you can do is just select and
drag them
up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the EAS Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony bner Fred Etc
and their Department designation etc etc
all on one single screen so this really
helps you while you're presenting your
data in a presentation now for a change
let's try to select the department now
if your client wants to select the data
from only analytics Department then you
might want to select on the analytics
key on the department slicer and there
you go you have an employee called luk
hops who works in the East Zone and his
department is analytics and his
designation is contract based and the
salary he is getting is
65,000 now similarly
uh you can see that we have only
selected analytics and your client also
wants data from it support now you can
see that analytics is gone but what if
you want both analytics and it support
then you have an option called select
multiple then you can select analytics
and it support and if you want HR you
can also do that and in the zone if you
want West along with East then you can
do the same east and west and you have
all the employees details and in the
designation let's try to select U senior
traine okay select multiple senior
training and manager so that's how you
do it so that's how it's done and that's
how you implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation so what is
suon Excel now you might want to
calculate uh the total sum of sales
right so let us assume that this is your
entire stores sales data and you wanted
to calculate the entire sum of sales so
there is a sum function in Excel where
you just have to you know select all the
sales and apply some function onto it
and you'll get the sum of all the sales
right so with something like this you'll
select all the cells and then you'll
apply a sums function and you'll get the
sum here and average everything right so
this is fine but what if you just wanted
to find the sales that are happening in
only western region as you can see our
column f is based on region so we have
four regions South West East and Central
so your manager asks you to find the
sales happening in suppose say west
region so how do you calculate it would
you manually go into each cell and check
if it's West and calc that will be time
consuming right so what if you had a
method which could do it for you just in
a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly summs so so it
will basically add a condition calculate
the sum of sales where the region is
equals to West simple to like or similar
to Cal query right so that is exactly
what we're going to do in Excel today
that is using Summers now let me add
here Sales of West Region now in the
next cell let's add a suus function
remember there are multiple sum
functions in Excel so when you type in
suum
you can see so many options based on
some right you just have some followed
by that you have some if it is just some
if not some ifs today we are
concentrating on some ifs so not just
some if we'll go to some ifs so we'll be
having an option of placing multiple if
conditions there so let's also try that
more on that later now let's press tab
to select our sum FS function now okay
we forgot another important step so
before we apply sufs we need to convert
our table into a table format yes it
looks table but right now it's not in
Tabo format it is in the format of
database we know that Microsoft Excel
considers its data as a database by
default so to convert the database into
table just click anywhere on the data
and press contrl T so that you'll have a
new dialogue box and it will ask if your
table has headers just make sure that
you have tck in it our table does have
headers so select okay
now our database has been converted into
a perfect table and it's ready for
applying sums function so now you can
see our database has been successfully
converted into our table now let's begin
with our sufs now again remember we are
using some ifs here not Su if or sum so
select sum if and press Tab and we have
our sums function now the first step
which colum are we looking at what are
we finding out right which is a sum
range what sum do you want for now we
need some of sales so select the sales
column and we have a simple key function
here let's hold control again press
shift and hold shift together so we're
holding control and shift key together
and now we're pressing lower Arrow key
once yes the entire sales column has
been selected comma Now where do you
want to look so we want to look I mean
which part of the table you want to
fetch right so this is the region part
we want to fetch right now so again hold
control and shift together lower Arrow
key the entire column is selected now
the next last part so we want to look
into the both of the columns that is
sales column and region column now which
type of data you want so for now we want
Western type of data that is the sales
data which is happening only in West
right so we'll select this cell with the
data as W or you can also manually enter
it for now let's select the data so I'm
selecting this F7 which has uh data as
West right now let's close the
parenthesis and press enter so there you
go you have the sales happening in the
western region now you can also try to
format it in the form of currency so
let's use uh dollars since it is based
on American states so let's use dollars
so there you go now we are having the
sales data of West now let's try to copy
the same to all the fores and uh now
here let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening in West and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay a fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy this sell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another input here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
so it is expect that you are looking for
adding another criteria right now which
column you want you want category so
let's select category you want to select
all the cells same trick control shift
lower key and again press comma and you
wanted to select only uh Furniture so
select on furniture cell there you go
now press enter so there you go we
successfully have the sales data from
west region based on category Only
Furniture so that's how you do suf in
Excel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sums function in the same way
all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use sus in Excel how to create
drop- down list in Excel now for that we
might want to switch to the Practical
mode now we are on our Excel spreadsheet
and here you can see I'm trying to
create an calendar for the employees in
the company where you might have to you
know write down the day and month and
year or week of your birth date or maybe
your joining date or maybe also your
last working day right this might be
useful for all the employees to you know
uh avoid them from writing it down
manually so how do I create it so it
takes a few simple steps all it takes is
some data validation methods and also
there is an exclusive video specifically
made on data validation in Excel link to
which is in the description box below or
you can search it on our official
YouTube channel now you can see that uh
the word calendar is on the first cell
that is A1 but we have four cells below
it that is A3 B3 C3 three and D3 so you
might want to add this to all the cells
right like may be in the middle so for
that you can do the option of mergin
Center also there is a tutorial on
mergin Center about all the options
available in this particular thing so
you can go through that also and uh here
we have done the first step now all we
need is day month year and week so in a
calendar or in a month you'll have days
from 28 29 30 or 31 days right so let's
create a list or the drop down menu for
that so that whenever you click it right
so whenever you click on that particular
cell you will have the list of all the
days available right so let's get
started with that let's create a new
sheet so why are we creating a new sheet
you won't want that all the numbers in
your calendar sheet right over here
right so for that so we are creating a
new sheet and all the data will be
available here so here let's write down
the days first and here the second
number also you can use the option of
Flash Fill so that you can you know uh
reduce the effort here so you can see
the flash F option over here all you
need to do is select the CES and drag
them down until you get your required
dates right so let's keep it till 31
days there you go you have the days so
these will be your days and here now the
next option was month right yeah month
and year now using the same flash F
option you will you know add the months
into your sheet so this will be
Sunday so Excel has this smart flash F
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be filled according
to your requirements so Sunday to
Saturday now the next one right that is
your
month so same as the before process
we'll create
January now you can use the flash Bill
option and all the way up to December
now the last one was the
year so
1990 and 199
21 so you can select the cells and Flash
Fill Up to
2022
maybe yeah 2022 should be good enough
now this is the flashfill option you
have here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on flashfill Al together you
can go through it for a detailed
explanation as well now coming back to
the original sheet so this is where you
create create your drop down list right
so select the cell where you want to add
the drop down list navigate to data and
then here is your data validation menu
so we have a variety of data validation
options over here there is an exclusive
tutorial on that you can go through it
for now we'll look into the list option
only because we want to create a drop
down list right so here it will ask for
Source click on the source here the
source bar right Now navigate to sheet
number two where we have the days
options select the
range so this will be your range and
select okay also you can add some
message here right what you can do is uh
in case if there is an error or
something right you don't want that to
be happening so all you need to do is uh
right down select from
dropdown
select from drop down
only so this could be a message select
from drop down only the title is Select
options or just
options in case if there's an error you
can write down your title as invalid
data and you can write down a messages
please
select from drop down
only so um in case of someone tries to
write as 32 or 33 to check the Integrity
of your data validation then they will
encounter an error and an error message
and then they must be understanding what
exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and valid so okay and
here you can see select from the
dropdown list only options with option
list as title and let's try to enter 32
right and when you press enter you will
see an error
so the error messages invalid data
please try to select from drop down only
so you can go for a retry and select the
drop down
right so let's eliminate them and now
select something from the drop down so
let's take it
as maybe 10 right so this is how you
cleared the day one now let's try to do
with the month same data validation
option
settings will be list and Source will be
this
one think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet 2 and
Brin in this as our week yeah now coming
back to the month
again it will be a
list and the source will be in sheet 2
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and input message the same
options select from dropdown
only and error alert title will be
invalid
data this one will be please
select from drop
down
on
it's okay and that's done now let's
continue with here as well let's quickly
do the
same
it will be a list Source will be in
sheet
to this is your list press okay and
lastly the week same process it will be
a list show will be in your sheet
two input
message
options thatle invalid
dat let drop down
only
right so your drop down list is ready
now so the month will be anything So
currently we have me and here can be
anything anywhere so let's take it as
997 and we can be you know the adjacent
week so what was 10th of May
1997 let's check our
calendars
was a
Saturday so it was a Saturday and that's
how you create drop down list in Excel
and if you want you can also add borders
to your calendar right
so that's how it's done what is a pivot
table a pivote table is a tool that
summarizes and reorganizes selected
columns and rows of data in a
spreadsheet to obtain a desired
report it does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives pivot tables are especially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be time consuming to calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a p table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
displays the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is a good time
for us to analyze India's last census
data from 2011 and see where different
states and cities across India stood in
terms of population literacy and other
socioeconomic factors we will analyze
this data by creating different pivot
tables in Excel and explore some of its
features so let's begin first I'll show
you one of the features that Excel
offers us so suppose I click on any cell
and hit control+ Q you can see our
entire table is selected and at the
right bottom there's an option of quick
analysis now you can see by default
Excel has prompted certain features such
as formatting we have charts totals and
there's one more called tables now Excel
by default has created some P tables for
us now the first one you say sum of
district code by state names next we
have sum of sex ratio by state name then
we have some of child sex ratio some of
male graduates and some of female
graduates by state name and there are
others before creating our pivote table
so let's have a final look at our data
set
so First Column you see is the city
column so there are different cities
from different parts of India then we
have the state code we have the state
name district code we have the total
population followed by male and female
population next you can see we have the
total literates from each City then we
have the male and female literates next
we have the sex ratio then we have the
child sex ratio next we have total
number of GR graduates and finally you
can see we have male and female
graduates so using this table we'll
create several peot
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the total population for each
of the states in descending order so to
create a peot table you can click any
cell in your data go to the insert Tab
and here left you can see we have the
option to create a pivote table so let
me select pivote table now my range is
already selected the entire table and
here I'll choose existing worksheet
because I want to place my pivote table
in the same worksheet and I'll give my
location I'll point to cell Q5 now let
me click
okay you can see the peot table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name onto rows so here in our
poo table you can see we have the
different state names listed now we want
the total population for each of these
states so in the field list I'll search
for total population which is this one
and drag it under
values you can see we have our sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I right click go to
sort option and choose Z to A that is
largest to smallest you can see here in
2011 Maharashtra had the highest number
of population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andra Pradesh and if
I come down we have nagaland and andan
and nicobar Islands towards the end so
this is a simple P table that we created
now the next problem we have is we want
to find the total sum of literates in
each City belonging to a state so let's
see how to do it I'll click on any cell
go to insert and here I can click on
pivot table my range is selected I'll
choose existing worksheet and give my
location which is Q5 I click on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all the
states next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then we'll drag City onto
rows you can see here we have our pavot
table
ready to the left of the pivote table
you can see we have the state names and
the cities per state and on the right
you can can see the total number of
literates from each City if I scroll
down we have Assam then you can see we
have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
that's Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
Karnataka and other states as well
moving
on okay so the next thing we want to see
is what is the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state with that
we also want to find the states that had
the highest and lowest sex ratio in
2011 so let's create a peot table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average sex
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want to see it based on different
states so what I'll do is I'll take
state name and put it under rows so here
you can see we have our pivot table
ready on the left you can see we have
the different state names listed and on
the right we have the values now we want
to find the average Now by default Excel
will sum the numeric columns you can see
it tells you sum of sex ratio and child
six ratio so what you can do you can
click on this drop down and go to Value
field
settings and here summarize values by
you can choose average you can see the
custom name it says average of Sixx
ratio click on
okay our entire column is now giving us
the average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into average
I'll again click on the drop down go to
Value field settings click on average
and click
okay and you can see here we have the
average of child sex ratio for each of
the states now the next question says
which states had the highest and lowest
sex ratio so we'll consider this column
so we'll sort it in any order you want
you can do it either ascending or
descending let me sort it in descending
order you can see we have our column
sorted now so in 20 2011 Kerala had the
highest sex ratio and if I scroll down
to the bottom you can see himanchal PR
this had the lowest which is around
[Music]
818 up next let's explore one more
feature of peot table so suppose you
want to see the top or bottom few rows
of a peot table you can do that as well
so here we have a question at hand we
want to find the top three cities with
the highest number of female grad
so let's see from the entire pivote
table how we can filter the top three
cities so I'll go to insert click on the
P table option go to existing worksheet
click on Q5 and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows and then we want the female
graduates so in the search bar I'll look
for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the highest number
of female graduates in the top three
cities so let me first sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can say that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities but
it's displaying all the cities for us so
let's filter only the top three so what
you can do is right click and go to
filter under filter you have the option
of top 10 I'll select this here I only
want the top three so either you
can go down like this or you can
directly type three your column is
already selected Ed let me just click on
okay there you go we have the required
pivot table ready and it only displays
us the top three cities with the highest
number of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a peot
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and Karnataka so let's
create a p table for this and see how
you can use a slicer to filter the table
click on existing I'll click on a
location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values and then I'll
select the
city onto rows and then the state name
also I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the P table all the states and
their cities and on the right you can
see the total population for each of
these cities but our question is we want
to find only for Rajasthan and Karnataka
now for that what you can do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option and
here you have the option to create or
insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll search for these
two so here we have Karnataka so let me
select Karnataka
first
and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our pivote table we
only have data for Rajasthan and
Karnataka so this pivote table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and similarly we also have for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do
that I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty
cell okay now here since we want to find
the percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literates onto values followed
by female literates on two values by
default it has summed up the male
literates and female literates value and
also I want to drag State
column to rows
so here you can see the sum of male
literates and female literates per state
I want to convert this as percentage
contribution so what we can do is I'll
select any cell and I'll right click and
I'll go to so value as and here I have
the option to select percentage of grand
total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male literates through
the total now if I sort this you will
get to know which state contributed or
has the highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
male
literates then we had utar Pradesh in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and Andaman
and nicobar
Islands as two states which had little
or minimal contribution to literates
similarly let's do it for female
literates I'll go to so value as and
select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature to convert your data and see it
in terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto row and let's
drag the city column onto
rows next we want female graduates so
let me look for female graduates in the
field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and to the
right of the P table you can see the sum
of female graduates from each
City now first I'll sort this column
I'll right click go to sort and click on
sort to largest now we have sorted our
female graduates
from shortest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to this
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now
I'll replace top 10 with bottom and I
want the bottom three cities from each
state I have my column selected that is
some of female graduates if I click on
okay you can see here some of the states
don't have three cities so you can see
andan and nicobar islands has only one
city that is Port player while the
remaining you can find the bottom three
cities with the lowest number of female
graduates so Andra Pradesh had these
three in Assam we had Naga then there
was dier and ccha similarly if I come
come down in harana we have palwal
kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka there gangavati this Rani
benur and this scholar similarly you can
see for Kerala as
well now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a p table so in a p
table you can create or use custom
formulas to create calculated Fields or
items calculated fields are formulas
that can refer to other fields in the
pivote table calculated Fields appear
with other value fields in the pivote
table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
sum of followed by the field name so
here we have a sales table that has
columns like the items which has
different fruits and vegetables and
those have been categorized as fruits
and vegetables we have the price per kg
and this is in terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you can do that with the
help of a pivote table I'll create a
pivote table
first click on an empty cell
hit okay now if you see on the top under
pivot table analyze and under
calculations we have the option Fields
items and sets if I click on this drop
down I get the option to create a
calculated field or insert a calculated
field and click on this I'll give my
field name as sales and I'll select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I'll
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculated field that
is present in the pivote table fields
which is seals but it did not add it to
our original table or original table is
the same but here we have added a
calculated field which is present only
in the pivote table list now we can use
this it has already taken it under
values now let's say I want to find the
sum of sales for each item under each
category you can see it here we have our
category fruit and we have our category
vegetable and under that we have
different items like Apple apricot
banana similarly in vegetables we have
broccoli the carrots corn eggplant and
others so this is how you can create a
calculated field in a pivote table now
this's one more good feature that Excel
offers us in pivote table is to create a
pivote chart so you can use your pivote
table and create different charts so
I'll show you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts I click on this Excel
gives me some default charts which you
can
use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
Excel has created this is called a
pivote chart now here you can see the
category fruits and vegetables and the
different fruit and vegetables or the
items in the y axis you can see the
total sales if you see from the graph
guava meet the highest amount of Sals
now if I sort this let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I sorted and changed my poo table
the P chart also automatically gets
updated similarly there are other chart
charts also that you can create let's go
to the insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pie chart so this is a pie chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our pie chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the pi
that has the highest area represents it
had the highest amount of sales in this
case you can see it is quava and
similarly we have other items as well
this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivot table go
to insert and under recommended charts
let's now select a line chart if I hit
okay move it to the right so this is a
line chart you can see it starts from
guava which had the highest amount of
sales then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800
rupees and our lowest was eggplant at
900 rupees for fruits papaya sold the
least at 700 rupees let's take another
chart I'll go to insert under
recommended charts let's see this time
we'll see a bar chart now this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
take the area chart for now so this is
an area chart again it looks similar to
the line chart it starts with guava
which had the highest amount of seals
similarly papaya under fruits had the
lowest amount of Sals under vegetables
it was broccoli and finally eggplant
made the lowest amount of sales under
vegetable now let's go to our first
sheet and summarize what we have done in
this demo for pivot tables in Excel so
we had our
data this is a 2011 Census Data from
India we have had the different cities
the state names and we had the total
population total literates female
literates male literates we had the sex
ratio total graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple pivote table
where we calculated the total population
for each state and sorted it in
descending order we found that
Maharashtra utar Pradesh had the total
population in
2011 then we saw another preot table
where we calculated the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical column so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex ratio
you after that we saw how you could find
or filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater Mumbai and bangaluru with the
top cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a p table so we sliced our table
based on Rajasthan and Karnataka State
and saw the total population for all the
cities in Rajasthan and Karnataka
in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates one thing
marked that some of the states did not
have three cities for example Andaman
had only one city that was Port player
but the others we found out the bottom
three cities that had the lowest female
graduates finally we looked at how to
create a calculated field in a pivote
table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called sales and then
we explored how to create different
charts and graphs so this was an area
chart that we saw there a column chart
we also saw or looked at a bar chart
that was a horizontal bar chart
similarly we saw how to create a pie
chart as well now at times you might be
working on a really important
spreadsheet on your Excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some paret issue and you forgot to
save or you missed to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly to discuss the same and see
how to do it in multiple ways so Excel
comes up with an option to automatically
save the data also it will try to warn
you that your data is not being saved
would you like me to save it or not
right so we'll do the first one so here
you have the autosave option you can
either say okay to it or you can ignore
it in case if you ignore it if you
choose to ignore it or if you choose to
manually save it and then if you want to
close the file remember we haven't saved
the file if you if you wish to close it
Excel will automatically come up with a
dialogue box asking you want to save
your changes to your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of bar issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open or try to start Excel when you get
the power backup again and if you want
to open that same data file it will ask
you the document recovery option it says
you have closed the file without saving
the changes and you can choose to you
know come back from the same place where
we left last time okay now that was the
paret issue and now let's see uh another
way okay let's imagine that somebody uh
eliminated few important data files from
your organization's confidential data
employee ID employee name Etc and again
uh let's simulate the force uh close of
the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data was been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place so this was one way also we have
another few multiple ways just we have
to navigate to file and here you can
open and in the open menu you have a
button called recover unsaved workbooks
not just the current workbook it will
also have all the remaining files which
are related to excel that are not saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option we can just
navigate to info and there you have
another option called manage workbook
and in the manage workbook you have
another option called recover unsaved
workbooks which will also redirect you
to the same file that is Microsoft
Office unsaved files and you'll have all
the unsaved workbooks which are related
to excel so this is how you can Rec
cover the unsaved data in Excel using
multiple ways first thing Excel will
automatically ask you if you have to
save the file or not and in case if you
forget to save it you can directly
recover it by default by Excel it will
automatically show that some folder was
not saved on the left side of your Excel
spreadsheet by default and in case if
you missed out on that one you can
manually go to file and you can either
choose open option or info option to
recover the unsaved folders from your
default file location from your PC that
is Microsoft Office unsaved files
Etc which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to Excel and
