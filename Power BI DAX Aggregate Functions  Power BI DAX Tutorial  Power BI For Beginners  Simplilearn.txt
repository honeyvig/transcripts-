without further delay let's get started
with data analysis expressions in PBI
now when you're discussing about the
data analysis expressions in PBI Then
There are a wide variety of Dax in PBI
so Dax can be assumed similar to the
calculated fields and formulas that you
generate in form of a query on your data
using power query in powerbi now let me
bring that to a little simpler level
okay now you might be having sales data
and quantity of a certain product order
let's say you wanted to identify the
cost per product then what you would do
is a simple mathematical calculation
which is total sale divided by number of
quantities ordered of that particular
product then you will get the product
price
right so similarly if you wanted to
calculate some aggregate functions like
sum minimum maximum average count Etc
then you can use Dax and there are quite
a few more other than just the aggregate
functions let's take a look through
those firstly we will have the aggregate
TXS functions in powerbi so aggregate
Dax functions can calculate a Scala
value such as count sum average minimum
maximum Etc there are a wide variety of
aggregate functions like distincts
approximate distinct count average count
Max minimum product sum Etc and followed
by that we have date and time tax
functions in public VI so the date and
time functions will help you create
calculation based on dates and time many
of the functions in Dax are similar to
excel date and time functions however
Dax functions use date and time data
type and can take values from a column
as an argument now we have calendar
calendar Auto date dat Dev date value so
most of these functions are already used
in Excel and you might have a quite
comfortable understanding of all these
DX functions from Excel now if we move
forward we have another function which
is filter Dax function in PBI so the
term fil filter function is
self-explanatory the filter and value
function syntax are some of the most
complex yet powerful and differ greatly
from Excel functions the lookup
functions so usually we used to use the
V lookup H lookup X lookup and index
match functions for carrying out the
lookup operations these are a little
different from Excel so you can find all
cross filtered all except all no blank
row Etc and a few more right so these
are the next category of Dax functions
moving ahead we have the logic Dax in
PBI so The Logical functions act upon an
expression to return information about
the values or set of expressions for
example you can use the IF function to
check the result of an expression and
create conditional results so we have
and bit and bit shift bit or bit zor and
a few more in this particular area now
if you move ahead we have trigonometry
Dax and PBI yes trigonometry you can
actually use S cos Etc in the Dax
functions of PBI so here you can see the
math and trigonometric functions so we
have abs we have aost a cost h a Cod Etc
and uh the next part of the Dax will
cover time intelligence Dax functions in
Fabi so the time intelligence Dax
Expressions include the time
intelligence functions that enable you
to many manipulate data using time
periods including date days month
quarters years Etc and the new Dax
operators in
powerbi so the Dax operators are the
four different types of calculation
operators that are athematic comparision
test concatenation and logical so they
are plus minus star slash and
exponential now other than this we also
have a few DXs which are newly uploaded
from Microsoft for PBI setup so those
are right over here so Dax is
continuously being improved with
functions and functionality to support
features new functions and updates that
are included in service application and
Tool updates within most cases are
monthly now for this particular tutorial
we will be focusing on the first
category of tax functions which is the
aggregate tax function in powerbi so the
most commonly used aggregate Dax
functions in powerbi are average count
distinct Max minimum product sum Etc now
we will just look into a practical
demonstration to understand the realtime
implementation of these most commonly
used aggregate Dax functions in powerbi
so let's quickly shift to the powerbi
desktop version so now we have started
the bi desktop version and here we have
our data so you can see average sales
category City so let's let me open the
data set right over here so here you can
see the sales data of um Superstore so
we will be having the row ID order date
order ship date ship mode customer ID
Etc so this is the particular data we
will be dealing with today so I think
the power query mode so that we have a
detailed understanding so here is the
Excel data that we will be using today
so we have the ru ID order ID order date
ship date Etc so we will be finding out
let's say maybe you wanted to find out
uh category wise average sales or
category wise complete sales in a
specific region right so we do have
regions over here which is southeast
northwest and if you wanted to uh
extract some insights based on a certain
city based on a certain category let's
say you wanted to extract details about
corporate sales happening in England
region England state or country uh
Inland State and North Region right so
such queries can be executed I mean to
say you can filter out the data that you
want to extract and explain it to PBI so
that it gives you what you're looking
for so that's what tax is going to help
you with now that we have a brief
understanding of
what data we are working on and what we
are trying to extract let's go ahead
with PBI and try to execute these
insights using the tax aggregate
functions so there you go we have
started our Pap Pi let's quickly load
the workbook that you're working with so
um here it is just select the data and
press load there you go we have the data
right yeah there we have have it now so
we know what exactly we going to do with
that so to have a better understanding
how exactly tax is working on our PBI
let's go with the tabular type of data
visualization which is easier and
simpler to understand so I'll create a
table Type U visualization right away
here and um now we will have different
zones regions right so let's have the
regions and yes we have the regions over
here let's expand the table a little bit
so that the data is visible clearly
let's expand it to 100% a little more
there you go we have it now let's say we
wanted to find out the number of orders
we receive from these zones right so you
may have to add a new measure or to
create a new Dax operation you may have
to click on this particular data over
here just right click and you will have
an option of add a new measure and a new
dags window is going to pop right in
front of you now here you have it now
let's name the measure as number of
orders equals to so let's say uh if you
wanted to find out the total number of
orders from a specific region what you
would do is just count the number of
orders received right so all you have to
do is uh call the count function and uh
data so you will be counting the number
of orders so order ID you will be having
a unique order ID for every purchase so
that would be the right uh piece of data
you'll be trying to count here just
press Tab and that will be selected
enter and you have a new uh Dax
operation right here just select that
and you will be having
the number of orders received from each
region right let's try to calculate the
minimum orders received from a Zone uh
let's say maybe from okay let's try to
add a new slicer or a filter onto our
canvas so here you can see the icon for
slicer there you go you have added it
now let's keep it somewhere okay let's
keep it here and uh in the fields I'll
add uh maybe category just drag and drop
it in the fields now you have all the
three categories uh you have furniture
office supplies and Technology right now
let's do let's try to calculate the
minimum orders received from category
now let's try to add another table you
can just drag and drop it anywhere there
you have it in the same way let's try to
right click on data and add a new
measure and this time we will name it as
minimum orders
received you can call the minimum
function and you can call data and Order
ID enter so here you can identify which
was that uh least performing category or
least performing product and the highest
performing product minimum and maximum
correct so now you can call category
okay we can use the category over here
so you can just call the Region again
and you can also call the minimum
orders so minimum you might have to edit
a little count of orders close the
bracket enter and then now you will have
the number or you can just uh minimum
sales you can just ident ify minimum
sales that are happening over here press
enter now you'll be having a number of
sale right how many dollars of purchase
has been done from a region wise
perspective in Furniture category and in
office supplies this is the minimum
orders you received and Technology wise
and if you just click on anywhere in the
canvas I think you will have all the
three there you go now uh similarly if
you wanted to create another table for
maximum SA TS to just check out the
maximum aggregate function you can do
that and uh right click on data to
create a new
measure and here Max
sales equals to Max function you can
just call the max function and data of
sales press tab to select and enter now
you can call the segment and you can
call the max of sales in that particular
segment right now you can also add a
slicer for or slicer or a filter for
your region or like we did here for
category so here we can add a region
wise filter and you can find out which
segment has given you the maximum sales
or the minimum sales and the count of uh
you know orders received and Etc so far
we have understood the the count
function count aggregate function
minimum aggregate function maximum
aggregate function the filters and
slicers used uh maybe we can also
explore with Su so basically some is
just an aggregation of total orders or
total sale or anything it's just adding
up all the numbers so here we have a
some aggregation as well so basically
that's how we have a basic understanding
of aggregate functions completely
similar to excel so this is the basic uh
part of Dex in PBI where you can
Implement all the aggregate functions
aggregate mathematics iCal functions and
with that we have come to an end of this
session on dags expressions in powerbi
on the first part which is aggregate tag
function Ty and uh if you have any
