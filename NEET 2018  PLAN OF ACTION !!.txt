yeah hi everyone the daughter clicker
from Emily's conquers so here I am to
just give you a brief introduction or
information about how we work
I mean how the modules or the how the
modes here goes okay so coming to the
pattern of pattern of shady long pattern
of schedule is actually this is of 12 to
13 months okay 12 to 13 one schedule
which is generally categorized into
three parts one is test mode okay and
the second is one day mode
and third is t21 okay so these are the
three categories either like by that by
the time we complain the complete one
day mode you you people will be ready to
cue in in normal fashion
so after ames november session it's
going to be the t20 mode everyday we are
going to have one subject contribution
to ready for the December week so this
is what the 1082 plan of action so it's
very simple that test mode is a place
where we give more importance to each
and every a corner of the subject okay
we are going to consider every quadrant
of the subject and you are going to have
lots of discussions related to the
particular subject in and around like 6
days discussion per week so we are going
to have a discussion of 1 & 1/2 over to
2 hour every day and we are going to
cover the maximum stuff as possible and
we are going to concentrate mainly on
the important stuff that need people are
very concerned about that particular
subject
so this duration is going to be in and
around in and around like 6 to 7 months
we are going to give the major
importance for the test mode because if
you take the recent need examing to
consideration if you take the recent
need exam into consideration problem
with the more than thousand students I
have an analysis that most of the
questions in the recent need are they
are related to the basic stuff okay
basic stuff in a sense like even Ackley
free if you take it a clinical subject
there are much concern to the basics of
the cylindrical subject there are much
concern to the basics of the basic
subject so the basics are more important
rather than working on a numerical lot
working on something which is very hyper
because they have not asked any -
questions the papper it strike forward
single liners diagram based questions
are also so what related to the medical
medic
partial measured of the scoring path is
very simple and it is it is like a basic
spot okay you need to learn something
like basically for any subject we are
going to start with the definition of a
particular topic right so they are much
concerned about the basic stuff okay so
my consent of the team concerns of MDS
concurrence to work on the basics work
on the basics and like you the basics
and make you well versed with the basic
stuff which are important for the
examination point of view in that in the
case of an a single liners because the
single liners I feel like according to
my analysis that I feel like single
liners are the one which are going to
grab you the maximum score which is
going to make a difference between a
seat getting on a person who disqualify
so feed getting is the first step that
we are going to make you or submerge
your module to the strategy in the test
mode which is going to be in the
duration of six to seven months okay so
six to seven months we are going to
cover as much as stuff as possible right
so the second mode I mean the first mode
will be entered by tentatively it will
be entered by the July first week ok by
the July 1st week we are going to done
with the first test mode so once we are
done with the test mode we will enter
the one-day mode which is going to be
completed by 29th I mean the last week
of October
last week of October followed by one
week we are going to have a quick
revision to the aims that will be there
on the number okay now the first week
the aim should be there so a quick
review of the number and we'll make you
two ready this one demos for the number
n followed by once the a inches done we
are going to have an a a span of 21 to
25 days for your last exam that is the
December need so 25 to 20 days is like
we are going to have a cute empty mode
that we are going to cover one or two
subjects per day in combinations like
also pedo calls endo so the most cool
stuff will go in combination with with
revision followed by some more and we
are going to have a brief chart okay
about discreteness so each and every
subject is going to be done three times
in Candia spoken okay I hope you guys
are clear about this so the next is like
the next most commonly asked outs from
students is one is the new bass starting
so the simple answer for this is others
want to give a simple answer
MDS conquer module is prepared in such a
way that this is going to be the test
mode okay so we are going to start with
a particular status for example just
thing like we are starting with indoor
so they're starting with gender so once
the test mode is done then we will go
for the one day mode one day mode is
going to start we can do again
so once the test mode is done it starts
with endo we cover all the subjects in
and around 20 to 25 subjects we come
back at a point so the one day mode is
again going to start with an endo same
stuff a better fast we go fast same
stuff like same stuff you can access
very stuff with an actuary points and we
are going to inculcate you the
motivation encouragement and lots of
other things will be added as an
ingredients in this one day mode and the
one day mode starts you
endo and and at this point so the next
mode Mosul is going to be your t20 mode
again t20 mode is going to start with
the Endor so we are going to touch every
subject three times endo one in the test
mode endo once in the Wonder mode and
the ones in the t20 mode so endo is
covered three times not only end of each
and every subject which are important in
examination point of view will be
covered price in MDS conquer so for
example you are into the group or you
are into the test series at for example
like you are into the test series a
general pathology okay
so simple is like you are going to cover
the test mode of jungle starting from
jungle path and ends with at this point
again you are going to start the one-day
mode and ends up with the general path
again again you are going to start with
the feet on T mode and enter with each
other for example if you're starting
into the group at the pier you better
don't you will have parry oh here you
are
failure here so Ferriero you are going
to cover three times pathology are going
to cross three times
endo you are going to cover three terms
so this pattern will go in cycles okay
you may miss one cycle but you can
encounter the same subject in the next
round or in the next next round so this
is what the this is how the module is
prepared to to to overcome the backlogs
to work on the cumulative effect of
students who are joining or entering the
session or the dead series in the middle
so it's very clear if you miss for
example it's like a day and night cycle
if you meet one day night I mean if you
miss a night
so let's there a night is going to come
again so that is what a simple logic or
which the conquered team and we work so
these are the few things that students
keep on pinging me about like when the
new test fit is on yeah
every week a new that series is going to
suck okay I hope you guys are clear
about this mode of action okay and one
more important things that these all
stops and the videos make a no these are
exclusively for only NB a--'s conquer
students okay that's all people they can
go through but it's just too analyte or
to redirect the students who are going
in the wrong direction
I just want we have this course we have
discuss about this in the recent the
Hyderabad interaction that has taken
place recently
I mean after talking with many of the
students
I mean fickle minded people particularly
in terms I would be a conclusion that I
need to share this stuff with you guys
okay I just want to make clear few
things about the preparation so first of
all I don't know why I can see many
individuals who are joining groups okay
this is what many people many people of
the need who are preparing for the meet
they are they are in this particular
groups of and be part one and and be
part two I don't know why okay
I was talking with an intern and she
came and she answered me she stole that
sir my senior stole that nvd people are
preparing the passer for the meat okay
this is wrong statement okay it's not an
BD its MBE so please make a note okay
clear note that NBD is different and B
is different okay please be very clear
about this I don't want you guys to
waste time of this and vde groups which
is I feel like there is no way related
to other stuff okay please concentrate
on nbe not and be de there's the first
four most important thing I just want to
analyte you so apart from this there is
one more strategy which was which was
made by the team of India's conquer
after having a sadder interaction with
more than thousand students who have
recently given the examination of me
2017 and
it was like taking majority of stuff for
the things was taken from the people who
were cleared with a decent cranks in the
nba's need 2017 so first of all I would
just want to tell about a few things
okay Luke and okay the blueprint was
given by this and the people but they
have not followed it okay so there's no
point of fighting with them just the
smarter people will just keep silent and
they work on the things okay there's no
blueprint followed and the second one is
like according to many many people and
many many - Venters they told that this
passage few session papers I mean you
know that it's going to be four days and
it's going to be - two sessions per day
total total it is eight and they don't
like one or two sessions of half of a
tutor okay I agree for that the tapas
are too tough to does in a sense simple
simple simple I can make it very simple
the 40 questions from biochemistry
obviously to make a paper cup right a 40
questions some pharmacology makes a
paper tough unknown questions will make
the paper tough simple simple logic so I
want you guys to make the things very
simple okay I mean you can go you can go
for the first finger than an aspirant
particularly the person who is sitting
at home for all the nice parents will
use this more if you use this more I can
just tell you neat books okay they are
bulk number of books where you can start
your preparation but logically like know
you have eight months I feel like
smarter people will not start the things
with these books because these books are
going to take more than
sixteen months or the preparation so
double the preparation pattern okay
generally the repeaters will go for the
16 months preparation whereas I mean it
may be impossible for an intern to work
on these books in this little span of
time of eight months so I mean we
prepared a model in such a way that we
are going to give much importance to the
stuff which are very important like we
enlightened we purify we segregate the
stuff which is more important just by
following the general logical rules that
80/20 a simple a simple 80/20 rule 80/20
rule is like 80 percentage of questions
in your final exam will be from 20% ends
of syllabus very simple so 80% in
scoring questions will be from 20
percentage of the syllabus so what is
the 20% is in gentle point of view is
the next question that many of the
students can ask you so just sign in
okay be with us for example I just want
to give an examples like few things
which are very important if you want to
study the most common for example if it
is going to be the odontogenic cyst and
odontogenic tumors the simple example is
like this is the most common cyst which
is the most common developmental cyst
which is the most common implementation
which is the most common non order
doesn't exist so if there is the
perpetrator is much concerned about this
way majority of the times these are the
four things is more comfort same goes
with the tumor most common second most
common most common in the maxilla and so
like the most common is the one that
it's going to carry 50 percentage of
what in any point of view like most
common drugs most common things that are
used in the general purpose for example
local anesthesia for sure you will have
a question general anesthesia for sure
you will have a question and it said you
will have a question antibiotics you are
going to have a question simple fluoride
you are going to have a question
foreign sick odontology we are going to
have a question as ethical innocence
alkalosis relations will have a question
so there are few topics where you need
to give much concerned so your paper is
going to move around those it's not
going to decide your best rank but it's
going to decide your qualifying score
for example half of the marks will be
from the as already discussed like 60 to
70 to 80% of the score will be from the
important stuff so if you if you grab
this important stuff and if you focus on
these stuff definitely your score is
going to be in the computation so once
you are in the computation you can work
more with a beautiful strategies in the
smart work and make unwanted see getting
score into a decent ranks and can stand
as best whatever you do so so this was
this is what I just want to give you and
coming to the diagram this stuff I mean
like hardly five persons are there in
the each session and in few sessions
there just three questions in the recent
weeks
so you account I'm not giving a surety
that it's not going to be they are not
going to be any more diagrams of the
need but there will be dragons I feel
like there will be definitely there will
be increasing the number of diagrams of
the upcoming need so those are for that
strategy as we always give importance
like a trial version of a needy end okay
number range is a trial version of a
December need as a tagline the many
other members like if you are planning
to go for it it is learning
move to the aims so I feel against is
going to carry 20 to 25 sometimes and
recently I have seen 26 to 27 diagram
based questions in the number session of
the end so I feel like you need to give
importance to diagrams because diagrams
are the one which are the graphical
representation can imprint your brain
okay for example if you are reading a
synopsis sort of software you're reading
it in circles
compared to the synopsis in the MC cubes
which are all the written matter a
diagram is going to have a good
perception to your brain so you can
remember a diagram for more days when
compared with a regular single- or a
multiple-choice question for a synopsis
so I feel like in using the diagram
based for including the diagram these
things will definitely increase your
memory power and perception so these are
the few tips just want to share with MDS
conquered students please try to focus
try to work more these are the few
things where we need to work smart knee
smartness is more important because you
need to travel you need to travel or go
this journey in eight months right now
we just have eight months and we have
bulk of things I mean bulk of target to
hit with us so you need to be smart just
mark and we will surely make you more
smarter okay thank you and all the best
signing off dr. Slater bye take care
