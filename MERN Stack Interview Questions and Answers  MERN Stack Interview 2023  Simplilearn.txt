stack is a popular web development stick
that includes four different
Technologies mongodb crashes reactors
and node.js mongodb is used for the
database express.js provides the
back-end framework react.js handles the
front and node.js is used as the
server-side runtime environment
so this stack allows for creation of
Highly scalable efficient and responsive
web application
hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel today we'll take
you through the most frequently Asked
interview questions in Moon stack web
development in this video tutorial we'll
cover all the Technologies related to
Moon stack but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have regular
updates on multiple Technologies so if
you are a tech geek in a container Sun
for the latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and press that Bell icon
to never miss any updates from Simply
low for those interested in a
comprehensive coding bootcamp we highly
recommend the Caltech coding bootcamp
with this program you can learn to code
and become a full stack developer in
just six months this state-of-the-art
bootcamp will fully immerse you in
accelerated coding training helping you
become a valued software engineer ready
to take on any challenges in the
industry
during this boot camp you will Master
both front-end and back-end Java
Technologies starting with the basics
and progressing to the advanced aspects
of full stack web development
you'll also learn angular spring boot
web services jsps and mongodb to help
you launch your career as a full stack
developer
for those who are looking to deepen
their understanding of full stack web
development or simply want to become a
full stack developer in a shorter amount
of time a Caltech coding bootcamp is an
excellent option so without wasting any
more time let's hand over this session
to our training export the react is
interview questions
now as we know it react.js is as
important as like in other tools which
you've already has seen so what is the
jsx here jsx called JavaScript syntax
extension
okay so this syntax extension to the
JavaScript in reactors is in the way
how you express
to bind JS and HTML together to result a
j6
content so by using j6 you can write a
structure in the same file that contains
the JavaScript code that is something
more Innovative way because of that
react.js is creating a more buzz in a
market
so jsx actually helps making code more
easy to understand and debug and avoids
a lot of boilerplate code okay inside
the Dom structure
now the next thing is what is the
virtual Dom see the virtual Dom is
representing a Dom in a memory
okay that is called virtual Dom so
manipulating the real term is much more
slower and costly Affair okay because
you need to repaint the Dom over and
over the period of time when the user
changes few things so
when the state change virtual Dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real term
okay
update instead of updating the entire
object so that makes your page to be
load far more faster
okay so in Virtual Dom what happens this
is the real Dom this is a virtual Dom so
the orange color portions which you're
seeing that is basically the changes
which has been made okay these are
called Changed object okay so virtual
Dom is basically compare it's to the
previous state and understand which area
it needs to send for the updates and
avoid the other areas
okay that's what this virtual Dom really
works
so what are react extension react
extensions are many like you talk about
like in flux it is a third party tool
which is responsible to attach
the State Management feature to talk
about react native which is responsible
to develop the hybrid mobile
applications
in JavaScript so these are two very
popular and there are many more which
are available okay so like you talk
about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering okay so Redux and
there are lot many other tools are also
available
so what is an event in react and how
you're going to create that so react is
basically offering the ideas of handing
the event very fairly easy so let me
talk about clicking anything you talk
about taking your mouse somewhere so
these kind of options generate an event
so for that we typically say alert and
you click on this render you click on
this button in a curly braces you call
the function to trigger to event
now what are the components in react
so friends react components are nothing
but a call View
okay like a complex view can be divided
into the smaller portions
a complex UI can be distributed further
to create more better and reusable views
clear so it splits the user interface
into the independent pieces of code
which can be developed and joins
later on okay so that's how you define
the component in and react so in angular
and react in both the areas the word
component is very much used so the
component meaning is very simple you
talk about a view
so what is the state in a react so state
is react is nothing but is the one which
identify what was and what is now okay
if it stores the value for the specific
period of time which changes and react
is basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications okay so keep tracking
about all those States what it was there
like in I'm talking about an
incrementing encounter so that is also
the state a variable there okay so the
state object is always initialized in
the Constructor so it can contains the
multiple properties so this dot set
state is used to change the value of the
state object and set state is
responsible
to
perform the shallow merge between the
new state and the previous state
now the state holds the data that a
component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
accessed as you can see this example
here
in the Constructor we are defining the
super props and the states has been
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state rent
to the state and update the states
what is the higher order component and
pure component react higher components
are the component which are typically a
function okay that takes a component and
return a new component to you by
manipulating few things that basically
designed for the reusing
okay so the higher the components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so to in order to perform some
reusability
a pure components are the components
okay is a variation of react component
that doesn't
that does a shallow comparison of props
and State
okay shell comparison basically checks
what the equality
are we clear now so that's what the main
job
going ahead what do we Implement and how
do you implement react routing so to
implement a react routing react routing
also comes with inbuild
react modules and that particular module
to import it so
here we Define the react modules by
offering the route path where you have a
call left hand side is the name and the
right hand side is a component which you
would like to deliver it now hello this
is Matthew and we're going to be going
through some of the simple questions
that you would be asked during a node.js
interview what we're going to do is
we're actually going to break out the
section into three key areas that'll be
beginner questions there will be an
intermediate questions and advanced
questions and the expectation is as you
go through this video is that these
questions could be pushed together as
you're going through the interview kind
of think of it like this is if you've
answered the beginner questions that you
would get asked at the beginning of the
interview with confidence and Surety
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate Advanced questions
quite quickly and they're looking for
people who can help them serve and solve
their problems at that more intermediate
and advanced level so let's just get
started so the first question you're
probably going to be asked is you know
you know what is node.js you know do you
know what it's for and essentially
node.js is one of the most popular if
not the most popular open source
cross-platform JavaScript programs and
it allows you to build out web
applications that run on the server it's
extremely flexible it allows you how to
implement a lot of solutions outside of
just the the core programming runtime
and it allows you to build Solutions
extremely quickly in an open source
mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications we'll see
this later on and you may want to talk a
little bit about you know using
express.js and how you can build out
apis uh to work with node.js and
connecting to databases such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
blue
so you're going to be a man asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know your answer
and essentially the io refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
IO it's the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked you know can you
explain the difference between front end
and back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
it's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets run in the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of the web application gets run in the
front end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right on the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like Graphics is going to be on the
front end uh apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are using on
the front end so HTML CSS JavaScript
those are all Common Core scripting
languages that you would use you can use
Frameworks such as angularjs and
react.js or view those would be a
front-end Frameworks uh back-end
Frameworks will include Java PHP Python
and node.js are some of the back-end
Technologies you'd also throw in their
dot net as well and it's just a whole
you know Litany of front-end and
back-end Technologies and Frameworks
that you can use and this is a actually
a good point to kind of explain the
experience you have outside of just
working with node.js but other
technologies that you've been working
with that potentially that the client is
also using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me um what it is you know
can you go into a little bit more um
details you know so you can provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to manage online
repositories or modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules
um in node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules like I come with
node.js now right out of the gate and
here are some of the modules that you
have and we also referenced that just
earlier on HTTP is a core module for uh
running a web server uh you have a
utility function that is useful for
developers to assess features within
your node.js project you have a URL
module for any URL passing you'd be
doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over back-end Technologies
such as Java and PHP and particularly
with gyro it's a very mature stable
language it's been around for more than
20 years you know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side and framework are the
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's a keyword there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
uh angular splits web applications into
the MVC and model view control
components whereas node.js generates a
lot of database crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glued to your database
let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
be asking what is the most popular
database used with node.js and there are
a couple mongodb is largely the most
popular nosql cross-platform database
MySQL is also very popular and that's a
more traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js express.js is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's uh the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely faster
processing thing an event based model uh
it really is fast I can't is if you have
something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can then
offload the task to another Solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth
Pro JavaScript is used for building out
your applications with node.js great
lots of people know JavaScript
a restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks
um if you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier
how do you get around that barrier and
so for instance when you're talking uh
to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and but what I do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for
um getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivot to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
designed for streaming huge amounts of
data in and out a con is that node.js is
single threaded and so it can be CPU
intensive but again there are ways
around that and a good way around that
is scaling Your solution and elastic
environments such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command so an example we have
here is uh you can assign a variable and
the variable is going to be for HTTP and
you're going to then require the HTTP
service and that means that the
application itself won't run unless the
external Library the HTTP library is
installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event just think of it
as cause and effect it's just the basic
motion of physics so that's what event
driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event Loop in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event meta has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects uh
within your event and we have an example
of this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and that executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there are two types one is an
asynchronous non-blocking function and
the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order if I
have the API is resolved synchronous
means that when the feedback from the
API is received you have to execute the
response in a series for how the
response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on nodejs we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with a URL module what it allows you
to do is really two things one is that
it provides the resolution passing of a
URLs for Utilities in your application
and then it allows you to extend your
module with built-in Solutions and split
up the web address into a readable
format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which will then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js
um I would express.js is a web
application framework that allows you to
build out Web Solutions for both mobile
and traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
being able to install and web.js is as
simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node packet manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
vars server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one stream through which
data can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within node.js you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as in this
case it'll be hello world and that would
pop out and then the final line is to
then listen that if you go to a web
browser that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and you
know JS and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to logo
host and an app that's running on Port
3000 and then depending on what we get
if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package and a
single file and then you can then share
that with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment
so what is a callback function in
node.js a callback function is
essentially that once you run and you've
triggered an event mongodb has
consistently been ranked as one of the
top five nosql database Management
Systems so if you're someone who's
applying for a position in database
management roles you will almost
certainly be working with mongodb at
some point now whether you are upgrading
your skills or interviewing for a
database management position using
mongodb it's a good idea to be familiar
with the most frequently Asked mongodb
interview questions and answers in the
latter case it is beneficial for you to
prepare for the interview so that you
are not God off guard even if you are
just interested in learning about
mongodb for the sake of upskilling keep
in mind that acquiring this kind of
knowledge may lead you to looking for a
better job which means you'll be facing
an interview sooner on that note hey
everyone welcome to simple Channel I
hope you guys are doing good and staying
safe in this tutorial we'll be
discussing some specially curated
mongodb interview questions that you
must Master to crack your next interview
so without any further Ado let's get
started with today's topic well but
before we begin if you're new to the
channel and haven't subscribed already
consider getting subscribed to our
Channel simply code to stay updated with
all the latest tech content and hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
us so let's get started with today's
tutorial so firstly let us discuss the
agenda now this mongodb interview
question is intended to give you a
general idea of the types of interview
questions you might face now we'll be
covering some theoretical as well as
practical questions in this tutorial now
typically recruiters begin with simple
questions and gradually increase the
difficulty level so in this mongodb
interview questions tutorial we'll start
with the basics and the progress to more
complex questions now before we begin
with the types of questions that are
being asked here's a simple and quick
tip for everyone who is watching this
video now make sure you have the never
give up attitude I know it's that time
of the year where placements are going
in a rampant way but and I know you
might be giving interviews uh regularly
and what if you uh didn't get an offer
in one of the interviews from that so
make sure you have that attitude of
never give up and prepare for your next
interview and whenever you're giving an
interview make sure you are interactive
being interactive is one of the most
best or best way you can say in order to
get uh you know hired by the recruiter
so make sure you're conversing properly
with the interviewer while asking the
questions and finally behave
professionally which is another key
aspect while giving an interview so let
us now discuss the first question which
is the basic question which will be
asked which is explain what is mongodb
and its features so this is how you can
answer mongodb is basically an open
source cross platform nosql document
oriented database management system now
noise sculpin can be utilized as a
substitute for traditional relational
databases like SQL and MySQL which is
dependent on the SQL language right so
if you want to work with large data sets
of distributed data then nosql databases
may be quite supportive which are used
to store large volumes of data in the
form of documents which will offer the
developers the flexibility to work with
the evolving data models as there is no
fixed schema in this now relational
databases such as MySQL and Oracle store
data in tables and rows right they are
based on a branch of a theory known as
relational databases now these
relational databases are structured and
tables can be linked with each other via
a foreign key which is a property of
relational database which is asset
property which is being Satisfied by the
relational database but whereas the
mongodb being a documented oriented
database it can handle only that sort of
information and store as well as
retrieve information from these
documents only it provides the
flexibility as well as scalability that
you want with the querying and indexing
according to your requirement this
mongodb basically is based on json-like
documents where we store all the
information in that so this is how you
can answer the question which is what is
mongodb and its features
well the next question is what are some
alternative nosql databases to mongodb
now we have various Alternatives from
mongodb such as Cassandra Apache
Cassandra is a free and open source
distributed nosql database management
system which is again similar to that of
mongodb to handle large amounts of
unstructured data across the servers
providing High availability with no
single point of failure Apache Cassandra
is a database which can be a right
choice when you need scalability and
also High availability without
compromising performance next we have
redis redis is actually another uh
popular nosql database which is an open
source which is implemented as a
distributed key value store with
optional durability it can be also used
as a catchy Adam message broker also we
have other types other popular noise
databases like Amazon Dyno dynamodb
Apache headspace and neo4j now HPS again
is an open source non-relational uh
distributed database guys it is
generally written in JavaScript and it
is also developed as part of the Apache
software foundation so these are some of
the examples and can be used in
alternative to mongodb
all right let us now move to the next
question which is what type of nosql
database is mongodb now in general we
have four different types of categories
when we talk about in which category
mongodb comes under so basically we have
key value column based document database
and graph database now when I talk about
key value these database store data as
an index key and value pairs this
database is stored data in a schema-less
way example of a key value data store
include Cassandra redis dynamodb and Etc
next we have column based now column
based or column store type of database
is the one where these databases are
designed to store data as Columns of
data rather than as rows as data if it
stores in a row type of data it becomes
a traditional which is not a noise
database right so again example of a
column store databases are hbase even
Cassandra comes under the column based
as well next we have the document data
database which is actually the type of
nosql database that we are looking for
which is mongodb now document databases
had designed to store documents with
each document having a unique key and
popular document databases are couch
base and mongodb and finally we also
have a graph type of database where they
are based on graph Theory so these
databases are basically designed for
data which needs to be represented as
graphs so the data that is present in
this sort of database is interconnected
with multiple number of relationship
between them in in the form of graphs
and trees and a popular graph database
is neo4j as well as big data so this is
what mongodb is and it comes under the
document database type of noise scale
database the next question is how does
mongodb store data now data in mongodb
is stored in based on documents or the
Json style data structures documents
contain one or more fields and each
field contains a value of a specific
data type so mongodb stores data records
as documents which are in the form of
based on documents which are gathered
together in collections so these
documents as we said earlier has a sub
specific data types including let's say
arrays normal General data and these
documents tend to share a similar
structure which are organized as
collection so you can say a group of
documents are kept in a collection it
may be helpful to think of documents as
in a comparison to the rows in a
relational database so fields are
similar to columns and collections are
similar to tables in mySQL database
which is again a no it's a relational
database so this is how mongodb stores
data the next question is mongodb is a
schemailers database if yes how do you
create schema in mongodb now the scheme
of a data base describes the structure
of the data to be stored right in a
relational database the schema defines
its tables its fields in each table and
the relationship between each field and
each table so if you take SQL as an
example which is a schema based database
right so in schema is defined by the
tables and the fields that is the
columns and rows that are present in it
and the relation between them
on the other hand we have mongodb now in
documented oriented databases like
mongodb data is stored in collections of
key value pairs now given that Json is a
schema free data structure and that
mongodb depends on it it would be more
accurate to say that it has a
dynamically typed data so whenever you
create an insert a document to create a
schema it will automatically create one
for you so whenever a document is added
the database will automatically create
the corresponding collection
the next question is how is mongodb
different from SQL and better than MySQL
now mongodb is again a documented
oriented nosql database which is used to
store high volume of data and which
needs to process your huge data in a
quick session now it is a database that
came into picture around the mid 2000s
and it is again considered into the
category of a nosql database whereas
when you take SQL SQL is a programming
language used to communicate with and
manipulate relational databases for
example MySQL now there are quite
differences between both of these
databases basis right being being one as
a relational database the other being
relational and non-relational database
there are quite differences between them
so for example if you take the structure
in SQL data is represented in tables
whereas the data is represented in
documents and this further documents are
stored in collections now schema again
SQL has a predefined schema so whenever
you are creating a table you need to
predefine its schema whereas mongodb
does not have the implications of
specifying any schema before working on
it so it has basically a dynamic schema
next we have this scalability the data
in SQL can be vertically scalable and
when it comes to mongodb both horizontal
and vertical scalable of scaling of data
is possible when I talk about
transactions SQL also supports Atomic
operations and follows asset properties
whereas Bongo DB does not have proper
support for transactions and it follows
cap theorem and finally the type of
operations now some operations that we
perform in relational databases like SQL
for example SQL supports join operation
whereas we don't have the same sort of
join operation and mongodb so in this
way mongodb is different from SQL and in
some ways it is better than MySQL in
terms of processing a lot of
unstructured data and also has certain
features like replication sharding and
mapreduce and some of more critical
features that are not present in MySQL
well the next question is what are the
different data models in mongodb now
data models are categorized into two
types the first one is embedded data
model the next one is referent data
model now if I talk about Emirate data
model embedded documents capture
relationship between data by storing
related data in a single document
structure whereas reference data models
store the relationship between data by
including any links or references from
one document to another
moving on to the next question the next
question is how does indexing Works in
mongodb now a good indexing strategy be
it a relational database or a nosql
database it is essential for ensuring
that your database returns your results
as quickly as possible now mongodb
indexing is a special data structure on
which the index is created to hold the
data of a specific fields in a document
now in the absence of indexing in
mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection which is basically a
collection scan so mongodb indexes make
it unnecessary to perform a collection
scan which involves looking through
every document in collection from
matches to your query it also provides
effective indexing strategy now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or more multiple Fields And
even through throughout a mongodb
database so you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly add let's say
effectively access the data you required
from it and it also provide search
efficiency now indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which will bring
search efficiency in various execution
of statements so this is how indexing
Works in mongodb
so moving on to the next question what
is mongodb replication and sharding now
if I talk about replication replication
means duplicating the same data across
multiple mongodb servers so the main use
of replication is the data is available
at an instant way that is high
availability of data and it also
supports data redundancy and multiple
copies of of the data are being saved
across servers and also it provides data
recovery and backup options as well so
in a nutshell you can say that database
replication is the process of copying
data from one database in one server to
another database in another server
ensuring that the same data is available
on more than one mongodb server so again
the main purpose of using replication is
data redundancy and high availability so
by keeping data several copies or
replica stored on physically separate
servers it will ensure that the data is
protected and it is also accessible
whenever we need and also by generating
multiple copies of your data replication
enables you to increase data
availability which is also another
important factor this is especially
helpful if a server fails so in that
case you can use the replication and
finally you can also recover the data
that is lost due to any uninterrupted or
any hardware failure issues
now if I talk about sharding sharding is
also similar to that of replication but
it is a method of Distributing data
across multiple databases and mongodb
supports this deployment of data with
having large data sets and high
throughput via sharding
so let's take an example so you can give
an example to the recruiter like this
let's say I have a database having 2
million users and it has a capacity
which is 2 million records now what I'm
doing is I'm basically Distributing the
data across multiple databases and I'm
storing different data in different
databases now we have two machines which
has one million user capacity and
another one million user capacity
so in this way you can add more and more
multiple databases in order to store
your data
so by adding more capacity to a single
server such as adding more memory and
processing units or adding more RAM on a
single server that can be done using
sharding
let us now to move on to the next
question which is explain horizontal and
vertical scaling now vertical scaling
refers to adding more resources like CPU
Ram or any hardware or hard drive disk
space to your server which is again a
database or an application server which
is done on demand on the other hand
horizontal scaling refers or involves
adding more processing units or physical
machines to your server or databases now
mongodb which is a nosql database
handles horizontal scaling through
sharding so in a nutshell you can say
that vertical scaling can be used in
order to increase or decrease the
capacity of existing Services whereas
horizontal scaling adds more resources
like virtual machines to your system to
spread out the workload across them the
next question is when should we embed
one document with another so you should
consider embedded document that is sub
document whenever you rely on these four
factors that is when the relationship is
one to few that is it can be one two one
too many but not one to one so for
unlimited use case you should start
considering separating sub documents
into another collection the next
situation is when retrieval is likely to
happen together which will improve the
performance in such case you can embed
one document with another the next
factor is when updates are likely to
happen at the same time you can use this
multi-document transaction by embedding
data model and finally when the field is
rarely updated in such case you can use
the embedded document
well let us now move on to the next
question which is what are replica cells
and explain primary and secondary
replica sets in mongodb the process of
replication as we discussed earlier is
done via using replica sets in simple
words it is a group of mongod processes
to keep the same data across different
servers now a replica set is basically a
collection of related mongodb nodes
which must have three notes at least now
one of them must be a primary and the
rest secondary ones and a replication
structure can have up to 50 nodes so the
main types of nodes that we have is
primary and the secondary or you can
call it them as primary and secondary
replica sets now when I talk about
primary replica set it is the primer is
the member in the replica set that
receives the write and read operations
but read operations can be pointed out
to secondary nodes changing the
configuration at the moment to perform
the query beside is the replica set can
have only one primary node at most and
talking about secondary the secondary is
the node where the data is replicated to
maintain a copy a replica set can have
one or more secondary nodes and the
clients cannot write data to secondary
ones only they can read from them and if
at all there is any failed node it works
as a secondary node again until it is
until a new primary node will be
replaced with that so this is what a
replica set means and the type of
replica set which is the primary and
secondary I hope you understood this
so moving on to the next question which
is what is the use of capped collections
now the size of collection in mongodb is
typically unrestricted right so the
collection increases its size as more
documents are being added to that now a
capped collection is a special type of
collection that has either a fixed
number of documents in a collection or
fixed number of elements so it creates
new documents by overriding the oldest
documents present in that collection so
collections can have maximum size or
document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond the maximum threshold
that is being allocated and all capped
collections must specify a maximum size
and may also specify a maximum document
count only now mongodb removes older
documents if a collection reaches the
maximum size limit before it reaches the
maximum document count so overall the
structure and functionality of a capped
collection supports high performance for
credit operations like create read and
delete so this is what cap collection
says and some of it characteristics and
why we use it
let us now move on to the next question
which is how can you store images videos
and other large files now we often need
to store files in our databases but
mongodb sometimes or it doesn't let you
store any file larger than 16 MB in a
normal document so what you have to do
instead mongodb has a functionality
specifically for storing large files and
it goes by the name gridfs yes you have
heard it right grid FS is a driver
specification for uploading and
retrieval of mongodb files which are
larger than 16 MP in order to store
images videos and other large files it
is one of the most popular
specifications and it it has a size
limit of more than 16 MB so you can
store images videos that have size more
than of 16 MB now chunks of files like
be it and audio it update of PDF file or
anything it is being streamed as a
chunks so these are streamed into the
database and each chunk is limited 255
KB in this size this means that the last
chunk is normally either equal to or
less than 255 KB so whenever you read
from grade FS the driver resembles all
the chunks as needed this means that you
can read sections of a file as per your
query range
so I hope you understood uh what is grid
fs and what is the process to store
images videos and other large files
which is of more than 16 MB so basically
the interviewer want to know that
whether you are not familiar with the
concept of grid FS so that is the reason
he might ask you this question so you
have to be well prepared for it
well the next question is explain
aggregation in mongodb mongodb
aggregation process the data records
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single competent result just
like any other operations that are
performed in a relational database
similar to that aggregation is also used
in order to act on a group of values
from multiple documents present in a
collection to perform operations for
this grouped values and return a single
competed results now it actually groups
multiple documents which applies an
aggregation operation and it is
basically returning as the particular
value that we want from that operation
now there are various ways on how you
can perform aggregation we have three
different ways of carrying the
aggregation process in mongodb the first
one is aggregation pipeline next we have
mapreduce and finally we have single
purpose aggregation so you can further
explain each of these aggregation uh
depending upon the interviewer's
preference so basically I will
irrigation process in mongodb is modeled
on the concepts of data processing
pipeline so multiple document enter the
pipeline and then these documents are
being transformed into the aggregated
results next we have the map reduce as
the name suggests it does to operation
which is mapping and then reducing that
operation so it will map each document
and process along with one or more
objects for each document and reduce
phase in which output of map operations
are being combined together and finally
we have single purpose aggregation
operation where these operations
aggregate all the documents from a
single collection in mongodb now even
though they provide a simple access to
the basic aggregation operations they
lack the flexibility that are being
provided by the aggregation Pipeline and
map reduce operation
so these are the three uh aggregation
pipeline method which they go through
first is basically the math stage which
will filter the records or the documents
we need to work with uh and next it
performs the group operation which
basically is the aggregation and finally
it will sort the data so it will sort
the resulting documents the way we
require that is an ascending and
descending order now just like uh any
other operations given by aggregation in
mongodb we also have five different
types of operations that we can perform
which is sum which will add up the
values of every document next we have
average which will complete the average
value of every document and we have Min
which returns a minimum value from a
document and we have Max which will
written the maximum value within a
collection and finally we have Push
which will add the value to an array in
the document moving on to the next
question what is mean by ID field in
mongodb ide is the field that uniquely
identifies a document present in the
mongod EB collection so when you are
trying to insert a new document into the
database mongodb will automatically
create a unique ID field which will have
a unique value to its name now by
default mongodb creates a unique index
for the ID field during the creation of
any collection and the ID field is
always the first field in the document
and if the server receives a document
that does not have any ID field first
then the server will move the field at
the beginning and also ID field can be
avoided in the document that you want to
return by setting the value of the ID
field as 0 in the query
so what are some utilities for backup
and restoring in mongodb now by default
mongodb shell does not include any
import export of data or even
duplication or retrieval of uh data from
other uh you know applications but
however mongodb provides the utilities
and database tools to take backup and
perform the restore operations now
mainly we have four type of backup and
restoring options which are import
 export term and malware
restore so you can use one of these
utilities like Dom import export
and restore to move your data in and out
of your mongodb database now the most
commonly used are mongodum and
restore the mongodon utility creates a
binary backup you know of a mongodb
database the mongodom tool is the
preferred method of dumping data from
your Source mongodb deployment and if
you're trying uh to restore the data
that you have basically deleted or
dumped you can use the Monger register
in order to fetch back the data that you
have dumped
so the next question is can you explain
about mapreduce process in mongodb
mapreduce is basically a data processing
Paradigm for condensing large volumes of
data into useful aggregated results so
basically mongodb provides the map
reduce features for only aggregation
purposes and generally there are two
phases of the map reduce as you can see
in the name which is mapping and
reducing so in the first phase each
document is processed and emits common
and redundant part of the document to
pass a unique record for the next phase
and in the next phase all the unique
part gets together and aggregated to
produce a single result and finally we
have a query here we'll pass the query
to filter the resultant set so with the
help of map reduce user can perform
sorting filtering and document
modification as per their need
so moving on to the next question which
is how does mongodb Ensure High
availability of data
in general High availability refers to
the uh you know Improvement of a system
or any applications availability by
minimizing the downtime caused by
routine maintenance or any hardware
related uh you know issues so mongodb
automatically stores copy sets and
multiple copies of data distributed
across servers and data centers now in
general mongodb is one such database
which can provide High availability for
the users by using features like
replication and sharding now in
replication the replica sets help
prevent website downtime using native
duplication and automatic failures now
mongodb has a great support for high
availability without no thought through
replication set but replica set is not
enough for a production ready system
that is it requires a bit of planning in
order to deploy this so sometimes it
might be an issue but in most of the
cases if the system crashes or the
hardware or software faces any issues uh
you know ODB in the data mongodb helps
you recover and backup your data in the
system
so the next question is what is the role
of profiler in mongodb now so far we
have discussed some of the basic to
moderate uh level questions guys now
from here on you will find some
practical as well as you know advanced
level questions so you might need to
focus a little bit and even if you're
not confident and if you don't know the
answer which we are discussing now you
can directly tell to the recruiter of
the interviewer that you do not know the
answer but you hope that you have an
idea on this and you can work on that
and you can get back to him so again
let's get back to the question which is
what is the role of profiler in mongodb
now database profiler is used to collect
information regarding the queries which
are executed on an individual database
instance so basically this uh profiler
in mongodb database allows you to
collect performance data about
operations occurring on a mongodb
instance
the next question is can we use regular
expressions in mongodb now in SQL we do
have regular Expressions where we need
uh where we write a query to find
certain patterns that are present in our
database table right in a similar way
regular expressions are also used to
match patterns in a document just like
finding a pattern in an SQL tables so
regular expression basically provides
patterns a sequence of characters for
matching and defining a search pattern
and also retrieving an unidentified
field using a certain pattern becomes
easily within a document and querying a
database in order to find a smaller
subset of data within a collection we
can use regular expression so regex
operator in mongodb provides regular
expression capabilities from pattern
matching strings in the queries and the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name dot file mention the field name and
mention the reex keyword and mention the
pattern now the pattern can be of any uh
of your choice
so the next question is how do you
search for documents in which a specific
field has one or more values now you can
say this is a bit of practical question
guys the interviewer wants to know
whether you are not uh whether or not
you are comfortable and have an idea of
using various operators in mongodb so
you can use the DB dot collection file
operation and also use a query operator
which is dollar in in order to specify
the field and the values that you want
to retrieve or you want to search for
inert document so for example I have
given an example which says that in
order to return all employees whose
title is product manager or executive
director in such case the query would be
DB dot employees dot find mention the
field which is title mention the uh in
which is a query operator here mention
the product manager and executive
director which we are trying to find so
if there is any record or the person who
is associated associated with this title
of product manager or executive director
it will retrieve the record now we have
a person name whose first name is Rahul
and last name is Kumar whose ages 29 and
title is product manager so this is how
you can search for a document with a
specific field which has one or more
values
so the next question is which command
are used to insert single and multiple
documents into a collection now we
basically have two types of commands
which is DB dot collection dot insert1
which will insert a single document into
a mongodb collection and it returns a
document containing the inserted
documents ID field and next we have the
same uh command but the keyword changes
which is insert mini which is insert a
single or even multiple records uh into
a mongodb collection again it returns a
document containing each inserted
document's ID
well the next question is what is the
difference between
all and in operator in mongodb now both
all and in operator are used to filter
documents in a sub array based on a
conditional statement so but there are
some differences or subtle differences
between all and in operator now when I
talk about all operator all operator
retrieves all the documents which
contains a subset of the value we pass
and this subset might be in any order
but whereas in operator retrieves all
the documents which contains the either
of the values we pass
moving on what is the next question is
both rights and rates become faster when
you add more slaves to replica set as
the statement true or false explain the
reason well this statement is false now
a replica set can only have a primary uh
at any particular time that is having a
one master with other nodes the
secondary nodes being slaves so all
right operations are performed only on
the master node read operations on the
other hand can be performed on any
instance which can be a slave or a
master node so as a result adding more
slaves to a replica set accelerates only
reads operation and nods the and not the
rights operation so the statement is not
valid and it is a false statement we
cannot uh you know write and read both
uh operation when you add more slave to
replica set
the next question is what is Shard e and
mention the components of mongodb
sharded cluster now what is a short key
chart key is used by mongodb to
distribute the documents of a collection
across charts now on charting a mongodb
data set a Shard key is automatically
created by default so the short key can
be in the form of indexed field or
indexed compound fields that will be
used to distribute the data among the
shots generally The Shard key is used to
distribute the mongodb's collections
documents across all the shots where the
key consists of a single field or
multiple fields in every document now
the idea is to have multiple replica set
with multiple primaries which would
basically divide data and load it among
themselves and each of these replica set
is called as shard
chat basically has three components
which is basically Shard Mongoose and
config serger all this together
comprises of a mongodb sharded cluster
now when I talk about Shard what is a
Shard Shard contains a subset of the
sharded data okay A Shard is basically a
single mongodb server or a replica set
that stores a partition of the
application data that you have divided
now next we have the mongos Mongoose
router or the it is a router of
operations now because each chart
contains only part of the cluster data
you need something to root operations to
the appropriate charts that's where
mongos comes in the Mongoose process is
a router that directs all the reads
writes and commands to the appropriate
shard in this way mongos provides client
with a single point of contact with the
cluster and finally we have config
servers now Mongo's process are
basically a durable should be durable
that means it must be in a position to
store the metadata in order to properly
manage the cluster right which we have
formed with the short key so that's the
job of the config server this metadata
includes the cluster configuration the
location of each database collection and
the particular range of data there so
this is what basically shark Key is and
multiple components that are included in
the mongodb sharded cluster
so moving on to the next question which
is the joint plus is a key feature of
relational database systems what is the
mongodb equivalent if any and are there
any limitations now whenever we hear
about joints we have like different
operations like inner join after join
left join and uh you know cross join so
similarly we have a question here that
means if we talk about no SQL that means
we do not have no joints that means we
do have joints or we do not have joints
that's the main question but the thing
is we have a joint equivalent in mongodb
also which is the lookup operator which
is a significant disadvantages that is
it does not work in charted collection
right so it's worth noting that rather
than looking for a direct equivalent to
join mongodb developers often simply
denormalize the data and which
eliminates the need for a join you know
operation in a mongodb database so in a
nutshell you can say it performs an
outer join to a collection in the same
database to filter the documents from
The Joint collection for processing now
the lookup operator adds a new array
field to each input document and this
new array field contains the matching
documents from The Joint collection
so the next question is mention some
pros and cons of normalizing data in
mongodb database now normalizing data is
a key factor in relational database but
what about mongodb now updated documents
is fast for raw normalized data and it
is relatively so slower for denormalized
data well on the other hand reading
documents is fast in denormalized data
and slower for normalized data so
denormalized data is hard to keep in
sync and takes up more space so rdbms
generally have this organic support
for normalization and a lot of data to
be managed as a separate entity whereas
nosql dbmss like mongodb do not have
this active support for normalization
so the next question is what are the
advantages of using mongodb now there
are various advantages of using mongodb
for example it is an open source DB that
is it is ready readily available for
everyone to download and perform the
operations right away and it is also
easy to use the syntax is also user
friendly just like SQL it is also highly
flexible which allows you to store and
work on different data types and allows
you to store unstructured data of
different types in one or more documents
and the security is also a Paramount
Feature for any user right so mongodb
provides Advanced security features as
well and we also talked about high
availability in our previous question
and it also has reliable indexing for a
faster retrieval of data it has a
flexible schema design unlike the uh
predefined schema in relational
databases so this flexible or the
dynamic schema design allows you to meet
the ever-changing conditions of the Big
Data applications uh you know with the
vast amount of data that is being
incorporated into the documents you can
have a better Edge on the data if you're
working on large scale applications then
moment DB can be a great choice for you
with all this it also gives you high
performance which is another key feature
of mongodb and one of its greatest
advantage of a noiseql database
and that gives us the last question of
our interview question uh which is what
are some applications of mongodb now
mongodb being a nosql database is widely
popular in many uh sectors nowadays and
some of the major applications or
real-time use case of mongodb is it is
used in iot which is internet of things
with the world rapidly uh advancing in
uh you know in technology iot plays a
crucial role and it is important that we
uh as a user you know have these uh
intention to store that data and have
that data predicted in any sense now the
data is only getting larger and larger
and we also heard this phrase that data
is the new oil so with the coming in the
coming years the data is exceptionally
going to rise and we need mongodbs to
store this uh huge or huge volumes of
data into our uh databases right so it
is one of the applications of mongodb
and we also have mobile applications and
in order to perform real-time analysis
and we also have uh it is also used in
catalog management content management
and for product management and various
others sectors as well now companies
also like to use noise databases uh
because of its flexible uh design and
the need of you know storing data
without any uh predefined schema makes
it a best nosql database like companies
like eBay Shutterfly New York Times
Verizon and many other big companies use
uh mongodb nowadays and also the one of
the real life application or use cases
the best example you can give is aadhar
card which is India's unique
identification which is uh based on
identifying a person's you know identity
so the other uses mongodb to store this
massive amounts of demographic and
biography biometric data of over more
than 1.5 billion uh you Indian users so
other users mongodb in order to store
the images QR code details you know the
personal details of the user in its
database so these are some of the
applications of well that's a wrap on a
