hey what's up Traders I'm Guy Sebastian
and in today's video we're going to have
another look at Pine connector today
we're going to break down the pine
connector settings and the syntax
commands for sending alerts from Trading
view to metatrader to autot trade our
Pine script indicators and strategies
I'm going to open up the settings for
this expert advisor um in the previous
video I recorded on a 4K resolution so
you'll notice this dashboard thing looks
kind of janky in the first video of this
series I'll record on 1080p for the rest
of the series so this looks normal don't
be alarmed by all the red in this uh
dashboard I accidentally left the trade
open from the last video and it racked
up a pretty big loss on euro dollar but
luckily this is a demo account that's
why we use demo accounts for this sort
of thing when we're learning and setting
up um tools like this I do have pine
Connector running on a live account it's
running on my ultimate pullback
indicator um you can get more
information about that on our website
pinescript mastery.com if you're
interested it's um got full integration
for Pine connector all you need to do is
insert your license ID and any relevant
parameters for Pine connector and it
will automatically send any trading
signals to Pine connector and it's
working really well over the past few
weeks so towards the end of this series
after we've gone over a lot of the um
core fundamentals of pine connector I'll
revisit that script I'll show you what
the results are and we'll break down
what I've learned from that experience
and what tips and advice I can give you
guys um but anyway let's get into the
pine connector settings if this is the
first video you're watching make sure to
go back and watch the first video in the
series I've got an instructional video
on how to set this up for metatrader 4
and 5 two different videos I'm using
metatrader 5 but it shouldn't matter
what platform you use the settings will
be slightly different in some areas but
the core fundamentals are all the same
so I'm assuming you've already set up
Pine connector and today we're going to
open these settings to do that we can
just right click our chart we come down
to expert list and then click properties
now again you will need to use your own
license ID you can't steal mine um
because it's linked to your metatrader
account number so yeah don't try to use
mine but the good news is you can sign
up for a onee free trial if you're not
confident that this is worth your money
yet and you can play around with the
full functionality of the tool for that
full week all right so let's break down
the core settings here I'll just do
these quickly because in future videos
we'll go over practical examples of
these settings with actual scripts so
obviously you need your license ID
that's the most important input here if
you don't put this in correctly then
this tool will not work the next most
important setting is our stop loss and
take profit setting so by default it's
set to Pips that is the recommended
setting for Pine connector but there are
other options here so if we set it to
Pips then when we send SL and TP in our
alert syntax so open up the charts these
settings here and it does matter which
order you put these in by the way when
whenever you send an alert to Pine
connector we need to first put our
license ID then a buy or sell or pending
limit order command then the currency we
want to trade then we have our stop loss
and take profit and risk if I set both
of these to 50 and we open up the
settings and have this set to Pips then
our stop loss will be 50 Pips from the
current market price when our trade is
executed so we would have a 50 pip stop
loss in a 50 pip take profit if I change
this to price then these values need to
be price values so if I wanted to put my
stop loss at uh
1.58 I would type in here
1.58 and now my stop loss would be a
price value but my takeprofit also needs
to be a price value so we change this to
1.62 that would give us a roughly one:1
risk reward profile if our trade were to
be entered at 1.06 the current market
price and then the final option here is
percentage that's exactly the same as
Pips but obviously percentage based so
most Traders probably wouldn't use this
option maybe crypto Traders might uh but
for Forex Traders it's unlikely you
would ever use percentage based stop
losses and take profits most of you will
be working with pips but we do have the
option for price as well if you need to
use that option again the recommended
option is Pips because that helps
alleviate the issue of the pricing
discrepancy between metatrader and
trading view when your trade is entered
it's entered at metat Traders price and
so if you enter your stop L and take
profit based on Pips that keeps
everything as consistent as possible
across both platforms next up we have
risk so the default setting is set to
Lots so if we set our risk to one and
look on the left here we have these um
example parameters if we set risk equals
1 in our alert then our position size
will be whatever number we put here so
in that example it would be one standard
lot if we put 0.1 it would be one mini
lot 0.01 would be a micr lot there are
other options here dollar amount
percentage of balance based on lots and
margin available margin and then finally
percentage of account balance as a loss
so this is the most commonly used one I
would imagine this is the one I use in
all my scripts and this limits my loss
based on a percentage of my account
balance so if I set risk equals 1 and I
have this set up in the pine connector
settings then if my trade loses I will
only lose 1% of my account balance
now on the settings page there is more
information here so under volume there
is a description of each setting so go
and read this if you want to know more
about these middle three options but for
me I will mostly be using percentage of
account balance so that's what I'll
leave this on for now next up we have
our pending order this is our entry
order so if we send an alert of buy or
sell like this that's a market order but
if I change this to buy limit or sell
limit now we're placing buy and sell
limit orders and if we are sending buy
or sell limit orders this setting comes
into into play so by default it's set to
Pips from current market price so if we
send an alert that says price equals 10
then our buy limit will be set 10 Pips
below the current market price on Pine
connector uh on metatrader same as our
Target type so our Target type has Pips
price and percentage so does our entry
pending limit order Pips price and
percentage most most of the time we will
be using Pips um but I'll show you some
examples of these others in future
videos finally we have account filter
basis and we have four settings here
balance Equity margin percentage and
free margin let's go over to the
settings page and read what these do so
this setting helps filter the trades
that Pine connector can take so if we
choose balance and we set account filter
to 1,000 then the signal will only be
processed if your account balance is
greater than 1,000 if it's set to equity
then our open Equity needs to be greater
than 1,000 if we set it the free margin
then our margin needs to be greater than
1,000 and margin percentage is the same
as uh free margin but uh but obviously
this will only be processed if your
margin percentage is more than the
specified number so I personally don't
touch this setting in my own trading or
rather I don't send this parameter in my
alerts but this parameter here is there
for you guys to basically control your
risk that's what this setting would be
mostly used for that way
that way if your script goes ballistic
and starts pumping out dodgy trades um
you have like a a break an emergency
break limit um if your account balance
Falls below a certain number the expert
advisor will stop taking trades or if
you just have a lot of um signals being
generated and you don't want to take any
trades when your margin is used up for
example so you're not getting margin
calls anyway moving on to input so here
is like a master override that you can
um input so that when you're trades are
received by the expert advisor these
settings are used instead of whatever
you send from your alert I've never used
these settings um so I'm not going to go
over these but this option is here for
you if you need to do this for whatever
reason um personally I like my script to
send my trade parameters so I leave this
setting as it is um so let's move on to
General pyramiding so typically
pyramiding is used to add to winning
trades the first setting is on if you
set this to on then all incoming trades
will open without restrictions so if you
have a hedging account that allows open
long and short trades on the same symbol
then any long and short trades that come
in will be will be allowed to execute if
you select on if symbol and direction in
profit so this setting here then the
trade will only open if if you have no
open trades on euro dollar or your open
trades on euro dollar have a profit
that's Break Even or better and if we
set it it to off either one buy or sell
then if you have one trade open on euro
dollar then a short trade will not open
or if you have one uh Buy trade long
trade on euro dollar another long trade
will also not open and then finally we
have off only one buy and one sell this
will allow one long trade and one short
trade to be open on the same symbol so
these are advanced settings for accounts
with hedging enabled um some Brokers
allow you to have that setting enabled
so that you can have long and short
trades open simultaneously I personally
have never played around with that just
because it adds a lay of complexity to
the back testing process that I'm not um
comfortable dealing with I just can't be
bothered I'd rather have a simple system
that trades either long or short at any
given time it's a lot easier to back
test and prove that it works on
historical data so I keep this um off
typically so I'd usually have this off
either one buy or one sell um or there's
another setting down here Max open open
positions per symbol I'll usually just
set that to one and leave this on that
way only one trade is open at a time but
anyway we'll get to that next up we have
close on reverse close on reverse
determines the treatment of opposite
signals so this is another setting that
I've never played around with personally
perhaps we'll cover this in a future
video if you guys are interested in this
but personally I leave this off and as I
said I I stick to simple systems when
I'm automating my trading next up we
have Shadow targets I'm actually not
sure what this is let's have a quick
read Shadow targets hides your intended
stop loss and take profit now I actually
have no idea what this is we'll have to
play around with this in a future video
I've again I've never used this setting
I'm not sure what that does Shadow
targets hides your intended stop loss
and take profits I'm guessing it means
it doesn't enter these stop loss and
take profits into the market to hide
your stop- loss and take profit from
your broker I'm guessing that's what
this does we'll have to play around with
this in a future video moving on partial
close percent percentage this determines
the percentage of your positions to
close when using the close long percent
and close short percent commands so we
have three options 25% 34% and 50% this
is obviously useful for scaling out of
positions instead of exiting your trade
entirely this is also not a setting I've
ever played around with perhaps we'll
cover this in a future video if you guys
are interested in that uh next up we
have Max open positions this defines the
maximum number of positions across all
of your symbols so if it's set to zero
the pine connector EA will not limit
your position count if it's above zero
then uh Pine connector will limit how
many open trades you can have
accordingly so let's say you set up
alerts on like 20 different markets but
you only have enough money in your
account to have three or four open
trades you might want to set this number
to three or four that way you won't be
getting margin calls and trades trying
to execute when you already have a lot
of open trades um and then finally we
have Max open position positions per
symbol which does exactly what it sounds
like defines the maximum number of
positions per symbol um I typically set
this to one um because I as I said I
trade simple systems that only have one
open trade per symbol I prefer to trade
lots of symbols and only have one trade
per symbol then have lots of Trades
executing on a single symbol just makes
it a lot easier to go through the
strategy development process and back
testing for me personally the way I do
things all right let's wrap this video
up with the last few settings categories
here next we have dashboard that is this
dashboard here and um we'll maybe break
this down in a future video cuz there's
a lot of information here to dissect but
uh this shows you your p&l and your
performance metrics for your system
since um from Pine connector's
perspective based on live executed
trades you can see my giant loss here
from the trade I left open from the
previous video and if we go to the
documentation here um the settings we
have to work with are profit computation
so by default it's set to calculate your
p&l while including commission taxes and
swap fees so that's really cool that
gives you a very realistic portrayal of
your systems performance metrics um then
you also have the option to display this
information without commission taxes and
swap um but your results will be um
better than realistic when you have this
setting turned on because it's not
taking into account all the hidden costs
of trading in terms of system
development so your back testing results
will usually not show this information
at least not on trading view since
trading view doesn't have access to this
information from your broker directly so
these are the sorts of things you need
to factor in during your system
development and back testing process but
by running your system on a demo account
or a small real money account for a
couple of weeks you should get a pretty
realistic representation of how your
system's performing with these fees um
included in that performance you can
also change the font size and turn the
dashboard on or off um so if we go to
experts properties
dashboard um you have three options here
Tech size on or off and the uh
calculation technique then we have some
risk parameters here so let's go over
the documentation for these um first we
have daily profit this determines your
daily account takeprofit the daily
recompute occurs at midnight GMT so
that's important to know if you're using
this set if it's off then your system
will just continue taking trades
regardless of how much profit you make
in a day if it's below one then you're
using a percentage amount so 0.1 in this
parameter here would turn your system
off it would stop allowing Pine
connector to take new trading signals if
your profit for the day exceeds this
number personally I've never been a fan
of limiting The Profit I make in a day
but there are probably reasons to use
this um especially if if you're trading
a managed account and you're trying to
keep your performance metrics and your
Equity curve volatility in a certain
range so a number below one would be a
percentage amount so 0.01 would be 1%
0.5 would be 50% so on good luck making
50% in a day um but if you do more power
to you if you set this setting to a
number greater than one then this is a
dollar amount so 100 would mean that if
your account makes $100 worth of profit
your
um expert advisor will stop taking
trades and you can check the day's
profit Target using your experts log
which is this setting here next we have
daily loss which is exactly the same but
obviously limits your daily loss which
is a setting that it makes a lot more
sense for me to use Um this can stop
your system from going haywire if your
system is taking a lot of Trades and
you're racking up losses quickly um
setting a daily loss limit can protect
your account from that happening again
if you're trading managed accounts you
might want to turn this on so that you
don't exceed your daily loss limit if
you're a retail Trader you probably use
this mostly to protect your account from
something going wrong with your system
or maybe you're a day trader and you
want to limit your loss for the day not
a bad idea to use this setting if you're
trading lower time frames especially and
it works exactly the same way as the
daily profit limit um but obviously this
is losing percentage and losing dollar
figures and then we have our action so
this is the action the EA or pine
connector will take if one of these um
thresholds are hit so halt EA will stop
the EA for the day and it will restart
automatically on a new day which I'm
guessing is midnight GMT as it says up
here so at midnight GMT your daily p&l
will reset and if you have the setting
turned on um the new day's p&l
cumulative p&l will be acted on on
accordingly you could also set it to
close all positions so if your daily
profit or loss is hit it exits all of
your open positions or the third option
is to close all positions and halt the
EA so if you just have halt EA on and
your daily loss limit is hit for example
then all your open positions will still
play out so if you've got stops and
targets set the trades will play out as
they were set up um but no new trades
will be taken however if you set close
all positions and hold EA then it will
exit any open position positions and
also hold the EA so you'd probably want
to use this setting if you're going to
use a loss limit on your uh account next
up we have cumulative profit so this is
like the daily p&l um setting except
it's for cumulative profit since
Inception so since you started running
your system um this setting will add up
your pnl so we open up experts
properties so we have a daily profit and
daily loss limit limit and an according
action and then we have a cumulative
profit and cumulative loss limit um
and a ea action so we can hold the EA
for a day we can hold the EA permanently
until we turn it back on manually and
then we have our same options but we
close all positions or we close all
positions and pause the EA for the day
or we close all positions and turn the
EA off until we manually override this
and that's it that's the core settings
for Pine connector again we'll go into
more detail on these settings in future
videos as we start coding scripts to
send this information these parameters
directly to Pine connector from Trading
view alerts so that we can automate our
trading um so far we've only done test
alerts using uh test alert syntax in
future videos we will code all of this
and I'll give you a template for a
script that includes all of this
information so that you can set up your
alerts like I have here with my UPI I
can select my script select any alert
function call make sure my web Hook is
turned on and my license ID is inputed
into the script and then whenever my
script detects a training setup an alert
will be generated and sent to P
connector you can see here a signal is
being detected if this signal closes
valid so this bullish engulfing candle
closes with all the conditions met in 45
minutes from now uh Pine connector will
execute a trade on my Live account so
really cool stuff here really powerful
um it's a really powerful tool for
systematic Traders I hope you found this
video interesting thanks for watching I
love you guys I'll speak with you in the
next video where we'll start coding
we'll go into more detail about the
syntax so so far we've only really
covered fixed profit and uh stop losses
and risk in future videos we'll cover
more Dynamic stuff like trailing stops
how to exit trades so for example based
on exit reasons so if I come up to the
settings of my UPI and scroll down to um
exit settings I've got the option to use
a trailing stop here that will use a a
trailing stop to lock in profit so once
my target is hit the script will start
trailing my stop loss until it's hit we
can send alerts to Pine connector to
update our stop loss as it changes or I
can tell Pine connector to close a trade
when an exit reason is detected so if I
say so for example if I turn on use
higher close lower close exit as soon as
my target is hit and we get a candle
that closes above the previous candles
high I can tell Pine connector to exit
that trade at Market so there's some
really cool powerful combinations of
settings and script parameters and code
that we can use to create pretty
versatile trading view systems that can
be automated through our broker using
pine connector that's where the fun
stuff will start to happen in this
series so make sure to subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I'll
speak with you in the next video take
care good luck with your trading now
none of this is trading advice be
careful out there it is possible to lose
a lot of money if you don't know what
you're doing with this stuff so take it
slow start with the demo account if
you're going to play with this tool
treat it with respect and you should do
just fine have a fantastic day and I'll
speak with you soon
goodbye
