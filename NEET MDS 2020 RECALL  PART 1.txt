happiness this is dr srikan from team
mds conquer
now i'm here to discuss few questions
from mds conquer neet
2020 recall so going into the question a
50 year old patient
few days after the extraction of
mandible or third molar
experience difficulty in breathing
intraoral examination reveals
restricted mouth opening and raise time
what can be the diagnosis of this case
options are here a submandibular
cellulitis
b ludwig's angina c tb lymphadenitis
b lymphoma after
so before going into the question you
need to identify the key points the
first key point
is extraction of mandibular third molar
the next one experience difficulty in
breathing
raised mouth opening and
raised tongue and restricted mouth
opening so
if you go to the etiology the most
common ethiology for ludwig's angina is
the infection of the third molars the
infection of
the mandibular molars is the most common
ethiology
which is given in the question and of
course the most common cause for the
death
of ludwig's angina case is obstruction
of airway
and the emergency thing or the emergency
treatment what you have to
do for ludwig's angina case is relieve
the obstruction of airway which
which can be seen as a difficulty in
breathing you can see
a mouth open appearance in the case of
ludwig's angina case that is the
restricted mouth opening and you can see
a peculiar tongue that is raised
so with this you can confirm or you can
conclude the diagnosis as authentic
angina
if you go in detail into the few
questions which were given in various
examinations
uh uh the questions which moves around
ludwig's angina
the tongue is called as udam so when
when you have a description of woody tan
you can blindly go for ludwig's engine
as a primary option but this type of
woody tank can also be seen in the case
of actinomycosis
of course we have to learn about woody
lakes woody legs are seen in the case of
vitamin c deficiency woody gums are seen
in the case of
so let's learn about woody tongue all
goodies right woody tongue is
ludwig sanchin and acrylomicrosis woody
legs is vitamin c deficiency and woody
gums are anak
and three peculiar features that you can
see in ludwig's angina are the first
important thing it's an indurated
swelling okay
brownie injury rated spelling is again a
most common key term that is used in
describing the ludwig sanjina
and which doesn't pits okay the swelling
doesn't fit
and mostly it's going to be a bilateral
spelling it's always a bilateral
spelling never
and unilateral spelling so other
important point that you can add
is a bilateral a bilateral bony spelling
is seen in the case of cherubism
cherubism is again a bilateral one right
and you can see one more bilateral
swelling bilateral salary and swelling
are seen in the case of
mums okay so bilateral salivary gland
spelling
is seen in the case of mums bilateral
your bony swelling is seen in the case
of
your cherubism right so again the third
i mean the the one more like bilateral
spelling which involves
three types of lymph nodes that is the
submandibular lymph nodes
submental lymph nodes and sublingual
lymphoids okay so all these lymph nodes
on both the sides
they cause the swelling and of course
the most important thing is already
discussed it is open mouth appearance
you can see a clinical photograph of
ludwig sanjin i guess you can easily
identify
a mouth open appearance the mouth cannot
be closed
okay and the next important aspect of
the question which is given in various
examinations long back
is the standard airway for ludwig's
angina is crico
crico okay so the standard airway is
trichothyrotectomy
and the next important thing that you
have to make a note about ludwig's
antenna is the organisms
which are responsible for the occurrence
of fluidvig sanchez so this is again
again a most commonly asked question
that
what are the organisms which are uh
basically responsible for the occurrence
of ludwig sanchina and these organisms
according to the textbook is
steptoc alki and
various
mixed anaerobes okay the streptococcus
and various mixed anaerobes
are the causative organisms
so the answer for this question is the
ludwig sanjin i feel this question is
one of the easiest question
in your neet 2020 recall
