future project eight bug bounties and
hackathons
a bug Bounty is a program that allows
organizations to incentivize the
identification of security
vulnerabilities and bugs in their
systems and software typically through a
financial reward system companies often
offer bounties for the discovery and
reporting of vulnerabilities which may
include monetary rewards recognition or
other incentives the program encourages
ethical hackers security researchers and
other Security Experts to find and
Report vulnerabilities in a company's
systems and software you can showcase
your ability to find vulnerabilities in
the system through multiple interations
