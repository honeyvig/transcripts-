well this is dr. Steven from Team MDS
conquer now I'm going to discuss few
important topics related to the
metabolism of carbohydrates so I'm going
to discuss about glycolysis the first
important point that you need to add is
it's also called as EMP pathway and the
definition says glycolysis can be
defined as a sequence of reactions
converting the glucose or glycogen
either into pyruvate or lactate pyruvate
will be formed in the case of Arabic
reaction in the presence of oxygen and
lactate is formed in the case of
anaerobic reaction in the absence of
oxygen so there are some features that
you have to learn about the light
Hollis's chandu this reaction takes
place in the cells of the body and the
enzymes that are really required for
this are present in cytosol the second
point is glycolysis can occur either in
the presence of oxygen or in the absence
of oxygen in the presence of oxygen it
is called as aerobic reaction and in the
absence of oxygen it is called as
anaerobic reaction so in the arabic
reaction it results in the formation of
pyruvate in the anaerobic reaction it
results in the form of latter third
important point glycolysis is a major
pathway for production of ATP in tissues
lacking mitochondria regularly
mitochondria is the one that is
responsible for the production of ATP
and it is called as powerhouse of cell
but there are few cells where the
mitochondria is lagging in which
glycolysis is the major pathway by which
they generate energy they are
Etra sites cornea and the lenses point
number four glycolysis is a very
essential for brain which depends upon
locus further energy so brain the main
important mechanism by which it get
energy is glycolysis and the next
important point to be added the fifth
important point is the reversal of
glycolysis along with the alternative
arrangement of irreversible steps will
resulting in the synthesis of glucose
that is nothing but gluconeogenesis
means
glycolysis is nothing but it's a
reversal of gluconeogenesis with the
arrangement of irreversible steps we'll
learn about what are reversible steps
and water irreversible steps but if you
provide an alteration for reversible
steps that like Hollis's process can be
reversed and the reverse process of
glycolysis is called as like on your
genesis i hope you are clear until wrong
now we are going to learn about the
individual reactions so basically the
reactions can be categorized into one
that is energy investment means where
you how to invest the energy it is also
called as priming stays or also called
as
preparatory stirrers where Energy's
utilized invested the second stage is
called as splitting phase and the third
stage is called as energy generation
phase also called as payoff phase so
coming to the first one first one is
energy investing also called as priming
stage also called as preparatory phase
so what happens in this ok so there are
three major steps which are cuts in this
one is the initial product already known
already discussed that the initial
product for this is glucose so glucose
initially is going to convert into
glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of
either XO kinase or glucokinase engine
this already discussed this is an energy
investing phase where an energy use used
what is the energy ATP is used and the
byproduct is adp and in the presence of
magnesium ion what is generated glucose
6-phosphate so as already discussed you
can see this is an irreversible step
okay this is an irreversible step the
points to be added about this is so
these hexokinase are glucokinase both of
these are isomers
okay these are isoenzymes so what is the
advantage of exogenous like hexokinase
is present in all the tissues and it
helps in catalyzing or helps in the
reaction of hexoses like so kindness
helps in the reaction of hexoses the
hexoses can be fructose or mannose or
anything
and the hexa- has low km value the
valley is somewhere around 0.1 milli
modes and this hexokinase is inhibited
by this hexokinase is inhibited by the
glucose-6-phosphatase means whenever
this glucose-6-phosphatase increases
okay
the exo kinase activity will be
inhibited coming to the second part that
is glucokinase so glucokinase is mainly
present in the liver whereas hexokinase
is present in all the tissues
glucokinase mainly acts on glucose
whereas hexa kinase can act on all
hexoses the km value of glucokinase is
more and the valley is 10 millimoles
whereas the km value of hexokinase is
low km value and the glucokinase is not
inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate whereas
your hexokinase is inhibited by
glucose-6-phosphate so these are the
important things that you have to make a
note so what is the advantage of having
low km value so whenever you have a low
km value which means that it has high
affinity so as we already discussed that
hexa kinase has low km value means which
has high affinity means which can
utilize the glucose or which can utilize
the hexoses even when they are at very
low concentration whereas Vanille coming
and talking
Luco kindness we're talking about gluco
kindness glucokinase acts only at higher
concentration because it's km values
high means preferably gluco kindness
will come into action immediately after
the meal where the glucose levels will
be more but hexokinase can act even at
lower levels because of its low km value
and high affinity I hope you are clear
with the first step which is a very very
very very important step why you can ask
me why you it's important because the
end product of the first step is glucose
6-phosphate it is a center molecule for
many metabolic reactions like glycolysis
glycol Genesis like on your Genesis
pentose phosphate pathway all these
cycles or all these pathways they have
this as a prime molecule so glucose
6-phosphate has lots of importance so we
are done with the first step now moving
towards the second step so what happens
in the second step glucose 6-phosphate
is now going to convert into fructose
6-phosphate means it is changing glucose
is changing into fructose and this
reaction is mediated by an engine called
as phosphor hexa isomers the enzyme is
phosphor hexose isomers
I hope you're clear this is an isomerase
engine okay so we are done but make sure
this reaction is a reversible reaction
this is a reversible reaction whereas
the previous reaction is an irreversible
reaction so we are done with the second
step so now moving towards the third
step where the fronto 6 phosphate is now
going to convert it into fructose 1
comma 6 this phosphate in the presence
of an enzyme called as phosphor Frato
kindness and even in this step there is
utilization of energy
ok phosphofructokinase utilizes energy
where and ATP is used in the presence of
magnesium to generate ATP so I hope you
are clear with the first three steps the
three steps are called as what are they
called as they're called as energy
investment means you are using some
energy what where you are using first
Lucas is going to convert it into
glucose 6-phosphate
by using one ATP molecule in the
presence of hexa- or glucagon is make a
notable difference between hexokinase
and glucokinase then glucose 6-phosphate
is going to convert it into fructose
6-phosphate in the presence of an enzyme
called s phosphoric so isomerase then
fructose 6-phosphate is going to convert
it into fructose 1 comma 6 bisphosphate
in the presence of phosphofructokinase
by utilizing one more ATP and this
reaction is irreversible and this
reaction is irreversible this reaction
is reversible so we are done with the
first three steps which are called as
energy investment steps where you can
see in two steps out of three we are
investing energy we are investing the
ATP molecule so the second phase is
called as splitting phase means you are
going to split something what you are
going to split
this fructose 1 comma 6 bisphosphate is
going to break into two parts in the
presence of an enzyme called s Alice
it's going to break into dye hydroxy
acetone phosphate and other molecule is
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate so factors 1
comma 6 phosphate is going to split in
the presence of split so that is the
reason why it is called a split phase it
split into two molecules one molecule is
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and second
molecule is Disraeli had 3 phosphate in
the presence of a yellow Center so this
is called as splitting phase clear now
what is going to happen now now
dihydroxy dihydroxyacetone is going to
convert into it's going to convert into
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the
presence of fast for triose isomers so
previously we have one molecule of
previously we have one molecule of
glucose glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate now
we have another molecule so now we have
two molecules because this even this is
going to convert it into so we have two
molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
for now ok so with this we are done with
splitting phase also we are done with
energy investing phase with 3 reactions
we are done with the splitting face with
two reactions and the end product of
splitting phase is two molecules of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from one
molecule of glucose we have initially
started our journey with one molecule of
glucose now the unproductive splitting
phases
two molecules of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate
so now what's going to happen so we are
done with investment we are done with
splitting we are done now the end
product is energy generation okay so
this is how your preparation will be I
can just compare these phases with your
preparation the first phase is investing
phase invest your time invest your
hardwork and everything the second phase
is splitting and reading divide and
divide and revision and the last phase
is energy generation means success phase
so once you're done with the exam and
everything the next half will be the
successful so now the phase is energy
generation phase so what we are left
with we are left with two molecules of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate okay so what
is going to happen so first initially so
this glycerol had three phosphate is
going to convert into 1 comma 3 it's
going to convert into 1 comma 3
this forceful lizard in the presence of
an enzyme called as glycerol head 3
phosphate d hydrogenous so in the
presence of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase 3 glyceraldehyde phosphate
is going to convert into 1 comma 3
bisphosphoglycerate in which in which
and a b h+ h+ is generated i hope you
are clear with this concept okay so we
have started our sixth reaction this is
a sixth reaction where the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
is going to convert is going to help in
converting the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate to 1 comma 3
bisphosphoglycerate and this step is
important as it is involved in the
production of NADPH plis a high energy
compound that is 1 comma 3
bisphosphoglycerate and of course this
NADPH passes through electron
transportation chain and helps in
generation of ATP which will be learned
so this is one of the oxidative
phosphorylation level next one so this
is going to convert into the next level
so we are done with this sixth reaction
now we are going with the seventh
reaction the seventh reaction is nothing
but conversion of 1 comma 3
bisphosphoglycerate 2
3-phosphoglycerate in the presence of
phosphoglycerate kinase phosphorylates
and this is a place where there is
generation of until now we have utilize
the ADP and this is a phase where ATP is
generated and this level is called as
substrate level phosphorylation so the
very unique properties of this seventh
phase
the seventh reaction is this is called
as substrate level phosphorylation and
this is the only kinase enzyme which is
reversible generally if you see go back
and just have a look about your
kindnesses okay
this is a first kinase which is an
irreversible reaction this is another
kinase which is an irreversible reaction
and this is the third kinase enzyme but
it's a reversible reaction make a node
make a node this is the phosphoglycerate
kinase is the only kinase which is the
reversible reaction and this reaction is
a reaction where there is generation of
ATP for the first time and this reaction
is called as substrate level
phosphorylation so right now you have 3
phosphoglycerate in your hand which is
going to convert into 2-phosphoglycerate
in the presence of an enzyme called as
Mutis that is phosphoglycerate mutase
then this 2-phosphoglycerate
is going to convert into phosphoenol
pyruvate in the enzyme called as in
Alice okay so this is very important for
dentistry because this is an enzyme
which is activated or which is sorry
which is inhibited by fluoride so when
you use fluoride when you act add
fluoride so what is going to happen is
the florida is going to form complexes
with this magnesium and it's going to
inhibit or decrease the magnesium levels
by which it's going to inhibit the
analyze enzyme and by which it's going
to decrease the production of ATP for
the bacteria by which decreases the
battery bacterial count and this is the
same reaction or this is the same
mechanism by which the exact lucas level
values of an a patient can be determined
in blood banks okay I hope you're clear
about this so we are done so we got
phosphoenolpyruvate so far so phenol
pirouette is going to convert it into
is going to convert into pie revenge
where there will be generation of again
an ADB okay so the enzyme pyruvate
kinase is the one which helps in that
catalysis of this and this is again
generation of ATP called as substrate
level phosphorylation so here we have
two substrate level phosphorylation one
is this one this is the this is the one
substrate level phosphorylation and the
second substrate level phosphorylation
is this so you have two substrate level
phosphorylation by which the pyruvate is
generated at the end this pyruvate
generation is called as aerobic
method there is other method called as
in the options of oxygen that is
anaerobic where there will be production
of lactic hope everything is clear
as of now okay the next thing to be
added is about how to count how to count
the number of ATP that are generated so
now I am going to discuss about the
recent modification according to the
recent modifications I'm going to talk
ok there few textbooks or few I am
secure book still going with the old
method and whatever method I am talking
this recent one and it is according to
the fifth edition of such an error which
is the latest biochemistry book
available in the market now so coming to
dry colleges so in glycolysis you have a
step where you are going to have an ADP
that this is the one but what is going
to happen as you have two molecules
you'll have two of this so you have two
and a B H you have two NADH so according
to the recent modification one NADH is
going to give rise to two point five ATP
so two NADH is going to give five ATP
hope yours here and the next one you
have to substrate level phosphorylation
where you are generating the ATP right
one is one is this where you have an ATP
but we are talking about two molecules
because we have two molecules of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate so we will
get two ATP so here five now it's two
now it's seven again in the last step
you how to more ATP so you have totally
nine ATP are generated of which
we are just counting the ATP which are
generated in the generation phase but
during the investment phase we have used
280 C here we have used 1 ATP here we
have used 1 ATP here totally we got 9
minus 2 so it is 782 I hope you are very
clear about the number of ATP generated
during the or the net number of ATP
generated nine minus two so the net ATP
generated in the dialysis in the arabic
is 780 B I hope you are very clear about
this and for example when I'd like
wallace's occurs from glycogen here the
glycolysis occurred from glucose for
example if it is occurring from glycogen
one more extra ATP is generated why one
more extra tip is generated because
there is no need of this conversion
because there is no need of utilization
of the first ATP which is just used to
activate Luca 6 phosphate glucose to
glucose-6-phosphate so there will be
addition of one more ATP thus in
anaerobic glycolysis 3 ATP are generated
from glycogen that is more advantageous
when compared with the loopers I hope
you're very clear about this and few
more application things that to be added
is about the cancer cells and the
glycolysis the cancer cells
cancer is uncontrolled division of cells
right the simple simple basic definition
the cancer cells displace and increasing
an update of glucose and there will be
increasing in activity of glycolysis as
the tumor grows rapidly the blood
vessels are unable to have adequate
oxygen so the tumor grows very rapidly
the oxygen levels to the blood will drop
down and lead to hypoxia so what is
going to happen the aerobic cycle is
going to convert it into an aerobic
cycle and this hypoxic inducible
transforming factor is a factor which is
present in these cells will activate and
increase the synthesis of the enzymes
that are responsible for glycolysis as
well as the helps in transportation of
glucose however the cancer cells cannot
grow and survive without proper
vacillation one of the modality of the
cancer treatment is to use a drugs that
is going to inhibit the vascular supply
to the children by which the cancer can
be cured so apart from this you can make
a note about the irreversible steps in
glycolysis we have already learned ok
first if you see the first phase that is
the energy investment phase there to
irreversible one is
so one is your kindness HECO kindness or
glucokinase who is the first
irreversible step and the second one is
phosphofructokinase is a second
irreversible step and going to the last
one that is this is the pyruvate kinase
is the third irreversible steps so the
easy way to remember all irreversible
steps in glycolysis are kinase there are
four kinase out of which one is a
reversible kinase we have learned that
pgk is a reversible kinase you can
exclude that and rest all are
irreversible steps and the basic
difference between the glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis is just the irreversible
steps so you need a means it's going to
be reversal reversing it's going to be
the reversal so you need to give an
additional and James for all the
irreversible steps means all the kinda
all the three irreversible steps you
need to have an alternative so that with
that alternate the entire process can be
reversed so for example if you if you
are planning to go back pyruvate to this
one this is a single directional
reaction so you need an extra and gem
for it and from here to here is it is a
reversible it will go back here to here
is a reversible it will go back here to
here this is the only kindness which is
a reversal it will go back this this
will go back this is the reversible
reaction it will go back it will go back
here we need an exchanger because it is
an irreversible reaction it will go back
because it's a reversible reaction it
will not go we need provide an extra
cell so that's just an alternation of
the irreversible reactions will make the
cycle reverse and that reverse cycle is
called as gluco neo Genesis Dan for now
we'll be coming with few more videos to
help you out
the only thing that we can follow now is
the simple principle try to be positive
learn as much as you can okay so
biochemistry is something called as dry
topic but if you take the rough analysis
of need exam or any other exam into
consideration biochemistry carry half of
the weight is of a regular subject means
it's going to carry seven months so
these are suckers are going to carry 14
similar to that of aims clinicals will
carry more marks and coming to
comparison with the clinical
biochemistry is going to carry less than
50 percentage of marks compared to any
other set for example if you're taking
Arthas is subject so if you just compare
the matrix of ortho to that of the
biochemistry either in the aims or in
the need biochemistry is going to carry
less than 50 percentage of marks when
compared with ortho so don't get panic
the only suggestion what I can give you
this just try to be the best whatever it
is whether it's biochemistry or ortho
try to be the best learn as much as you
can try to be positive okay don't divide
or analyze the subjects basing upon
their weight is but now you are in a
face what face already discussed you are
in an mg investing phase in must as much
as time as possible as much as energy as
possible as much as hard work as
possible then you will have a great
return similarly like your glycolysis
where your energy generation phase will
be there we're going to generate
something great with whatever you are
investing now thank you for now signing
