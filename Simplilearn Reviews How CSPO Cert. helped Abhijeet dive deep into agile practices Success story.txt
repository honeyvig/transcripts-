certificates are good to take but don't
just have it for the sake of a
certificate or a piece of paper in your
portfolio what matters most is how we
integrate those valuables those
learnings those insights in our
day-to-day life I did my CSM
certification and cspo certification
from Simply learn and it changed the
Outlook of how I approach work hi I'm
AIT RI and this is my story
[Music]
I'm having around over 9 years of
experience into Mobile domen of within
the span of time I got opportunities to
work across different verticals with
different Big T Giants and help the
teams to create some highly scalable and
reliable applications which serves a
used consumer base I also completed CSM
certification and cspo certification
from Simply learned which gave me a lot
of insights on how we approach the
projects and how we handle themes and
how we Implement agile practices I have
been practicing aile for past 7 to 8
years and and I have been doing very
well I have I'm very well versed with
that but gradually I understood that at
times it's needed to validate what we
learned what we know and how are we
implementing it that validation is also
becomes becomes very crucial very
critical at times because that's how we
understand that if we are practicing the
right fundamentals or or not so the
pursuing those certifications really
helped me a lot and validate my
knowledge and my skills and that has
also contributed in the way that I was
approaching different agile practices
completing CSM and cspo certifications
helps in collaborating better with the
teams those collaborations are much
needed when we are working with larger
teams and how we are handling them
certifications are important but most
important is the learning that we get
through the certification process like
what we Implement those learnings in our
day-to-day life then eventually that
results in good

output I was exploring opportunities and
options uh that can help me with CSM and
csq certification I found that simply
learn very well maintains their website
has a lot of courses to offer so it
itself validates its existence the
executives from Simply learn who
connected with me helped me with clear
guidelines the expectations the process
and how we can complete it most
importantly the learning that I could
expect after completing the
certification so that actually instilled
my belief in the in this platform and
henceforth I moved ahead and continued
with my courses with simply learn well
if I talk about CSM certification that
through the certification process I dive
deep into the agile practices how we
collaborate within the team and how we
focus as a team to achieve Sprint
Milestones as we grow in the hierarchy
as we grow within the organization team
collaboration becomes very important and
at the same time having a vision for the
product becomes more crucial and the
best part about my being involved in the
training process that I was
proactive in discussions in debates in
evaluating analyzing case stud
so in within the entire training process
I think I enjoyed the entire flow and by
the virtue of which by end of the
training program I got a lot of insights
that how a product Vision needs to be
seen how we create the backlogs how we
see and
organize different teams and its
attributes so as to achieve the product
uh Vision definitely it had made a lot
of notable contributions and notable
differences in my current work Style and
the way I have been contributing to my
practices and into my teams both the
certifications helped me understand that
how a team collaboration is more
important than being an individual
contributor apart from that I also
developed a mindset to analyze product
Vision uh apart from my technical
engagements and professional commitments
I I like traveling I like exploring
different cuins and when I'm at at home
I like studying books at times I go for
swimming playing some board games chase
I'm an outdoor sports player as well
like Cricket football soccer so yeah
these kind of uh activities helps me
relax a bit refreshing a bit I believe
in the changing business Dynamics
staying relevant in the market is very
crucial for that we need to always stay
open-minded open to upscaling open to
challenges
open to learnings and open to continuous
Improvement
