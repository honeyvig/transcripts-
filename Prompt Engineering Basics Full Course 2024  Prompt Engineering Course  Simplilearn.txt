to this amazing video on prompt
engineering by simpl it was November 30
2022 Sam Alman Greg Brockman and ilas
AER would never have thought that with
the push off a button they would
completely alter the lives of all human
beings living on the earth and of future
generations to come
on November 30 the open AI team launched
Chad GPT Chad GPT was born that day Alit
a very small event in the history of
Internet Evolution but one that can no
less be marked as one of the most
significant events of modern IT industry
chat GPT a text based chatbot that gives
replies to questions asked to it is
built on GPT large language model but
what was so different I mean the Google
search engine YouTube Firefox browser
they all have been doing the same for
decades so how is Chad GPT any different
and why is it such a big deal well for
starters Chad GPT was not returning
index websites that have been SEO tuned
and optimized to rank at the top chat
GPT was able to comprehend the nature
tone and the intent of the query asked
and generated text based responses based
on the questions asked it was like
talking to a chat bot on the internet
minus the out of context responses with
the knowledge of 1 7 trillion parameters
it was no shock that a Computing system
as efficient and prompt test CH gbt
would have its own set BS so did Chad G
it was bound by the parameters of the
language model it was trained on and it
was limited to giving outdated results
since the last training data was from
September still chj made Wales in the
tech community and continues to do so
just have a look at the Google Trend
search on Chad GP every day new content
is being published on Chad GPT and and
hundreds of AI tools the sheer interest
that individuals and Enterprises across
the globe has shown in chat GPT and AI
tools is immense ai ai ai ai generative
AI generative AI generative ai ai ai ai
ai ai a a now here comes the fun part
chj or for that matter any large
language model runs on neural networks
trained on multi-million billion and
even trillions of data parameters these
chatbots generate responses to user
queries based on the input given to it
while it may generate similar responses
for identical or similar queries it can
also produce different responses based
on the specific context phrasing and the
quality of input provided by each user
additionally chat GPT is designed to
adapt its language and tone to match the
style and preferences of each user so
its responses may varry in wording and
tone depending on the individual users
communication style and preferences
every user has their own unique style of
writing and communication and chat gut's
response can worry based on the input
given to it so this is where prompt
Engineers come into prompt Engineers are
expert at prompt engineering sounds like
a cyclic definition right well let's
break it down first let's understand
what prompts are so prompts are any text
based input given to the model as a
query this includes statements like
questions asked the tone mentioned in
the query the context given for the
query and the format of output expected
so here is a quick example for your
understanding now that we have discussed
what a prompt is so let us now
understand who is a prompt engineer and
why it has become the job for the future
broadly speaking a prompt engineer is a
professional who is capable of drafting
queries or prompts in such a way that
large language models like GPT Palm
llama Bloom etra can generate the
response that is expected these
professionals are skilled at crafting
accurate and context ual prompts which
in turn allows the model to generate
desired results so here's a quick
example for you prompt Engineers are
experts not only at the linguistic front
but they also had extensive domain
knowledge and very well versed with the
functioning of neural networks and
natural language processing along with
the knowledge of scripting languages and
data analysis leading job platforms like
indeed and Linkedin already have many
prompt engineer positions in the United
States alone job postings for this role
running in the thousands reflecting the
growing demand the salary of prompt
Engineers is also compelling with a
range that spend from $50,000 to over
$150,000 per year depending on
experience and specialization so there
are multiple technical Concepts that a
prompt engineer must be well wored in to
be successful in their jobs such as
multimodality tokens weights parameters
Transformers to name a few whether it's
Healthcare defense IT services or attech
industry IND the need for skill prompt
Engineers is on the rise there are
already several thousand job openings in
this field and the demand will continue
to
go so let's start with the first prompt
and we name it as text condensation and
refinement so in this text condensation
is a critical skill that is used in
natural language processing and serving
as a broad spectrum of domains among the
most exciting applications for language
models is their ability to dis complex
models and complex articles and Concepts
into brief easy to understand summaries
let's dive into an enhanced text
condensation exercise using prompts
suppose you are curious about the role
of antioxidants in the body you might
craft a prompt like this that I will
write summarize the role of
antioxidants so now let's see
what our chgb gives us the
output so you can see that the chat gbd
has completed its response and like to
refine this information further you
might instruct the chat jpd or your
model to encapsulate the essence in a
shorter format so for that you can write
a prompt that use the above context and
summarize this into some 100 words or
some 200 words or just condense this
into a brief
explanation so we will do that
so now you can see that the chat GPT has
taken our query or the prompt and it has
condense the above content into brief
explanation so accordingly you could use
different prompts and now we'll move to
delay and we'll generate a image and
here we'll like we'll use the condense
format only to give a prompt to Del so
we'll write generate a highly detailed
image of a futuristic city uh and we can
specify what time of day we want that at
dusk and featuring towering skyscrapers
with glowing windows or flying cars and
a sky filled with neon colored clouds so
we can give the prompt or generate
prompt like that only so we will write
the prompt for
that that is detail
image of a
futuristic city and here we'll specify
the time for the day uh that would be at
dusk and
featuring towering
skyscrapers with glowing Windows flying
cars and what you need to specify you
could blue that
so let's see what D respond to us and
you could see that it's repeat you could
see that Dal is creating image now with
the prompt we
entered and this is the response so it
has given us that here are the images of
the futuristic city at dusk featuring
towering skyscrapers with glowing
Windows flying cars and a sky filled
with neon colored clouds you could see
the picture here so similarly you can
give prompts to DAL or any other AI tool
and you can get the output as expected
and you can iterate your prompts
according to the ai's capabilities and
now moving back to chat jpt so here we
will come to another type of prompt that
is information synthesis and retrieval
so these language models Excel not only
in language generation but also in
extracting and synthesizing information
from text so we will consider this
prompt that is designed to pull specific
details from a given narrative so we
will ask it that researchers often use
various tools including llms like open a
GPT in the studies so I have a prompt
return we'll use that and let's see what
chat
jpt gives the response for this
prompt so you could see here that
researchers often use various AI tools
including llms like open a GPT in the
studies of transparent disclosure of
these tools helps maintain Integrity in
specific publication so it's important
for authors to disclose the context and
extent of AI assistants in the research
and journals should be upfront about
their AI usage in the review process so
identify the specific llm that is large
language model mentioned in the text so
let's see if he can
guess so you could see that chat jbt has
given the response that the specific
language model llm mentioned in the text
is open a gbd
so so this was about the prompt
information synthesis and retrieval now
moving to the next prompt so our next
prompt here is enhanced query response
so optimizing how models respond to
queries involves crafting more intricate
prompts that guide the AI to deliver
precise and useful answers so for this
we'll write a prompt that would be
provide an answer based on the context
given so be sent and clear if uncertain
respond with cannot confirm so we'll
write the prompt for this and I have
written the prompt earlier so I'll show
you guys this is the prompt and we'll
ask J J about the enhanced query
response so we have pasted The Prompt
here and our prompt is provide an answer
based on the context given that is B
sent and clear if uncertain provide with
cannot confirm so our prompt is here the
Innovative drug ala was developed as a
result of collaborative efforts between
several biotech firms so this drug aimed
at treating autoimmune disorder
represent a significant breakthrough in
biom medicine so we'll ask the
chatut the question what is the purpose
of Alum so let's see what it respond to
us so you could see that the CH jpt has
responded the purpose of Aluma is to
treat autoimmune disorders so this is
the type of prompt that is named as
enhanced query response so it optimizes
how models respond to queries involve
crafting more intricate prompts that
guide the AI to deliver precise and
useful answers so now we'll move to the
next type of prompt that is Advanced
text categorization so to handle more
complex task combining detailed
instructions with context and examples
can significantly enhance the model's
performance so here we will write the
prompt to assess the sentiment of the
following statements so we'll write some
statements and ask a chat GPD or AI
model to assess them and classify them
as negative positive or neutral so let's
see we will write a prompt
here assess the
sentiment of the following
statement as
positive
negative or
neutral and after this we will provide a
statement to chat jpd
so our statement would
be the
movies stunning visuals or Shadow its
weak story
line so let's see how CH GT classifies
this statement as positive negative or
neutral
so you could see that the chat jity has
generated its response and it stated
that the sentiment of this statement the
mov is stunning visuals or Shadow it
weak storyline is mixed it acknowledges
a positive aspect that is stunning
visuals and a negative one weak
storyline so you could see here that the
chat jpd can be used for sentiment
analysis so you could provide statements
and ask chat jpt whether it's positive
neutral or negative now moving to the
next prompt so our next prompt is
dynamic conversations so creating
conversational systems that adapt to
various tones and complexities is a
fascinating application of prompt
engineering so here's how you might
design a system to provide simplified
friendly response so for this we'll
write a prompt and let's see what your
AI model and our CH jbt will give a
response so this is a
conversation so here we'll write a
prompt and start a conversation with our
AI model so first we'll write hi there
what's your role so let's see what it
responds so as our AI model chat gbt it
states that hello my role is to assist
you by providing information answering
questions and helping with a wide range
of task how can I assist you today so
you can continue the conversation here
and we'll continue and ask him whether
you know
about
photosynthesis if
yes kindly explain it to
me so you could see that our CHT has
started generating the response and it
has stated that yes I can explain
photosynthesis and it's a process used
by plants that gain certain bacteria to
convert light energy usually from the
Sun into chemical energy
repeat usually from the Sun into
chemical energy and it is giving us some
examples you could go through that and
you can continue your conversation with
your AI model so this is the another
kind of prompt now we'll move to the
next prompt type that is the Innovative
Corde generation so depending on the
potential of llms that is large language
models in code generation let's explore
a more intricate example that is we'll
ask them to write a code for us so we'll
write a prompt that would be write a
python function that calculates the
factorial of a number and prints the
result so let's see what our CH jbt will
respond to this
so you could see that chat jpt is
showing analyzing so it's analyzing a
statement and after that it will start
generating the code for
us and you could see
that it has generated the code and it
has the prompts or the statements that
explain the code itself so if you want
this code AS understandable you could
ask the chat J to explain it line by
line and you could see that the chat jbt
has done the task for you
so you could see that it has completed
its response and it has explained each
line of the code with all the necessity
Concepts so moving now so these enhanced
prompts and examples showcase how
versatile and Powerful language models
can be and within well structured and
throughout instructions as we continue
to explore and experiment with these
prompts the potential for creating
sophisticated nuanced and highly
functional air driven applications
become increasingly
evident so here we will discuss the
components of a well structured prompt
along with their explanations and
examples so let's see there are six
types of components number one is fext
so this sets the scene or provide
background information necessary for
understanding The Prompt so let's see an
example and that to in charge only so
the example could be that in a world
where artificial intelligence has
replaced most jobs describe a day in the
life of a human worker so this gives the
context if you want we can type The
Prompt also that is in a world where AI
has replaced more jobs describe a day in
the life of a human
worker so this is the example of the
context so we are giving the context
that in a world where artificially
intelligence has replaced most jobs so
describe a day in the life of a human
worker so we have given the context and
ask him the result for that so this is
how it's done so we won't see the result
we'll get back here and the next
component is Task so the specific action
or question that the responder needs to
address that is the task and the example
could
be so let's say an example in the J gbt
only we'll stop this this prompt and
write the example of the task so we can
write the task example that could be
write an essay on the effects of global
warming on agriculture so you could just
ask him for an task so write an essay so
this is a task that we are asking the
chat GPT or any llm so after this we
will combine all these components and I
will show you how you can write the
perfect prompt so that you could get the
better response from the llms that could
be jat gbt or go part so let's write
here write an essay we'll just write on
the effects of global warming so this is
the task that we are assigning to chat
jpd okay so we are not interested in the
response so we'll get back here and
let's see the third component that is
Persona so that specifies the Identity
or role the responder should assume
while answering so it should be
considered for the llm that it could be
a data scientist or we just ask him that
as a medical professional or act as a
data scientist or advise a patient on
managing type two diabetes without
medication so this is how we could ask
chat GPT so for the Persona purpose
we'll write an example that as a medical
professional adviser patient on managing
type two diabetes okay so this is the
Persona that we have asked him to be a
medical IAL
professional now moving to the next
component that is format that defines
how the response should be structured or
presented let's see an example so we
will ask him to list five tips for
improving personal productivity in
bullet points so in bullet points that's
the format we want from the charity so
list global warming points global
warming points as bullet points so this
is the format we want we'll wait for the
response so you could see that it has
started providing in the bullet points
so moving back the next is exampler so
sometimes a sample answer or part of an
answer is given to illustrate the
expected style or content so for example
we could ask chj that like in the
example the protagonist overcomes fear
write a story about overcoming a
personal challenge so you can give these
type of examples or if you're WR getting
prompt to any specific region you can
give the example for that also okay now
moving to the next one that is tone so
that indicates the mood or attitude the
responder should convey so you could ask
any llm that write a humorous blog post
about the trials of parenting toddlers
so you could ask the tone also if you
want we can ask J here that wrer
humerous I don't know if the spelling is
correct or not but
yeah blog post about the
trials of parenting
tolers so he will guide you in a
humerous way only and provide the
response so with the right technique you
can craft prompts that are not only
precise but also versatile suitable for
any learning management system so this
approach ensures that your promts will
engage students encourage critical
thinking and meaningful discussions no
matter what the platform you use whether
it could be CH gbt or B so you could
Embrace these Technologies or components
of the prompt and write your prompt very
precisely so you could see that he is
writing a blog post in a humorous Stone
so let's pause this and see an example
that contains most of the components
okay so we'll start with that that would
be nutritionist so we will ask so as a
nutritionist speaking at a high
school and like we can write speaking at
a high school career day so create a
presentation outlining the importance of
healthy eating habits for teenagers and
use a friendly and engaging tone and
include real life success stories to
illustrate your points so there will be
context task Persona format and example
and we will set the tone also so we'll
write the prompt at a high school career
day so create a presentation or create a
draft for presentation as it can't
directly create the presentation so
we'll ask him presentation outlining the
importance of healthy eating
habits so healthy eating habits for
teenagers you are specifying that
also okay and here we'll set the tone
that a user friendly tone and that could
be friendly and engaging tone and
include real life success
stories to illustrate your
points okay so here context is high
school career day we have given the
context and the task is create a
presentation on healthy eating habits
and the Persona we have given is neist
that Char will act as and the format is
presentation with real life stories
that's the format we have given to him
and then we have given the example of
real life success stories and the tone
we have asked is friendly and engaging
similarly we can write other prompts so
as you could see that the chity has
started drafting the response and after
that you can Rectify your response and
that could be in on liners also so we
won't go into that we will write another
prompt so that you guys can get a clear
idea so here we'll start with another
prompt that would be imagine you are a
Sci-Fi author writing we will ask the
chat Jey that you are a Sci-Fi author
and writing a short
story okay and we can ask him set in a
future where water is scared like in
scars and here we will ask him to craft
a narrative that explores the daily
challenges and faced by a family using a
dramatic and suspenseful tone okay daily
challenges faced by a family using and
dramatic and
suspenseful so if I tell you about this
prompt so the context is future world
with water scarcity and the task is
write a short story and the Persona we
have set here is sci-fi auor and the
format is narrative and example we have
given here is the daily challenge of a
family and the tone we have asked him to
set his dramatic and suspense similarly
we can ask JJ the prompts that is as a
financial adviser prepare a guide for
young adults on managing finances after
college and use a conversational tone
include actionable steps and start with
the story of a recent graduate to
illustrate common Financial pitfalls so
here the context could be financial
management post college and the task is
to prepare a financial guide and the
Persona is financial advisor the format
is guide with actionable steps and the
example is story of a recent graduate
and the tone is conversational so
similarly you can write prompts and
generate more prompts that could be more
effective for the llms and you could use
these methods or these components to
generate a well structured
PR so let's first understand what is
prom tuning so promp tuning is a method
that enhances the adaptability of large
language models for Noel task by fine-
tuning a minimal set of prompt
parameters this technique involves
appending a tailored prompt before the
input text directing the llm to generate
outputs aligned with specific objectives
its efficiency and versatility have made
it a local or focal point in natural
language processing advancements so
let's understand prom tuning so prom
tuning is the practice of customer izing
llms for new applications by adjusting a
limited subset of parameters known as
prompts so these prompts placed before
the input navigate the llm toward
producing the intended output and now we
talk about the advantages of prompt
tuning so the number one comes is
efficiency so unlike comprehensive Model
F tuning prom tuning modifies only a
select few parameters enabling quicker
task specific model adjustment and then
comes the versatility so this approach
is applicable across a spectrum of task
from text generation and Analysis in
natural language processing to image
recognition and automated coding
showcasing its adaptability to different
domains and then comes the
interpretability The modifiable Prompt
parameters allow for an examination of
how the model's output generation is
influenced offering insights into the
models processing so this was about the
advantages of prompt tuning now we'll
move to the key challenges is prompt
tuning and we will write some prompts
and see how we can promp tune the Chad
JP model and we can generate the outputs
we want so let's move to chat jpt and
here first we'll draft or craft
effective prompts so crafting prompts
that effectively guide the model without
being overly complex is challenging So
to avoid them we will write some prompts
and let's see so we will take a fresh
example for crafting precise prompts so
let's consider a scenario and consider
you are part of a financial analysis
firm specializing in renewable energy
sectors like solar and wind power you
aim to leverage a language model for
extracting market trends investment
opportunities and Regulatory impacts
specific to these sectors however you
wish to exclude General energy Market
data or information about fossil fuels
and non-renewable sources as well as
omit any direct mentions of rival firms
or their invest M products so what
challenge you will face here is your
objective is to direct the AI model to
furnish targeted insights on renewable
energy sectors while filtering out
nonrelevant information and avoiding any
specific mentions of competitors and
their offerings so for example uh we can
write a prompt that give me all details
on renewable energy sectors including
solar and wind power but skip all info
on other energy types and ignore data
about companies like you could name the
companies like Eco power Ventures and
their solar boost investment fund so
this is the ineffective prompt so this
prompt is ineffective because it's
overly detailed and instructs the model
on what to exclude in a way that could
be confusing potentially leading to an
over focus on the exclusions rather than
the desired content so we talk about the
optimized prompt what you can write is
provide an analysis of current trend
investment opportunities and the impact
of regulations in the renewable energy
sectors specifically focusing on solar
and wind power exclude General energy
market trends and specific investment
products so this refine prompt clearly
directs the model towards the needed
information that is market trends
opportunities and Regulatory impacts
within solar and wind energy without
cluttering the request with too many
exclusions it certainly implies the need
for EXP exclusively by focusing on
specifically focusing which naturally
guides the AI to a unrelated sectors and
competitive products facilitating a more
focused and relevant output so now let's
see this example and this is the
inefficient prompt so we'll copy this
and paste it to chat jpt and let's see
what output it will provide to us
so you could see that it has provided us
the output but this prompt is
ineffective because it's overly detailed
and instructs the model on what to
exclude in a way that could be confusing
now we'll write the correct prompt as
that is the optimized prompt
what I've told you that is provide an
analysis of current trends investment
and opportunities and the impact of
regulations in the renewable energy
sectors specifically focusing on solar
and wind power and exclude General
energy market trends and specific
investment products so this is the
optimized pump and it will provide a
good result and a good
output so you could see that it has
started with the current trends
only e
you could see the output and this is the
desired output what we need and the chat
J has proed with the optimized form Now
we move to the next challenge that is
avoiding overfitting so there's a risk
of the model becoming too specialized to
the training prompts reducing its
ability to generalize so strategy for
this broad application is to prevent
over specialization prompts that should
be designed to be broad enough to
enccompass the range of related queries
enhancing the model's versatility so for
this also we will draft and optimized
and unoptimized prompt so let's think of
a scenario that you are developing an
educational platform that uses a
language model to generate study
materials for high school biology
covering topics from cell biology to
ecology initially you f tune the model
with prompts focused on very specific
areas like phot photosynthesis in plants
so initial point we can write is explain
the process of photosynthesis in Plants
focusing on chlorophylls role and light
absorption so while the model excels at
generating detailed content on
photosynthesis it struggles when asked
about broader or slightly related topics
such as cellular respiration or plant
adoptions to different environments so
the issue we encounter here is when
students query how do plants adapt to
low light conditions so the model will
fail to provide comprehensive answers
because it's been too narrowly trained
on photosynthesis specifics so the
solution for this overfitting challenge
is to prevent or fitting and enhance the
model's ability to journalize Across the
broader subject of biology you should
utilize more inclusive prompts that
cover a range of topics within the field
so we have the Revis prompt here that is
provide an overview of plant biology
including key processes like
photosynthesis cellular respiration and
adaptions to environmental factors so
this broader approach encourages the
model to generate content that's
relevant across various biology topics
improving its utility for educational
purposes so this is the prompt and we'll
ask CH jbt that is provide an overview
of the plant biology including key
processes like photosynthesis cellular
respiration and adaptions to
environmental conditions so this will
improve its utility for educational
purposes
so let's move to the next concern that
would be scalability concern and you
could see that it has provided the
desired output for the photosynthesis
and the environmental factors for plant
biology and as we talk about the
scalability concern so as the training
data volume grows maintaining the
efficiency of prom tuning becomes more
challenging necessitating innovative
solutions to streamline the adaption
process so now we'll talk about its
prompt also so scalability that is
implementing AI for diverse customer
service inquiries so let's consider a
scenario your company aims to deploy an
AI chatboard to handle customer service
inquiries across different departments
from technical support to billing and
account management initially the
chatboard is trained with specific
prompts for each category performing
well in small case test so what
challenge will you face with this prompt
is or with this scenario is as you scale
the chatboard to handle thousands of
inquiries daily across a wide range of
topics you find that the initial
approach of using highly specific
prompts for each each category is
unsustainable so the chat board
struggles to adapt the vast and varied
nature of customer queries and we'll
face the scaling issue also here that is
the specific prompts used during initial
training don't cover the breadth of
potential customer inquiries leading to
inadequate responses in unanticipated
scenarios so what strategy we can apply
for scalability is instead of relying on
narrow specific prompts for each inquiry
type your transition to using broader
more adaptable prompts that can the AI
in understanding and categorizing a wide
range of customer questions so we can
have an adapted prompt example and I
have one that is or we can write here
that would be identify the category of
the customers inquiry that could be
technical billing account management and
provide relevant assistance based on the
identified category so this strategy
allows the chatboard to more effectively
process a variety of inquiries by
understanding the context and
categorizing questions before generating
responses making it more scalable and
versatile in handling customer service
task so if we address prom tuning
challenges it is simplifying complex
proms that is Begin by clearly
identifying the core information or
action desired from the llm breaking
down multifaceted prompts into simpler
more focused request employ
straightforward language and eliminate
non Essential Elements to clarify the
prompt and then we have utilizing soft
soft prompts So Soft prompts which are
non textual signals trained from
examples guide the llm without explicit
worded instructions so these are
particularly used for task with limited
training data or where interpretability
is less critical and then we have
Innovative optimization techniques so
the development of parameter efficient
fine-tuning techniques such as ptuning
optimizes the search for Effective proms
in a continuous space making it feasible
to tailor llms to specific task without
extensive retraining so this was all
about the prom
tuning hello everyone and welcome to the
tutorial on prompt library for all use
cases at simply The Prompt library is a
comprehensive toolkit for mastering myad
use cases with a whether you are delving
into programming honing creative writing
skills or exploring data analysis this
Library offers a versatile array of
prompts tailor to your needs now before
we move on and learn more about it I
requ EST you guys that do not forget to
hit the Subscribe button and click the
Bell icon now here's the agenda for our
today's session so guys we are going to
start with first understanding The
Prompt structure moving ahead we are
going to understand testing and
iterating then we are going to explore
the prompt examples and at the end we
are going to conclude our sessions with
utilizing prompt libraries and resources
so guys in today's video we will be
exploring the promt structure for
various use cases now first let us try
to to understand the problem structure
so guys I'll break down the problem
structure so here first we have the
action verbs so guys think of action
verbs like a boss telling chat GPT what
to do it's like giving chat GPT a job so
for example if I say write you are
telling chat gbt to put words on the
page for example if I say write a story
I'm telling J gbt hey I want to you to
make up a story for me so so this is
something like this now let us ask Chad
GPT hey so write is your action verb all
over here so this is the first prom
structure that I would like you to apply
now the second one you could give a
theme or a topic about now if you say
just write a story chat GPT is going to
give any random story so we won't want
that the next thing that we cover
basically is topic or theme so what
theme or topic you looking about this is
a part where you are giving chat GPT a
subject to talk about imagine you're
telling a friend let's talk about cats
so cats are the given topic so if I say
write about your favorite food I am
telling chat GPT tell me about your
favorite food so you have to always
include a topic or theme along with your
action work so here I can include some
certain thing like this
that write
a
story about
food so you could see all over here chat
GPT has given two uh responses this is
response one and this is response two
now the third thing that comes up all
over here is constraints or
limitations think of constraints as a
rules or boundaries for chat GPT to
follow it's like saying you can talk
about cats but only in three senten
so if I say write a poem in 20 words
it's like I'm telling chat GB make a
short poem using only 20 words so this
is one of the things that you have to
always keep in consideration regarding
what task you want to give so always
include constraints or
limitations fourth one is background or
information context
so so this is also one of the most
important parameters uh what exactly it
means is like this Parts sets the scene
for chgb like giving it a background
story imagine you are telling someone
about a movie before they watch it so if
I say imagine you are on a spaceship I'm
telling Chad GPT pretend like you are
flying through the space so this is also
very very important for you to consider
to give certain idea regarding your
background or
information now the fifth one is
conflict or challenge guys this adds
some spices to the prom it's like a
puzzle for a problem for chat GPT to
solve it's like saying talk about cats
but tell me why some people don't like
them so if I say Char GPT explain why
reading is important but you can't use
the word book I am challenging Char GPT
to be creative so this is where conflict
or challenge you have to give to char
GPT now example let us take one example
on this so for example if I say the
action verb as right we'll highlight
this with red and the topic or theme
could be like your favorite
vacation if I talk about a background or
context like say you are on a
beach with your
friends or conflict or challenge we can
give all over here something like in
just 50 words so guys this is certain
thing to follow while giving a prompt to
chat gbd so in this way putting all
together you could combine all these
three things and form a sentence and
this prompt is going to be very very
effective to solve the problem of
generic
responses now with the simple example
you can see how different components
come together to create engaging prompts
for chat GPD to work with so guys
whenever you are giving a prompt I would
request you to always follow this
structure so it's going to create a map
for you to get a more precise answer now
let's take example and elaborate the
prompt library with examples to make it
more understandable so guys let's take
another example of text classification
so for text classification we'll take
the action verb as classify and our text
type would be product review example
could be classify the following text as
negative positive or neutral
sentiment and after that you could give
like the product
review exceeded
my expectation so if you give certain
thing like this you would say this is a
positive sentence so making your prompts
in this manner with a proper structure
you are going to get a very particular
response with fits what you need so
always remember this structure whenever
you are framing any prom now let's move
to the second part that is testing and
validation guys testing and iterating
are essential steps in refining prompts
and ensuring Optimal Performance from
Chad gbd let us break down this process
the first process is prompt validation
so before using a prompt it's crucial to
test to ensure it that it generates a
desired response accurately then you
evaluate the output you're going to
generate responses using the prompt and
evaluate the quality relevance and
coherence of the output third check for
errors look out for any errors
inconsistencies or unexpected behavior
in the generated responses compare
against expectations compare the
generated responses against your
expectation or any requirements to
verify that they meet your desired
criteria the fifth one is solicit
feedback seek feedback from peers
colleagues or domain experts to validate
the effectiveness of the prom for
example like analyzing the results so
you would say analyze the results to
testing to identify areas of improvement
or refining The Prompt next is modifying
The Prompt based on the analysis make
the adjustment to the prompt Pro
structure next then fine-tune the
parameters experiment with different
variations of the prompt such as
existing constraints changing topics or
refining prompt to assess whether the
changes have resulted in improvements in
the quality of the generated responses
the fourth one is retesting test the
modified prompt again to assess whether
the changes have resulted in
improvements in the quality of the
generated responses or not and the final
step is iterate as needed iterate the
testing and modification process as
needed until you achieve the desired
outcomes and generate high quality
responses consistently so this structure
you have to always follow when you are
iterating so I'll give you an example so
like we have given uh initial prompt as
write a product description for a new
smartphone and I would say include
details about features
specifications and benefits and I would
say add a constant all over here that
keep the response in 100
words so this is your initial prompt
which you are given now for
testing the next comes is testing
generate product descriptions using the
initial prompt evaluate the quality and
relevance of the generat descriptions
check for errors if inconsistencies or
missing information is there compare the
description against the expectations and
requirements so this process comes under
testing Okay so give it uh like change
your prompt a little bit give a specific
uh description regarding a certain
product and you would ask that and just
next process would be evaluate the
quality and the relevance like what you
are uh getting as a response check for
errors like go to Google let see if it's
same is coming up then what's the
customer expectations regarding that
product so if the overall structure is
like technical structure is maintained
so this gives the first phase of testing
next one comes the analysis some
descriptions lack detail and fail to
highlight its key features okay so in
the scenario the descriptions vary in
length and structure leading to kind of
inconsistencies certain descriptions
like here will focus more on technical
specifications than the user benefits so
overall the quality and the coherence of
the descriptions needs Improvement so
you have to take all these parameter and
you have to reframe your prompts okay
then next comes is iteration you have to
modify this prompt to provide like more
ofer to give a clear instructions and
emphasize the user benefits write a
captivating product descriptions for a
new smartphone okay then move to
retesting generate product descriptions
using the modified prompt and for the
outcome you would say that the Revis
prompt should yield more compelling and
informative product desriptions so this
is how you have to do iterate
continuously to get the proper response
like which you would be
okay guys now let's move to the final
part of this video that is utilizing the
prompt libraries guys utilizing prompt
libraries and resources is essential for
streamlining The Prompt writing process
and acts as a wide range of pre-designed
prompts for various use cases so you're
going to get a library of a predefined
prompts okay so there's one website like
which I want to show you this is called
anthropic so anthropic has recently
released a prompt Library so guys they
have given a wide data of a prompt
Library so if you just click on this so
you're going to get like what are the
effective prompts in all these domains
so give it a shot uh try to see what are
the uh like resources you're going to
get all over here it definitely is going
to f tune your responses now let's move
to the process so when we are talking
about the prompt libraries the first
step is explore the existing libraries
so you can see that I have given a
reference to a prompt Library all over
here which is released by anthropic
Steam for cloud and also workable for
chat GPD next is you have to understand
the available prompts familiarize
yourself with the prompts available in
this library and including their
structures topics and constraints you
have to also analyze how prompts are
categorized and organized within the
library to quickly locate relevant
prompts for your needs third is adapt to
prompts to your needs customize existing
prompts to suit your specific objectives
audience and use cases you can modify
prompts by adjust in the action verbs
topics constraints or background
information which aligns with your
requirement create your own prompts like
combine different components such as
action verbs topics constraints to craft
prompts that addresses specific task or
challenges next process you have to do
is sharing and collaborating you will
share your prompts with the community to
contribute to the collective pool and
resources so this is one way of learning
that I really really want you to follow
now you have to keep experimenting and
iterating at the same time and finally
you have to see the documents and
organize all your prompts for the same
so what you can do best is see all the
existing prompt libraries like I'll show
you one more so prompt
library for
charb GitHub for all use cases
so you could see explore various
repositories in GitHub like what are the
uh kind of like prompts available like
this repo specifically focuses for the
academic writing so just visit this uh
repository and uh you could see they
have given a lot of thing like for
brainstorming they say so you can see
the action verbs all over here try to
like uh uh try this prompt and see how
you are getting a response then for
article sections like what's it's there
so you're going to get a lot of like
things and uh more of the experiment and
more uh you are exploring the more idea
you are going to get regarding the so my
advice would be just explore as much as
libraries you can and depending upon
your use cases you have to make an
organized prom structure so following
this format which I have told you
follows the action verb the topic or the
background information then what are the
constraints you have to give okay it's
any particular theme is there you have
to include all those things and use the
existing prompt Library also so you can
refine your uh prompt and always to get
a good response it's my personal
experience that you have to keep
fine-tuning keep testing iterating
analyzing so that your result comes very
fine to so guys that was all for today's
