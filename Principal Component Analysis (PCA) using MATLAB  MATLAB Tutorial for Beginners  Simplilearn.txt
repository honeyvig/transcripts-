data is a king in today's modern world
of social media which receives a massim
amount of data every day working with
this ey dimensional data sets can be a
difficult for a data analyst most
well-known companies such as Netflix
Amazon Google Facebook and many others
deals with a large amount of data and
use a principal component analysis
technique to analyze it and to extract
the meaningful insights PCI is the most
commonly used data analysis techniques
in various Industries on that note

question for you in mat Lam which
command is used to add a text label to
the x-axis let me know the answer in the
comment section below now let's have a
brief on agenda for today's session
first we will understand what is PCA
then we will move to why it is used
after that we will understand what are
the benefits of PCA at last we will see
the implementation of PCA for different
data sets now let's try to understand
what exactly PCA
is PCA is a tool for identifying the
main axis of variance within a data set
and enabling data exploration to
understand the key variables in the data
and identify outliers in simple words
PCA is a process to find outliers and
the key variables in a data sets now we
have got an idea about what PCA is now
let's learn why it is
used PCA is a base of multivariant data
analysis using a projection method PCA
is a most commonly used to represent a
multivar data table as a similar set of
variables in order to observe Trends
jumps clusters and outliers for example
we all are familiar with Netflix in
Netflix we have varieties of categories
and numerous of people with their own
choice of category but how will they
classify the number of people in a
different category or in a particular
category Here Comes PCA using PCA we can
calculate the number of categories and
the people who are in that particular
categories assume there are 750 people
with the 15 categories
and we can classify the number of people
in a particular category for example a
category one as a 50 people Category 2
as a 30 people Category 3 as a 40 people
like that 750 people will be classified
within the 15 categories till now we got
an idea about why PCA is used now let's
have a look at what are the benefits of
PCA PCA can help us to improve the
performance at a low rate cost of model
accuracy it includes the reduction of
noise in the data feature selection and
the ability to produce a independent
output uncorrelated data features
furthermore PCA enables to us to
visualize the data and verify clustering
or classifying the algorithms and helps
in improve the algorithm run rate
improve the classification accuracy and
visualization till now we saw what is
PCA why it is used and some of the
benefits of PCA now let's see
implementing PCA for different data sets
we are Implement PCA for three different
data sets for example implementation of
PCA by creating our own data set in
matlb and next we will Implement PCA for
the iris data set and at last we will
Implement a PCA for digit data set now
let's see all this implementation in the
platform as you can see we are inside
the platform mat lab first we will
Implement PCA by creating our own data
sets for do that we have to generate a
data points using a random function I'll
take a variable as
data and I'll create a random integer
values of
th000 into 2 as you can see in the
workspace this will create a th000 cross
2
Matrix now we will just plot this Matrix
using a function called
scatter and we'll plot the
data with the first
column of
Zed First Column of
data with the second column of
data we have to close three brackets and
just press
enter as we can see we have got an graph
of our data with the First Column of our
data to the second column of our data
it's a scatter plot we have so many
datas in our
figure now just quickly go back to our
Command window now we will find the
variance of our data using a variable
V of our
data with respect to the First
Column and the variance is
1.033 now now similarly we'll do the
same for our second
column and we have got the value which
is almost equal to one generally the
variance of any data will be equal to
one now what we'll do we need a more
differences in our data to do that we'll
multiply our data with another Matrix
with the same number of rows and columns
for that I'll take a variable a is equal
to which is of random numbers of 2 cross
2 as we can see we have a variable way a
which is of random numbers and which is
a two cross to
Matrix and now I'll multiply this with
data using a variable X is equal to data
into our
a and we have got our X
now we have got the more differences
data which have the more differences of
th000 into two cross Matrix now we have
to find a PCA for this Matrix before
finding PCA we have to find the
covalence Matrix and the igon values of
that covalence Matrix for that we will
find a covalence matrix of a matrix of
our data which is of th000 into 2 for
that I'll take a variable
equals uh we have a variable called Cove
which will give the covalence Matrix of
the particular input you did I want a
covalence matrix of our data and I'll
just press Enter the covalence Matrix of
our data is almost equal to one now I
the same way I'll find the igon values
and igon vectors for that I will give
igon value for I'll just want to give it
in a square brackets
ion Vector for V and I'll I of Icon
values for
VA which is equal to we'll use a keyword
called I of our covalence
Matrix we have got the igon values and
ion vectors of our covalence Matrix now
we have to find the transforming vector
VOR of our largest igon Vector our
largest igon Vector with corresponding
to igon value is 0.35 24 now we will
find the transforming Vector for our
largest icon
Vector but I'll use a variable called U
is equal to I need the
ion Vector that is I'll say v e of n
entire row with respect to our second
column because the highest value is of
our second column I'll just
press enter and we have got our I
transforming Vector of our highest igon
value now we will find our first
principal component before finding let
me just clear this
screen to find our first principal
component I'll multiply my X into with
my transforming vector and assign to a
variable that is z is equal to X into
U I have got my first principal
component that is z which is of th000
into one Matrix now I'll just find the
variance of my
Zed that is where a of Z
which is equal to
0.59 and quickly I'll find the variance
of my x with the respect to the First
Column and it is almost 0.3 and I'll
just find out the variance of my second
column of X which is equal to
0.938 now let's find the PC P to find
the PCA we have to decode the code to
decode the code we have to multiply this
our Zed into our transforming Vector now
we will multiply and we will decode the
code to get and projection
values but we know we have 1,000 cross 1
which is our Z Val value and our view is
2 cross one to multiply we should have a
same number of columns so what will do
is we'll take a variable Y is equal to Z
into U
transpose you can see when we transpose
our U the 2 cross one Matrix will be
converted into 1 cross two which can be
easily
multiplied now let's plot this X and Y
together using a scatter plot for that I
taking one more figure
and I'll use
scatter of X with respect to the First
Column get of X with respect to the
second
column and I'll just
say
uh yeah just just the scatter spelling
was wrong sorry like now we will just
label our graph by seeing X label to
label our x axis and y axis we can use
the function called X label I'll label
the first one as
pc1 and same as
I'll use this y label
and give it into
PC2 we have labeled our X label y label
and I'll give the
title for our graph that is
PC within the codes we have to give
PCA
plot and I'll just close the bracket and
end with the semicolon enter now we have
the scatter plot with our X label y Lael
and title
I'll just say hold
on
and will plot the V
now scatter of Y with respect to the
First Column and Y with respect to the
second column and the semicolon enter
now we have plotted both X and Y in a
different
figure this is our principal component
analysis plot and this is our PCA line
for a data set like this you can find
PCA for uh creating a own data set in
matlb now let's see how to create or how
to analyze PCA for a iris data
set to start with Iris data set first
see the document
of our Iris data
set as we can see this is our Iris data
set doc which has all the all the
information about the data set data set
contains s length in centimeter petals
length in ctim and to low data set we
need a two variable that is for in one
is for input one is for output all the
information a data set will be present
in the
doc and now we came to know about all
the datas what are the data set contains
and how to load as we know to load we
need a two variables I'll take a
variable for input I'll take it
as
[Music]
input and output
as
output and
I'll read the data set
as Iris data set
as you can see IR set is loaded and the
input is 4 into 150 cross Matrix and our
output is 3 into 150 cross
Matrix now we will transpose our input
and output Matrix because we have 4
cross 150 we need 150 cross 4 Matrix to
perform our PCA for that I'll just do
input is equal to
input and same as I'll do it for output
I'll we are just Transforming Our input
and
output output is equal
to Output
transpose as you can see our our input
and output has been transposed into 150
into 4 4 and 150 into three Matrix as
you if you can see our output is a is in
the vector form now we have to convert
this Vector form into a index form to do
that I'll say Vector
2 index of
our
out
put transpose bracket close
and see our Vector form which has then
the value which has been in the vector
form which is converted into
our index form now what we will do is
now we will just assign this conversion
into our
output output
of I just say output is equal to vector
to
index
of
output transform of whole
transform as we can see we will get this
value which is now our output is 115 to
1
Matrix
now we will
just print our input and
outut in the form
of sorry I just mistake the made a
mistake in
my output spelling now we can see this
four rows is an input and the last one
is an output row as we can see five five
as we know iris is a data set of fls and
its characters and which is I have five
character three 4 1 and 0.2 then the
output is one like that these four rows
contains the input and the last row is a
output now we have the certain amount of
150 inputs and outputs now we will find
the PCA to find PCA I'm using the
keyword called PCA
of
input we have got the PC of our input
which is a matrix
and the Matrix is a 4 cross4 Matrix now
I can also find a
PCA of a
input I don't want this four Cross Four
Matrix I'll just specify this a
new number number of components that how
many components I have in want in my
principal component analysis that is PC
PCA is equal to inputs you can assign to
a variable otherwise you can also do it
like
components close and you should specify
the number if I specify two I want two
components if I specify three I want
three components I want two components
so I specifying it as two and then we
guess when you press
enter we'll get a two we can see now we
have got our PC into two components we
if you want we can that display that by
removing the semicolon we can see PC of
our input with respect to our two
components that we have got we have got
only two components now we will find the
transformation vector and we will find
the pr of our input of this two
components to do that I'll assign this
to a variable U
and
Z close the square and equals now this
is the transformation vector and our
first PCA we are finding our first PCA
of our Iris data set to our input data
of two components I'll just end with the
semic and
enter we have got our U which is of 4
cross2 and we have got our Zed which is
of 1 not5 that is 150 into 2 cross
Matrix now what we'll do we'll plot this
and we'll get our graph to do that I'm
using a scatter
plot for our variable
Zed with respect to the first
row and with the Z with respect to the
second row and add to close two
semicolons and just
enter we got a
figure with the three different we have
Irish data set of three different
flowers that is the characteristics of
one flare characteristics of two second
flare and characteristics of third flare
we'll just make it will just go back to
the command Pro command window and we
will take one more figure
I'll again scatter
plot
said here I'll mention the plot should
be of 20
size with respect to the
output and should be of
fil and at I'll
just just enter and now I'll also give
the color map that
is
color
map with respect to I'll give it as with
the double codes or single Codes Jet
I'll give a color map as Jet and close
and enter now I'll just give the label
that is y l Lael and X label that is X
label will be
my
input
and not close the codes sorry like yeah
my X label will be input and similarly
we do it for y label it will
be
output and and press enter we also give
title for our graph title which is equal
to I'll just give it as
PCA plot and close the code and
semicolon
enter let's go back to our figure this
is our figure which have been filled
colors this is a characteristics of one
FL charactertics of second flow
charactertics of third flow as we can
see in the flow the flow one and the FL
two have some similar characters but the
FL one does not have any single
character which are similar to FL 2 and
FL 3 this is our PCA for Iris data set
now let's see the PCA that is a
principal component analysis for digit
data
set to perform PC on digits you have to
load the digit data set into a current
folder to perform PC any data set which
is not present in the mat lab software
you have to import data data set to do
that you have to go to the home button
in home button you can see there is a
option called import data using this you
can import your data and it will be
available in the current folder when you
import your data it will automatically
come to a current folder which you're
working after that as you can see I have
already imported my digit data set into
my current folder I'll just read the
data
into
read
table of the data set name that
is digit automatically it will show end
with the a semicolon and
enter as you see our data has a
1,797 into
65 rows and Colum columns it is a matrix
of 1,799 cross 65
Matrix as you saw we have read our data
in the form of table but to perform PCA
we want our data to be in the form of
array or the Matrix so to convert a
table data into a matrix or array I'll
use data is equal
to table
to array
of
data now our data is converted into an
array as you can see is a data of 1,767
into 65 which is converted into an array
now I'll take a variable X is equal
to data of all the rows with respect to
First
Column till
end of
last but not the one
column and
enter we have deleted the last row of
our column as we need 767 into 64 Matrix
to do that I just removed the last
column of our Matrix converted into a 64
column now I'll just assign Y is equal
to
data from start starting to
end and end the
semicolon our Y is a single row of our
last data that is 171 into a last column
only a one column now I'll what I'll do
I'll just display my
x with respect the first row and the
entire
column and enter as you can see we have
column 1 with 23 throws 24 columns with
6 46 and 47 columns with 64 rows now
what we'll do we'll just reshape this
data using a function
called
rehap it our
x with respect to the
first
row and all the
columns to a
8
cross8 8 cross crate is a size of our
Matrix that we are reshaping you can see
we have replaced into an 8 cross 8
Matrix of our x what we'll do we'll
again divide this by 16 and end with the
semicolon now we will will display this
image our data set is a data set digit
data set has a data set of images so
what we'll do we try to display that
using a function called I'm am show I'm
am show of
X with the respect to first
row of all
column and which is we have divided into
8 cross 8 and the size
which is divided into a 16 and end with
the bracket and I'll just check if all
the bracket are
closed now just press
enter and we'll get a
figure just let's go back to the figure
and this is a figure the data set which
can't be visible so what we'll do we'll
just again go back to our
command window and we will just find the
PCA now for to find the PCA we need a
transform vector and a PCA for that I'm
using U and Z variable which will be
assigned to a PCA that is using PCA
variable and I'm using x with quotes I
need a numerical components
components only two close and close the
brackets now we have got our transform
invertor and our first PCA now I will
again plot using a different figure
function I'll take one more
figure I'll use a
scatter plot for the variable Zed
with respect to the all the rows and the
First
Column
same as the Z of all the rows to the
second column and I want my bullet size
to be
25 and with respect to the Y and I need
the scatter Pro to be
filled and I'll just close the BR
bracket and
enter now let's give the color
map map
has
J and also Define a color
bar let's see the figure
as you can see this is a output which
has been scattered this is a
1,179
into or converted into our two
dimensional
Matrix now let's go back to
our this and just execute the color
bar after color bar you can see
that a data and the color bar with
respect to the data which has been
scattered but finding the particular
value of a particular point is very
difficult in this scatter plot so what
we'll do we'll just convert this into a
line graph for that I'll just find the C
is equal to coent Matrix of our variable
that is our data
X and I'll just find the E is equal to
sort the
IUN value of my coalin Matrix that is C
and in the order of
descending the descend keyword will
arrange this value in the order of Z
descending and then I'll sum all the
value of e using the keyword called sum
after that we will do the
cumulative sum of our e which is the
Sorting of Icon values with respect to C
in the descending order then again what
I'll do I'll take one more
figure now I'll plot this in the line
gra for that I'm using a plot I'm just
plotting a
using a plot function to plot a simple
graph to our
cumulative
sum of
e was divided by a sum
of e I'll just close two brackets and
enter in figure you can see we have got
this output we have got this line
where we can find out the particular X
and the Y value of uh points easily we
can find when compared to this scatter
gra in Scatter graph using this color
bar finding PC is a bit difficult so we
have just plotted this graph which is
very easy to find the X and Y values of
our
PCA with this we have reached the end of
this session today we have learned what
is PCA some of the benefits of PCA and
we have implemented PCA for the three
different data
sets please share this video with your
