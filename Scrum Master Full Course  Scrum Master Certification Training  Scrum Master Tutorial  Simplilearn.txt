whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back now let's Jump Right In hi welcome
to scrum tutorial from Simply
learn I am CMR Chandra mrr a
professional consultant and Coach who is
certified scrum Master PMP Prince to
practitioner itl for managing
professional devops and kobit 5 as part
of this tutorial we are going to
understand the basic understanding
requirements of scrum the agile
methodology so let us look at a problem
scenario what was there in the absence
of adoption of agile in any given
environment so in the given scenario
there is a problem expressed so we have
a problem our consumer doesn't like our
product we will have to make changes
immediately so now as usual any manager
would respond the manager says make the
changes so because it's always uh the
changes or anything what we deliver is
in the consumer's interest so keeping
consumer interest in mind the value
which needs to be created for customers
any changes required to be done in any
of our projects involving that consumers
and customer we may require to do the
change so but what is the problem here
to do the change so we can't we already
have started work on last batch the
waterfall model we follow doesn't let
changes to be made Midway through the
process so is it mean the waterfall
model never allows the changes to
happen that is not true 100% what fall
model allows us to make changes but it
doesn't allows us to make the changes
quickly so whenever there is a change it
requires lot of effort it requires
changes in documentation it asks for the
changes in uh various different uh
implementations which has already done
which is executed already and then lot
of efforts are involved which is time
consuming and also it involves more cost
now how do we make the change which is
required to the customer and at the same
time we don't have any specific
additional effort which are required so
these efforts whatever is being put is
acceptable to both the parties both the
stakeholders that is the project
organization as well as the customer so
how do we make it happen quickly as well
that is very important for
us so we should have used the agile
methodologies so meaning agile
methodology helps us to do this so one
of the agile methodologies which we are
going to look at as part of this
tutorial is Scrum so let us see how
scrum is going to help the scenario so
scenario of changes which are coming up
more frequently
right right before that let us
understand what is the meaning of agile
what is the meaning of agile uh what it
means and why should we adopt
agile so agile means moving faster being
flexible responding to the changes now
agile is a set of methods and practices
that focuses on iterative development
why iterative in each iterations agile
methodologies helps us to create a
working piece of the software product
which will help us to make quick
corrections to those software piece this
is not a whole product it is part of
that bigger
product so requirements and solutions
are obtained thanks to self-organizing
cross functional teams collaborating so
when we say cross functional team
self-organizing team so these are the
teams which are 7 plus or minus 2 the
size of the team what I'm speaking about
who basically have various different
skills each of the team members will
have various different skills and they
complement to it I think today the
devops is speaking about this cross
functional team owning everything as a
single team some of the organizations
has already demonstrated their devops
capabilities by having these approach
like having self-organizing and cross
functional team having an accountability
for the entire product the particular
piece of the product module what they
have created so this helps in improving
accountability and also ensures better
visibility of the product what is being
created and
delivered so further let us look at the
advantages of using agile so what it
gives to us how it helps so now the
organization who follows the agile
methodologies so we can see that
projects follow a predefined schedule
and have a predictable cost so schedules
are seen
but wherever there is a changes required
wherever there's a directions need to be
changed in terms of making Necessary
changes to adopt to the required
scenario the change scenario agile helps
us it gives that
flexibility so clients have visibility
of each phase of project so it is very
essential whosoever adopts the agile
methodology the active involvement of
customer has to be ensured so they are
actively involved so customers or
clients actively involved in the sense
they know it what is happening what they
are getting they know they are
acknowledging it by giving the feedbacks
every now and then so that there is no
surprise to them at the end which used
to happen during waterfall
approaches then greater interaction
between project team and the project
means there needs to be collaboration
agile emphasizes on having the
collaboration so scrum in specific have
something called uh daily uh scrum where
15 minutes meeting where entire scrum
team should come in sit together uh
self-organizing team as well as all that
agile team has to come together express
what they have completed before the last
daily scrum meeting and what is pending
why is it pending and what is that
they're going to do before the next
meeting so all these are expressed this
will help the team as well as the scrub
Master as well as the product owner the
visibility into what is complete what
needs to be completed and this will help
project manager or scrub Master to
provide the necessary input better
visibility to the customers and
stakeholders as
well product output is predictable and
can sometime happen earlier than
expected so now initially as we know so
the visibility of anything what we do
will be very less so now as we discuss
more and more as we brainstorm more and
more the visibility into it will become
more then what would happen in future
the ability to predict will also become
easier and this doesn't happen only with
the project team it also happens with
customers and every stakeholders who are
involved in the
project so next high quality development
testing and collaboration is ensured
since the project is broken down so now
each iterations each module each piece
of software which is being created are
tested regularly feedbacks are obtained
from the user as well active involment
of user are ensured so that they are
acknowledging it so the what customer
needs are given so it is not that I
discover something which I did not need
I I'm seeing it I told something I'm
getting something that scenario is
eliminated then the product backlog can
be refined and
reprioritized so since we move iteration
wise depending on the Chain scenario
depending on the directions changes we
can keep reordering or reprioritizing
our product backlog what needs to be
created first if have 1 2 3 4 5 item I
can make it as 3 4 1 2 5 so depending on
the change scenario whenever it needs to
be executed it is bit flexible and easy
to do then teams can maximize project
value since clients can provide project
priority so as we know the visibility
also increases to the consumer as well
as all the stakeholders they will also
Express what is that value they have
seen from this and this will also help
in making a decision should we continue
with this project or should we not so
better visibility better decision making
better value
realization the needs of the customer
can be focused on increasing the value
delivered so as customer gives the
feedback as that visibility increases
then a customer is getting that value
and then expressing what is that changes
what is that additionally they may
required here how can make it better so
these interactions can happen so
customer can be focused on increasing
the value delivery so in fact I think
earlier we used to speak about time to
market today we are speaking about time
to Value which means how quickly uh the
consumers the users or customers
realizes the value is that benefit
realized so that's what the more and
more discussion which is happening which
requires closer collaboration with
consumers and their feedbacks their
experiences with the products or
Services which are being used by them it
is very essential to
understand so then various different
methodologies what we have in a Gile we
can speak about scrum kban
extreme programming that is XP lean
methodologies the crystal so now in this
video tutorial we are actually focusing
on scrum so let us understand what is
this scrum is all
about right so before we go and
understand what is the scrum itself so
let us look at the history of scrum
where it started how it started So Right
Down the Line during 1986 the name scrum
is first introduced by the management
experts yukuo nonaka and Hiro takauchi
so Japanese so now this terminology
introduced but later in
1995 Jeff sud land and Ken Shar creates
the early version of what would become
the agile methodologist so now earlier
1995 so need for agile was sensed and it
was spoken about I mean why do we need
AEL methodologies in future what would
be the Future Organization which would
look like so that would trigger in terms
of what kind of approaches we may
require to have so further 2001 the
agile Alliance is founded and first look
on scrum the agile software development
with scrum is published so then further
down the line 2002 the scrum Alliance is
founded by Weber and certifications are
added then later 2006 the scrum in is
created the certified scrum courses are
taught so people started getting
certified on uh
scrum then later 2009 scrum.org is
created which offers the professionals
scrum series of
certifications then 2010 the first scrum
guide is published so which made
available to everyone so from then I
think uh the more and more people start
adopting scrum methodologies now
interesting part is the journey started
from 1980s till 2010 various changes
which has happened to this particular
method ology but one thing we should
keep in mind is same 20 years back or 15
20 years back if we go the need for aile
was not seen so it was spoken but need
for AEL was not spoken much but today we
are speaking about it more and more the
reason is I think the change in the
market condition the increase in the
competition the need of responding to
the change which is asked by the
consumers or the market variations has
become more and more important for
organizations and service providers if
the don't respond to the change they may
lose out in the competition so their
survival is at stake so it is very
essential for them to understand this
Dynamics and respond to those scenarios
quickly so that's where the adoption of
aile the benefit of adopting aile were
realized and scrum become
popular so what is Scrum so let us look
at that so now scrum is a framework that
enables teams to work together means
collaboration is very important while
become agile so with scrum team one can
look I mean see and experience so
learning from experiences happens so
those are captured self-organized
working on problems so they work
together they discuss brainstorm reflect
on their victories means any
achievements has to be celebrated
acknowledged quick wins recognized and
their losses to improve so wherever the
things doesn't go good necessary
Corrections has to be done I think scrum
approach would help in terms of doing it
quicker
better then some of the benefits using
scrum would look like steam can provide
project deliverables and in an efficient
manner so in time we're completing all
the features and functionality so the
the entire model the methodology what is
there which helps in accomplishing those
then further time and money are used
efficiently so time is very important
give results in mentioned schedule is
very important ensuring results are
coming up effectively is important
efficiently the performance of that
products now since we are creating those
small piece working piece in every
iterations so that experience of using
that would also be there and quick
feedbacks will come back so that time
and money is
saved and we are doing in time so
projects are divided into smaller units
called Sprint so the it iterations what
I speaking about the quick iterations of
activities which happens during the
adoption of scrum when organization
adopt the scrum methodology so it is
called as Sprint it's a time box
iterations which will have a set of
subset of product backlog taken as a
Sprint backlog and those users stories
and epics are delivered as part of that
Sprint and then those are reviewed on a
daily basis as part of daily scrum
meeting and also we have other meetings
which will happen when we go and look at
from methodology how this happens I
think we'll get better
visibility work best for fast moving
projects now whenever we need to respond
quickly whenever we want to move faster
now remember when we say moving faster
means it doesn't mean that we can allow
any defects to happen we can ignore
something we cannot do that we need to
ensure everything is taken care at the
same time all those results what are
created has to be
acknowledged right confirmed yes it is
defect free so all those which is
supposed to be addressed are taken care
and things are moving faster and better
and the results are according to what
was actually expressed as a requirement
it is fulfilling
those then scrum meetings provide the
team great visibility since there is a
daily scrum meeting which keeps
happening people speaks about what they
have done from the previous daily scrum
what is that they have accepted they
will complete and what is complete is
everything is complete or something is
spending if it isend pending why is that
pending and what is that you are going
to do further before the next daily
scrum meeting so these are discussed
understood so that there is a quick 15
minutes meeting which gives the insight
and further wherever there is a
dependency deviations which occurs
further maybe scrum Master sit with them
separately to understand that in detail
so daily scrum meetings give the quick
insights so that it increases the
visibility what is happening on
ground constantly involves feedback from
clients and customers as I mentioned
earlier while discussing about agile
active involvement of a customer is very
essential so customer should give the
feedbacks whenever that working piece of
the application or a product is given so
only then uh whether the product or that
module what is created is having that
features and functionality which helps
him providing necessary requirement
fulfillment is that happening or
not then making changes based on
feedback are very easy because everyone
is informed and they are aware of what
is being changed and what needs to be
changed then individual efforts of the
team members are given Focus yes
individual efforts is essential at the
same time each team member cross skills
we call it a self-organizing team as I
was mentioning earlier so each team
member will have a different different
skills different different capabilities
and also cross killing within the team
is encouraged so that the ownership on
individuals deliverables and team as a
whole working together to deliver some
features functionality can also be
accomplished
right then scrum team involves product
owner scrum master and then scrum team
so each of these are different roles
having their own objectives to
accomplish with the specific directions
and each of these cannot be merged like
for example the roles and
responsibilities of product owner cannot
be given given to single individual who
is a scrum master so both the roles
cannot be given a single individual
because it conflicts the objectives of
both the roles so thinking about putting
this one of the team member becoming
scrub Master product owner thinking in
that angle is also something which is
which will not work which will not give
the required results so now what are
these roles what are the
responsibilities where is the focus of
each of the roles so let us discuss on
that now when it comes to product owner
so the product owner is primarily
responsible for maximizing the ROI by
determining the product features
prioritizing it into a list what needs
to be focused on for the next print and
constantly reprioritizing and refining
it so the key points what we need to see
here is so one is determining the
product features maximizing the ROI the
second one and then reprioritizing and
refining the product backlog now why is
that needs to be done so maximiz in Ro
in the sense obviously product owner
should closely work with the business
and have an Insight towards what is that
business require what is that customer
require how it helps customer to
accomplish that result so that it helps
the justifying that investment what
they're doing with the products features
and
functionalities then U speaking about
reprioritizing and refining it it
depends on what features needs to be
delivered in what order so there is
already an order which is defined so So
based on the change scenario you can
reorder it and product owner has that
ownership and responsibilities so the
entire focus is on ensuring the right
product backlog prioritizing it and also
adding that user stories and epics into
product backlog depending on what makes
sense to the business so the scrum
Master the next role helps teams learn
and apply scrum to obtain business value
means scrum Master closely works with
the team so he or she helps remove
impediments what is
impediments something which stops to
move forward something which doesn't
allow to deliver things the way it is
required something which stops right so
that needs to be eliminated that needs
to be understood what are the
impediments so when we say impediments
what are the impediments we can think of
the skills and capabilities of the team
that is one thing maybe the testing
environment maybe a process so many
things comes as a bottleneck or
pediments which stops things to move
smoo forward so scrub Master should work
on it identify that and support team or
guide team to overcome those so protects
them from interfaces that helps the team
to adopt agile practices so encouraging
team to adopt agile practices and
ensuring they demonstrate and provides
the recorded value as it move forwards
so since scrum Master focuses one side
in terms of making scrum team to work
whereas product owner is looking at the
entire product backlog and working more
closely with the business so they need
to have a good handshake to ensure
things go well but these two roles
cannot be merged because since it has a
two different angles and two different
Dynamics so spending time accomplishing
both the things may become very
challenging and
conflicting and prioritizing will also
be difficult then scrum team is the
collection of all the individuals who
work together to deliver the
requirements of the stakeholders so
self-organizing team what I was
mentioning what we were discussing
earlier so these teams comes together
each of the team member will have
various different capabilities so they
contribute at the individual level and
as a team as a whole complement or
contribute towards ultimate output and
outcome and value what they need to
create and this team should have a clear
understanding about the deliverable what
is being done so is that deliverable
what features and functionality what
they're thinking is that going to create
that value ultimately what is need to be
achieved the requirement fulfillment
which is which needs to be happened to
the customers so they need to have that
understanding the direction should be
clear to the
team so there are certain artifacts to
look at when it comes to scrum so let us
look at that so now we speak about the
artifacts which are the components of
the scrum process that can improve
transparency and understanding of the
work so there are three artifacts mainly
which we call it as product backlog
Sprint backlog then uh product increment
so let us see what is this one by one so
when I say product backlog so it
consists of list of new features changes
to be made to existing features the buck
fixes changes to the infrastructure and
several other activities that the team
needs to deliver to ensure a particular
outcome so this list of product backlogs
comes with required features and
function ities what needs to be
delivered so the prioritization of this
has to happen in what order what needs
to be delivered so the product backlog
is the full list which needs to be
delivered as part of this project and as
the project progresses lot of new
backlog item would be added to the
product backlog as the Dynamics of the
particular scenarios keeps changing so
keeps adding reprioritizing additional
items to the backlogs are added
depending on what are those Dynamics
so further looking at a Sprint backlog
so Sprint refers to that short period of
iterations right so which team aims to
get a given amount of work done so it
helps teams deliver working software in
a frequent manner so Sprint could be
between 1 to 4 weeks long depending on
what is the deliverable is so Sprint
backlog is a subset of product backlog
so that prioritized item what is taken
into Sprint which is a time box
iteration
the Sprint backlog contains the task the
team aims to complete to satisfy the
Sprint goal so what is that Sprint goal
so each of those iterations the time box
iterations will have a specific
objective to accomplish so the Sprint
goal is the objective decided for the
Sprint as an outcome of negotiation
between the product owner and the team
so what can be delivered how long it
takes to deliver so when it has to be
delivered the target may be given by
product owner but is it possible
feasible to complete it there there is
some negotiation which happens there so
they decide they agree yes we can do it
we cannot do it if at all we can do it
what is that it takes in terms of effort
time and cost everything is decided
discussed so that objective of that
particular iterations is agreed upon so
once it is agreed I think team should
first identify the tasks from the
product backlog that need to be
delivered to achieve the goal so these
tasks are then added to sprit backlog so
there should be an agreement between
both and once it is added once it is
agreed as part of that Sprint the
deliverable the output of the Sprint
would be the one which needs to be
completed as part of it the objectives
the goal the results which a specific
working
software then product increment so this
refers to the combination of all product
backlog tasks completed in the Sprint
and the value of the increment of
previous Sprints now when we speak about
lean lean speaks about elimination of
waste it speaks about Valu dreams now in
each of the prints as we have a working
software being delivered now each of
these piece should keep complimenting to
the what is the one which is already
delivered and what is being delivered in
future so keeping that in mind every
deliverable will be implemented or
configured in such a way that there is
no specific bottlenecks there is no
specific constraints which arises so
these needs to be kept in mind which
requires the entire visibility into what
is the ultimate objective we are going
to accomplish so in this product
increment all those combination of the
product backlogs task which is being
done should keep this in mind team
should be very clear about it so I in
the first Sprint I delivered something
in the Sprint two I delivered something
but I cannot integrate them they cannot
work together it will lead into the
further issues and then complications
that should not happen so when we say
agile it's about moving faster fine so
responding to change fine but that
should not lead towards further comp
lexity it should make things simpler
smoother so scrum is stressing on that
part so an increment refers to
inspectable usable work done at the end
of the Sprint it represents a step
towards overall goal or vision of the
project as I was mentioning then the
outcome should be in usable condition
even if the product owner doesn't decide
to release it so it should be usable
condition so two things we speak about
so one is release other one is
deployment now people usually get
confused between release and deployment
so release about this part what we're
speaking about product is
usable so it is released product is
usable but only after deployment user
will have an access to use it so that is
a difference release makes that product
usable whereas deployment makes it
available to the user to use so this
difference people should know so release
doesn't mean that it is already
available for user to use so this
understanding of the difference should
also be there so that one can understand
what it means by release as well and
what it means by deployment that's why
when we speak about DeVos we keep
speaking about cicd in cicd we speak
about continuous integration continuous
uh delivery and continuous deployment so
in continuous delivery we speaking about
release basically so once it is released
it becomes usable so once it is deployed
it is available for user to use
and that's about the scrum artifacts now
let us look at scrum framework how that
scrum framework looks like in entirity
so what are the components comes into
picture already we spoke about the scrum
approach itself what it is now we spoke
about understanding artifacts then we
spoke about roles in scrum the
activities for each of the roles we
understood now where do we see all of
this when we look at a scrum framework
so that picture let us see so when we
say scrum framework already we spoke
about the product backlog we can see
that it is in the left side in the
beginning we have a Sprint planning so
we spoke about Sprint the time box
iterations and from the product backlog
the items which is moving towards Sprint
to a specific Sprint what needs to be
delivered which become Sprint backlog
now the backlog items are taken and
scrum team or on it and does a daily
scrum meeting and once the deliverables
of that particular print happens then
there is a review on it then the
increment is delivered and at the same
time that retrospective what was planned
versus what is delivered that is checked
if you look at from Sprint review so you
have a retrospective to check what is
planned versus what is being delivered
at the same time the review points will
come and get updated to product backlog
as well to the product owner so product
owner should be aware what is delivered
what is spending to be delivered and
that increment is further delivered so
these increments what is delivered
production what is deployed in the
production should have values that
integration which happens both all the
increments coming together to provide
that fulfillment of the requirement as
well as creating that value what is
required so product backlog is the first
step of scrum framework is a set of list
of tasks to have successfully achieved
the goals of the stakeholders we discuss
that we'll discussing on product backlog
so further Sprint planning happens where
the team Det mindes the task from the
product catalog they will work on and
aim to deliver during the Sprint now
this is negotiated understood agreed and
then M towards Sprint to get delivered
then Sprint backlog are the tasks
discussed during the Sprint planning
means the previous step and also during
the script planning and then added to
the Sprint backlog once it goes to the
Sprint backlog as part of the time box
iteration Sprint the deliverables should
happen
now scrum team the scrum team which is
actually self-organizing team as we
mentioned maybe five to 10 nine members
of Team working on the task in the
Sprint backlog and they will also have a
daily scrums where the team also
discusses for 15 minutes on the events
where the team member synchronizes
activities and plan what they aim to
achieve in next 24 hours what is
accomplished against what is discussed
in previous daily scrum and then if at
all any further discussions need to be
done in the correction of those that can
be taken as a separate meeting not as
part of the daily scrum so generally
daily scrum meeting would be 15 minutes
it should not go more than that it's an
indicative time so quicker updates to
understand what is
happening then uh the Sprint review
happens where once the Sprint is
complete so Sprint review happens which
involves the team the scrum master and
product owner and stakeholders to
understand what is being agreed upon and
what is being delivered so reviewed is
that fulfilled in the entirety that is
discussed and then during this meeting
the team shows what they accomplished
during the Sprint it allows time to ask
questions make observations give
feedback and provide suggestions right
then the product owner also presents the
product backlogs to to the stakeholders
to get feedback for upcoming Sprints and
about things related to the backlog now
this one Sprint is is complete for the
next print what should be the
prioritization so the product owner has
to speak with the stakeholders so that
there is a good understanding good
handshake that what needs to be
delivered and what is the priority in
the given
list then Sprint retrospective happens
so after the Sprint review Sprint
retrospective happens so during this
meeting what went well like past
mistakes potential issues what are the
new ways to handle them which are
required to be done correctly in the
next iterations or next prints needs to
be identified data from found from here
are Incorporated when planning the news
Sprint so it's works like a Lessons
Learned what went well what did not go
well what is that we did for those what
did not go well so what is that learning
we have in these iterations so how can
we ensure that in the upcoming
iterations the same mistakes are will
not repeat so those can be uh discussed
documented and then consider while more
moving to the next
spring then the increment is a workable
output which is given to the
stakeholders so this is where the user
actually sees that workable piece
working item and then they give
necessary feedback as well on the
particular application piece or software
piece then there is something called
scrum board which is used during this
flow of scrum right from product backlog
to the creation of that increment so let
us look at what is a scrum board which
is used during the scrum scum practice
so scrum board is a physical or virtual
tool that helps team to visualize items
in the Sprint backlog so it helps in
tracking what is being delivered what is
in progress and what needs to be
delivered further so it shows all action
items during the daily scrum helping
keeping the team focused on tasks that
need to be completion and the priorities
of those the scrum board is usually
present in a place that's accessible to
all team members it is a visual board
right and can be physical whiteboard and
stickers or virtual software tools which
can be used and displayed on the screen
so the scrum board is divided into
different slots like too in progress and
done so when new Sprints are started the
existing board is reset and new scrum
board is created so since it is visual
system I think it is taking the thought
from kban so visual system always works
effective because the moment I know I
see something is is uh put against my
name that I need to complete this it's
quite obvious to me that I will put
efforts to complete it so it's a
conscious effort what I will put it
works on my Consciousness so something
which is not visible to me it is that
out of sight is out of mind so I will
not work on it so I may there is a
tendency to
forget first slide here has to do with
user stories and epics and what I want
to do to is I want to before we get into
the user stories I want to go to the
Whiteboard and I want to just give you a
little bit more
information that might help us in
organizing our discussion that we're
about to embark on
here so a word that is not in our slides
is
themes themes are
epics and user stories grouped together
you know similar epics and user stories
grouped together for planning purposes
so an epic is Big um you would never do
an epic in or pardon me a theme in a
Sprint it's too big um so it's used for
planning
purposes below that I would put epics
epics are low
priority large user stories
meaning that an ethic will eventually
have to be disaggregated into multiple
user
Stories the reason it would be low
priority is because if it w if an epic
was higher up on the product
backlog um it would have to be more
detailed that's when you would break it
down so epics are usually going to live
at the lower uh priority levels of a
product backlog and as user stories are
completed in the epic rises in priority
it will eventually be broken down into
um more manageable user stories so great
big low priority user stories then we
have user stories
themselves user
stories are
functions or
features that the product owner wants to
have developed a user story turns into
working
software that provides value to the
customer and um and the product owner is
the customer voice the product owner is
the one who would accept or reject
completed user
stories and then there are
tasks and a reminder when we were
talking about the Sprint planning
meeting we said the Sprint planning
meeting is uh got two parts to it the
first part is selecting all of the user
stories that are going to be in included
in the Sprint and then disaggregating
each of those user stories into
tasks that's done in the Sprint planning
meeting and then those tasks are the
things that are actually then done when
the uh work of the Sprint
begins user stories can be estimated in
story
points or ideal days most teams favor
story points they might start with ideal
days but they will then usually end up
going to story points um tasks are uh
estimated in
I ideal
time which is usually ours okay so now
back to our slides so at the top left a
use case could be an example of a user
story so it's something that um the user
wants to do and how the system should
support
um like um a use case could
be um select and pay for items in a
catalog now that could actually be an
epic or maybe a theme because maybe it
would get disaggregated into log on
screen uh catalog uh shopping cart and
checkout but so the use case could
either be a standalone user story or it
could actually be
uh a number of user stories um that
would result from it below that
requirement it could be a functional
requirement a technical task or even a
bug fix so I'm going to go back to the
Whiteboard and a product
backlog is going to have a lot of user
stories that come from the
customer right whatever the customer
wants
done but the team may know that it has
to do some develop work in order for the
user stories to even be able to work you
know there's some system level
non-functional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be Tech user
stories and then can you see this low I
can't see your chats but then there
could also be defect user stories there
could even be RIS user stories now what
could happen is that um the product
owner ranked the these in priority so
this one first then that one then that
one and the team says well the only
thing is is that um we have to do some
development work before we can actually
do user story to and so what we really
need to do is insert that before the uh
the second priority user story and so
the priority of the user stories in the
product backlog while it might start
with just being you know simple
functional user stories coming from the
uh product owner it will evolve until it
includes some other things that are also
considerations when it comes to uh
priorities because of you know successor
predecessor relationships dependencies
and things like that are um
considerations a user story be uh back
to the the uh screen um bottom left now
the user
story um can use a fictitious user or a
Persona to help uh the team or the the
team and the product owner to get an
idea of okay who's going to be doing
this function uh what are they going to
need in order to be able to complete the
function Etc so you try and um come up
with an actual well a fictitious but a
person who's actually doing it to kind
of get out of the realm of you know
listing requirements and you know specs
and things like that and say okay what's
the user experience need to look like
top right template a portion of a user
story is um let me back up so a user
story card um is usually going to
contain um a brief description of the
user story using some kind of a metal
language format like we're suggesting
right here as a user or Persona I want
this feature so that I can so not unlike
our um estimating session here as a
frequent traveler I want to eat grapes
so I can be healthier in the one that we
uh didn't do uh the inventory system as
a customer okay there's a a user
I want to get cash back so I don't have
to wait in line at the bank okay here's
another user story as a
consumer I want the shopping cart
functionality to easily purchase items
online and maybe that could be customer
as well um as an executive right as a
suit I want to generate a sales report
so I know which departments need to
improve their productivity
as a buyer so you can see I I tried to
come up with these different roles right
here executive buyer sales rep Etc
um and that's the format as a type of
user I want some kind of goal um or
feature and uh so that's some kind of a
reason um the below that connect connect
the dots by writing all of the user
stories necessary to uncover
the entire use case so like we were
talking about right here if you want to
be able to purchase items online from a
catalog that might be uh multiple user
stories in order to support that use
case and so of course um we would want
to be able to connect the dots and see
where all the user stories fit in into
the overall goal of the project or
release and the stories
um excuse
me um are
grouped to form an epic or higher level
story so epic or theme um stories can
then be split into child stories or task
and so that's what we were covering
before right so you have um
themes up at the top that's the biggest
grouping if you will used primarily
for um you know high level planning
purposes so you have your themes then
you have your epics which are large user
stories um low priority and they're
going to have to be broken down into
smaller user stories like in the
question that we had at the end of the
the last section where um the product
owner needed something done and the team
said well based on the size of this user
story it's going to take three Sprints
to do well a user story has to be small
enough to be completed within a single
Sprint so a Sprint can contain more than
one user story but a user story cannot
span Sprints so that feature or function
that was in the question was probably
more like an epic it was something that
would need to be uh disaggregated into
smaller user stories or perhaps it was
more of a use case that would need more
than one user story in order to actually
deliver the overall use
case let's see as a product supervisor I
want to see an UNF finished part
list at the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day great user
story description well done
verage um did you hear that team as a
product supervisor I want to see an
unfinished part list at the end of the
day so I can reallocate work the next
day that is a well-crafted description
of a user
story
now here are some things things that I
want you to memorize you were hoping I
was done with the memorization part so I
want you to
um remember that we have to invest in
our user
stories and I was going over to the
Whiteboard and I didn't change cameras
so let me do that I recommend um you
know figuring out how you memorize best
so that you can if um
well not if you wanted to what I
recommend is being able to write out all
of this stuff on plain white scrap paper
in about 14 minutes because that's the
amount of free time you have in the
tutorial when you're at the uh or when
you're taking the test um exen does a
little bit different you maybe won't
have a tutorial the only time you'd have
a tutorial is if you were at a center
taking a test um exen has other options
like you can do a paper based test
um uh where you get a third party you
know a buddy or somebody who will agree
to sort of procer the test for you or
you can do it on your laptop all by
yourself and they have software that
watches you while you're taking the test
and they require you to take the laptop
and do like a 360 so that um they can
verify that you don't have any cheat
sheets up on the wall or anything like
that but the point is is um you got to
have this memorized um whether you're
going to dump it out on the paper or not
um when I took the test um I actually
did the paper based option um and that
was because of some kind time
constraints and it was the quickest way
to get me into the test and so I didn't
write out any of the stuff I'd memorized
but I had it memorized and I had it
memorized well enough that I could kind
of recall it in my mind's eye okay
so we're talking about user stories and
you have to invest in your user stories
you know I like memorizing things by
creating these charts that have the
first
letter of the word or phrase that you're
memorizing in a separate column and then
I make up a story you know that uh um
reminds me that I've got to have in vest
this one is pretty easy probably just
invest Works um but so let's go over
that I stands for
independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own um you don't have when
we're doing scrum you don't do a user
story that won't result in working
software we just talked about the
description of user stories right so
it's a user that needs some kind of
functionality for some kind of a reason
and they're all independent will they
work together of course they'll work
together if that's a necessity but um if
you developed a log on screen you could
demonstrate working software for the
login screen there might be another user
story that is um you know has to do with
displaying uh the catalog and being able
to flag or select items that you want to
purchase but there'd be working software
for that would they work together yes
but each user story would
complete um or result in some kind of
working software and they have to be
independent
negotiable negotiable in the way the
user story is going to be
implemented the product owner doesn't
dictate to the team the team doesn't say
it it's only this way and we don't want
to hear anything from you so there are
discussions about the size and
implementation for each user user story
so the product owner can't make it so
detailed that there's no room for
discussion and the possibility of you
know the team coming up with Solutions
other than what the product owner was
attempting to
dictate um v stands for
valuable meaning each user story has to
create value for the customer or the end
user e it has to be
estimable as an estimat except estimable
is not really a word it's
cble um and ass as for small has to be
small enough to be done in a single
Sprint if we're doing two we Sprints has
to be able to be done in two weeks or
less if we're doing four-week sprints it
could be a larger user story but it
would still uh have to be done in four
weeks or less and then the last one the
t is testable every user story needs to
be testable and it needs to be testable
at two levels remember our triangle
needs to be be testable at the intrinsic
quality level unit tests Etc and also
testable at the extrinsic level which is
the customer point of view which is
acceptance so every user story uh has to
be
testable okay so that's invest and so
let's add that to our list of things to
memorize
invest and then the next one we have
here is um the three C's of a user
story so the first C team is
card so user stories should be able to
be written on a 4x6 inch index card or
some uh media similar to
that
card the the second C is conversation
the user story card is the item that is
used for the team and the product owner
to talk and discuss in order to make
sure that the product owner and the team
are on the same page when it comes to
what is actually supposed to be
developed and um uh what you know so
what it's supposed to to look like at
the end which leads us to the third one
which is
confirmation each user story essentially
has to have acceptance tests um in it
itself so card 4x6 conversation that's
the starting point that's where uh the
team and the product owner discuss and
then eventually there will be acceptance
tests included on the user story card um
in order to be used during the Sprint
review to um assure that it's acceptable
that there's
confirmation okay so oh let's add that
to the memorization
list
so three
C's all right now I've got an example
here of a user story
card so we're looking right
here and if you were to go out on the
internet and search um user story cards
um they would be similar there would be
some differences of course
um but typically what you're going to
have is you're going to have a title or
a name for the user story and then
there's going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 321 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about as a librarian I want
to have the facility of searching a book
by different criteria so that I will
save time while serving a
customer then there might be some other
descriptive words or links to other
information that might be necessary and
then there would be acceptance criteria
or tests sometimes these get included on
the back of the card but the point is is
that they are on the chord on the card
rather then there will be an estimate of
size
it could be ideal days or story points
as I mentioned most teams do story
points that's more likely what you'll be
tested on as opposed to um ideal days
but you know we'll cover both so you
understand uh the
differences um there is probably it's
not listed here but there's probably
going to be a
um Value Point a shine
this is where the product owner um kind
of determines in a relative way the uh
value of the stories just like we were
doing in planning poker the product
owner might say well this story is twice
as valuable as as uh this other one
comparing them together and this is what
um these value points are what's used to
uh prioritize the user stories that's
supposed to be a v as in value points
and then typically there's also going to
be a indication sometimes it's just by
colors um could be words uh that has to
do with um you know where the story came
from did it come from the customer that
would be considered a functional
requirement um if it came from the team
that would be from the technical domain
I'm trying to write where
from uh you know not me team it's the
mouse
clearly it's hard to uh do that that's
from where from um here it's got uh
customer tech you could also have defect
you could maybe have risk um and then
there's also going to be an X
Factor um which would
be some kind of word probably like
um stable
um
erratic um
incomplete something like that to uh so
that the team is designating the user
story in uh respect to the amount of
uncertainty or risk that's associated
with that user story and because all of
that's a part of the story right the
story is going to be turned into working
software there may need to be uh some
efforts to actually figure out how to
actually do that user story
story so that's the X Factor um over to
the right here on the same chart we have
some comments
about um if you are using a software
package excuse me like Trello or jira or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that
um could even include things like
responsible team member or depending on
how you're doing it you would break the
user Story down into tasks and you might
have team members assigned to various
tasks for the user
story um okay so that's typically what a
user story card is like sometimes their
cards sometimes are like on sticky notes
and they're put up on a can ban board if
you're using can ban to track the
project
if you have a story that is too large to
be completed in a Sprint it's going to
have to be subdivided or we call it
disaggregation into um smaller user
stories and there's uh three ways that
we're proposing here that you could go
about doing that you could split it
based on operational boundaries for
example as an operator one needs to
manage reservations which could be split
for example there could be one portion
that is uh that has to do with making a
reservation another one that has to do
with modifying it and yet another one
that has to do with canceling it so um
that could be split into in this
construct here three separate user
stories you could also separate based on
exceptions or crosscutting concerns for
example in the beginning develop only
one main path like accept repayment for
a loan
then address exceptions like what if a
person um
overpays then um come up with a user
story that recognizes that and processes
a refund and or gives the option of
allocating the overpayment to a future
payment or something like that and then
also um um adds on other concerns like
the check access restrictions or record
name of operator so maybe um you know
when you're working on uh accepting
payments or processing refunds it's
going to check on um who the operator is
or track that so that if at a later time
you know who was it that gave this uh
refund here well you could look and see
you know okay the the operator's name
was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
um is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different
privileges okay and then down at the
bottom split Based on data boundaries
for an example you know as an accountant
one needs to enter balance sheet
information um which could then be split
into summary
information and
separately um uh receivable details or
you know maybe you could have AP you
know so you could have different
portions the
overall
um balance sheet um activities that need
to be done so enter AR enter
AP
Etc make sense so just to kind of uh
prompt you give you some ideas about
what to do um in a scrum project if you
have the scenario arise where a user
story is being estimated by the team and
it won't fit into a Sprint too
big now when it comes to determining
value for user stories this is primarily
owned by the uh product owner right and
it always comes back to money but money
you know the value can be looked at from
different points of view so new Revenue
obviously you know getting new customers
and having them buy
stuff um well below that there's another
consideration incremental Revenue uh so
somebody's in the process of placing an
order um maybe there are some premium
features that could be add-ons at that
point in time um or may be added later
on so you have an existing customer who
actually
buys um more of or enhanced parts of the
existing thing they already purchased or
are in the process of purchasing
retained value so this is um
you know retaining customers so that
they don't go to a
competitor and then the bottom one is
operational efficiency you know how
could things be done to speed up the
process of whatever it is um so that the
cost of delivering uh the product is
reduced so this then leads us to a
discussion about priorities recognizing
that there are some priority concerns
that come from both the customer domain
as well as the technical
domain and there are some prioritization
models um if we look right here there is
value based
prioritization and the hierarchy of that
would be high value followed by high
risk followed by high value and then low
risk followed by low value and then low
risk so you know we might have written
this a little bit differently but that's
value based prioritization and this is
primarily the product owner with maybe
some input from the team to Simply
deciding um what he or she wants the
most listening to the team say well you
know there's some you know greater risks
with this user story than that and so
you'd probably want to uh pers the
product owner to take care of high-risk
stuff first um because that would have
an a uh oh excuse me sorry an impact on
the future things that need to be
done there's the C the Cano model uh
which looks at each of the user stories
and classifies them as being mandatory
linear or
exciters and the mandatory items are
those user stories that are musts and
they'll never move Beyond move the
customer or the end user beond neutral
it's if they're not there it creates
dissatisfaction if the the you the
product owner and the team has done a
good job in identifying what are the
mandatory or threshold items um you
would see that
um um it just gets it to neutral that's
what's expected for the the product
linear items um user stories are those
user stories that as they are
implemented progressively throughout the
project and added to the feature set it
will linear increase customer
satisfaction and it can be you know in
their absence dissatisfaction all the
way up to high implementation creating a
great deal of satisfaction for the
customer and then the third category is
exciters and delighters
um and those are features or functions
those are user stories that are not
mandatory and the absence of them will
never result in satisfaction going below
neutral but by adding them um you could
create excitement and Delight for the
customer these would typically be things
that
are features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or maybe
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or
whatever so that's the Cano model and
then there's weager relative waiting
method and um this is all using numbers
so each feature is given a value for its
benefit and its penalty given a value
for penalty meaning what's the pain if
that feature or function is not included
and then there is um um the cost side
and the risk
side and then those are all calculated
together and that results
in excuse me a ranking or a hierarchy
which gives you the uh priority for the
uh user
stories um we also talked about Moscow
didn't we did we talk about Moscow uh
Moscow is another prioritization model
must
could I said that differently must
should could won't Moscow mscw must
should could
won't and we talked about that one thank
you for that
confirmation does it seem like a long
time ago or is it just me I know it was
just last weekend but it's like last
year okay so now let's talk about
velocity um uh Bianca that is exactly
right
um so velocity is the capacity of the
team to
complete work in a single
iteration so the team has estimated the
user stories uh for size or ideal days
and um the spren are going to be three
week weeks in duration obviously not all
user stories can be completed in a
single Sprint and be done with the
project well I guess maybe I shouldn't
say Obviously when I'm saying that I'm
thinking well maybe you had a very small
short duration project so you could but
the point is is that uh it's the team's
capacity to um complete work in a given
Sprint and it
is an observation it's not a prediction
so if we're working on Sprint
five and we're working on determining
what our velocity
is then um it would be the average of
the previous four
Sprints if there were any uh outliers
you you would disregard
those
um and so it's an observation
if we look over to question or uh box
number two here velocity is used to deal
with um determining how many user
stories we are going to include in a
given Sprint and also how many Sprints
are we going to need to create a release
or a set of user stories and here's an
example in box number three a team
completed five us user stories that were
sized 5 3 8 13 and
two two user stories each sized five
were left half complete what is the
velocity of the
team and the answer is either going to
be 31 or
36 31 is the sum of the completed user
stories um if you were 36 you were
claiming half of the two that were five
uh so that would be a total of 10 so you
claim half of it which be five would
take you to
36 but it's not going to be 36 because
the only thing that counts
towards progress is working software so
even if the team had finished nine out
of 10 story points for a user story
meaning it's almost done and then the
Sprint ends that doesn't get counted
towards
velocity and you don't mess around with
velocity um you can mess around with
your
estimating and you can mess around with
um you know what user stories are going
to be completed in a Sprint but you
don't the the velocity is not variable
it is what it is based on past
performance when it comes to levels of
plan planning we have What's called the
planning onion and let me walk you
through this here up at the the broadest
area is the vision level so the vision
level that's the suits right they're the
ones that have the strategy and
objectives for the company and where
it's going and so they have that overall
big vision for the uh
company which is likely going to include
products and each product should have a
map my example of that website that I'm
uh working on has uh three versions um
which make up the product road map
version one is the free site version two
is the membership site and version three
is the um uh the pay referral
commissions uh uh version of the site
and the product road map is then
supported by releases
so for my project I have three releases
so all of the user stories needed for
the free version are in release one all
of the additional user stories that are
needed for the um uh paid version the
subscriber
version uh and then also for version
three those are all releases three
releases and then for each Sprint we
will be pulling user stories from the
release that we're working on a release
is likely going to take multiple Sprints
and um and then the Sprints are
populated by the individual user stories
which are then disaggregated into
tasks and we do the excuse me the daily
scrum which is the daily level of
planning and coordination so we call
that the planning
onion we already kind of talked about
the release and roadmap um concept here
so let's just review this quickly um
priories high level ethics and determine
goals and releases so we'll use epics
and themes in order to group things
together you know what should be
included in what release so what are the
goals for the releases then the first
bullet point establish goals of release
based on market demand regulatory needs
or customer
expectations for each release you want
to estimate the target stories
repeat until the target stories are
assigned and iteration
length I that's it's blending some
things here um be able to estimate
velocity and then uh assign stories to
the Sprints so we keep estimating the
user stories and we keep organizing uh
that until we can do that we can come up
with an iteration length or Sprint
length and then figure out what our
velocity for each Sprint is and then uh
assign stories to the uh the Sprints uh
the the next bullet down iterate until
the user stories and release date meets
conditions of satisfaction so that's uh
definition of done or acceptance for the
release and try not to pack too much
into a release backlog
so
um just like you would not want to pack
too many user stories into a Sprint you
want to have the timelines appropriate
and uh what are included in the uh
events uh make
sense okay so here's a bit more about
release planning on this slide here um
you've got the product backlog here on
the left and then we might come up with
a release plan which could be flipped
and could be looked at uh
horizontally and you probably
plan um
about three releases in
advance um or at least you're doing more
of the detailed planning on that uh
because things are going to emerge when
we do you know Sprint one that's going
to help in Sprint two and things that
happen in Sprints one and two that are
going to help um release three and then
you've got um you know your subsequent
releases where we're just doing very
high level planning it's called rolling
wave planning where we do detailed
planning for things in the future and
tandem with doing high level planning
for things in uh the future did I say
that right detail planning for things in
the near term in tandem with highle
planning for things in the
future um and we talked about deciding
as late as possible I believe meaning
that it's better to actually plan the
later uh
releases uh for purposes
of uh making sure we have more
information uh the most information
available okay so
estimation let's start at the top left
the principles behind estimation
understand the cone of
uncertainty which is an estimate or best
guess to begin with and then
progressively becomes more accurate in
fact let's just take a break and look at
the cone of uncertainty so at the very
beginning of a project there's going to
be a high level of
uncertainty um if I were to draw this
chart I would make it a little bit more
like
this so clearly you're going to drisk
the
project as early as you can and then
eventually all risk disappears when the
project is done risk is
uncertainty okay be below that the only
estimate that matters is the one given
by the
team supported by this uh comment here
nothing is impossible for the one who
doesn't have to do it so the product
owner is like team come on you can do
this the team's like no we know what our
velocity is no the product owner says
I'm telling you there's no way that that
can't be done I know you can do it I
trust you I believe in you but the
product owner doesn't have to do have to
do the work okay top right
overestimation and underestimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with it's more likely that we will
underestimate than
overestimate and by looking at our
velocity from iteration or Sprint to
Sprint um there could be some
information that is um showing us that
we're underestimating for example
meaning um we're thinking we you know
the user stories are smaller than they
are and that we can get you know a
certain number done in the Sprint and
then there's a fail well that would mean
then that would be discussed during the
retrospective and then we would do
something different going forward which
might include doing some reestimating
scrum estimating is not necessarily more
difficult however scrum exposes bad
estimate sooner which is a good thing
when we were doing our um uh planning
poker you could see that um the first
time as a team you know we didn't know
each other we didn't know everybody's
thoughts and concerns and those kinds of
things you know get shared and absorbed
as a project goes on and so there's a
higher awareness of that so um what we
would say is that um you using
estimation techniques scrum estimation
techniques might be um more inaccurate
at the beginning of a project but they
will quickly become very accurate as the
um project advances
forward let's see is there a question
here can velocity be increased over a
period of time for the project yes it
can now it's not that it can it will
increase if team is learning how to work
together better and better you would
expect that if I can just use my mouse
here if we were
tracking velocity so this would be um
points completed over here uh let me
just do pts for points and down here is
time and we go from Sprint to Sprint
right you you would expect that maybe
you know the first couple of Sprints the
team would be learning how to work
together and there would be a steep
curve and then it would kind of flatten
out and maybe have you know a slow rise
going forward as the team emerges as a
high performing team they get better at
their cross uh functional Behavior you
know somebody's shck the team just keeps
chugging along um other things you know
just um oh
sorry there I bumped the thing on my
screen there
um um so the team you know learns how to
work better together and you know their
estimates become more accurate Etc and
you would expect a high per a high
performing team to have a uh a result
like this for velocity where there's
quick Improvement and then it kind of
stabilizes and then begins to tick
upwards
okay we talked about the cone of
uncertainty let's talk about ideal time
um when we do estimating for user
stories um we do it in ideal days when
we do estimating for tasks we do it in
ideal time which means hours I think
that's on the Whiteboard or it was on
the Whiteboard oh it was on it um so
Ideal Time is the amount of time it
takes to complete a piece of
work but that's based
on the notion
that the team member or members are
available to do just the work with no
distractions or anything at all so
assuming that um prian could sit down
add a keyboard and code for eight hours
without taking a break for lunch no
phone calls no discussions no meetings
of any kind just work eight hours how
much could be done in that eight hours
by prianka that's what ideal time is but
the thing of it is is that there is no
such thing as somebody being able to
spend every minute of every day only
doing work there will be um
distractions so it has to be converted
into a lapse time now we don't convert
it to aapse time at the user story level
but we do convert it to aapse time when
we are dealing at the task
level and what that looks like is you
know for each team member you're going
to have to do it separately because some
team members have more distractions than
others some might have other duties that
pull them away um whatever the case may
be um you determine how much time in a
given day a team member is available to
do work so say it's five hours out of
eight for one maybe it's six hours out
of eight for another maybe it's four out
of eight but you figure out what it is
and then you take the average and that
average availability is used then to
convert Ideal Time into elapse time
um I should have circled this box here
because we talked about this as well um
and then I already mentioned this here
only considers actual work time not the
distractions so that's the concept of
Ideal time when it comes to story points
it's different than that they are a
measure of size relative to each other
so we were doing planning poker this
morning where um we were looking at
grapes versus apples and then we were
looking at oranges and and what else do
we have watermelons and coconuts and we
weren't trying to figure out how much
time it would take to eat grapes as
opposed to how much time it would uh
take to eat a coconut it's clear that
it's going to take longer to eat a
coconut because there's more effort
involved so we have a sense that it's
going to take more time but comparing
the coconut to our basine of two right
we came up with a Baseline of two for
the smallest user Story We compare
eating coconuts to that Baseline and we
say okay you know what it's going to
take more effort to uh eat the coconut
than it is to eat grapes or
apples um so you can do it like we did
you can also
triangulate um for example when we did
our planning project this morning or
this morning for me rather at the
beginning
um oh that's not it that is the daily
standup here it
is if I had said Team I want you to pick
a small user story a medium user story
and a large user
story um and then we would then compare
other stories to those three and so we
would kind of triangulate on it um let's
say that we did uh you know two was
small uh I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong
grapes was small apples were medium and
coconuts were large well if we then
looked at Orange and we said well you
know orange
is um smaller than Apples but bigger
than grapes so we would know this would
fit in between grapes and
apples
um and so let's say you know we had
apples at five and grapes at two then we
would say an orange is probably going to
be three
and the values you know now I used um in
our example the modified Fibonacci
series uh what we do in scrum and Adel
if we're using story points we're going
to use um a nonlinear scale for the
values so down at the
bottom here there's the modified
Fibonacci Sequence the way the Fibonacci
sequence works by the way
um um it's
the the value is the sum of the two on
the right so let me break this right
here because this is a modified
Fibonacci so 13 is 5 + 8 8 is 3 + 5 5 is
2+ 3 and 3 is 1 + 2 if we were doing the
real Fibonacci series this wouldn't be
20 it would be 13 + 8 which would be
21 um and I don't know why some use
modified Fibonacci and others not but
that's just kind of a common thing to do
if you're doing planning poker you give
everybody seven cards 1 two 3 5 8 13 and
20 um another nonlinear scale is
doubling one
12486 um you typically don't go too far
to the left with the values because um
that either means that you're being too
granular or you've got stories that are
probably too big and they need to be
disaggregated
now somebody just chatted here um should
some buffer time be included in the
actual
estimates
um let me answer that question first by
going back to Ideal time and then I'm
going to come back to story points and
answer the question when we're
estimating in ideal time we don't add a
special amount of time that we would
call a buffer we just allow for the
distractions and the interruptions which
could look like a buffer right you're
saying you know um you know Priyanka if
um based on your duties in the
organization and our uh work day of
eight hours you're typically available
to be doing your project work five out
of those eight hours so when we are
converting ideal time to elapse time um
you know we will be building in extra
time based on distractions and
interruptions we would not call it a
buffer but that's essentially what we're
doing now when it comes to user stories
that we're using story points it is
different um the points are for the
entire amount of the work and why might
we need to have some extra time for a
user story well it's likely going to be
driven by uncertainty there might be
other uh things that impact it but
that's the main thing
sorry
team so when the team is estimating the
size of the user story they will be
including in their discussion and
estimates any extra time or buffer time
that would be needed for uh that user
story to be completed so do we
accommodate um uncertainty when we're
using story points yes we're looking at
the The X Factor and if we've got an
unst able user story then we're probably
going to um say you know this is going
to be a bigger user story than one
that's similar but has a a much lesser
level of
uncertainty um so that's the story
points let's compare the
two um Ideal Time uses things like hours
and days which is easier to explain
outside the team right the suits like
things in days days and hours
everybody's estimate may be different
not a bad thing it's easier to do at the
beginning because we're oriented to
think about time um and it does kind of
shine a light on wasted time story
points um are harder to explain outside
the team um you know the suit says well
um how long is it going to take to do
user story 301 and our answer is um well
that's a 10 user story Point user story
and the suit saying what does that mean
tell me how long it's going to take um
so the suits have to be converted to uh
uh story points now here's the thing
it's a lot easier to get consensus when
we're estimating in story points and
once we get good at it it's going to be
much
faster we have to remember it's not
comparable across teams so you know a
team working together will have its own
kind of system for sizing the stories
and another team that might even be
working on the same project will have a
CO a whole different uh scheme and so if
the velocity of one team is 25 and the
velocity of another is 50 it doesn't
mean that the team with the velocity of
50 is able to do more work than the
teams whose velocity is
25 and we did um when we got our day
going um we started with um uh a
planning poker exercise and so you know
we used all of the team members so we
selected the team the product owner was
there to answer any questions um the
team discussed each of the story cards
and then um decided what their vote was
going to be and then everybody voted at
once if there were outliers they were
discussed and um the reasons for that uh
those variances those outliers um were
then part of the discussion and then we
did another round of voting and we would
keep doing that until we had our
estimates converge or we reached
consensus on
them okay so advantages of planning
poker it's fun it's quick it gets the
whole team involved the the team
understands um a little bit about all of
the stories everybody can contributes
his or her expertise and the discussion
during the estimation provides Clarity
in the direction approach and even a bit
of design if we were in the same room
team and we were doing a planning poker
activity like we did uh at the beginning
of our day uh together um we would be
able to you know model it a little bit
better or if we tried to unmute
everybody but you could hear the
background noise I've tried doing it it
doesn't really work but you get the idea
that if the team's discussing and things
like that you would actually get to the
point where um your estimates would
converge and the team would say okay
this user story size is you know
whatever it
is okay so we need to wrap things up for
the day so we are ending right here and
that means tomorrow when we get together
we're going to be doing slide 20 you're
starting with that which is Affinity
estimating and let's see Affinity
estimating we go through that we're
going to talk about tracking progress
using um information radiators and then
we're going to talk about what we do
when we find variances between the plan
and the actual results and then we'll
have our quiz now let's talk about the
values of scrum now this is different
than pillars this is um values so there
are five um values for that
and this is something that I want you to
memorize so I'm going to switch my
cameras here and go to the white
port and we're going to
add to our
list Oh wrong
color you can tell I'm a project manager
because that would bother
me so the
five values of
scrum and there's an acronym you you can
see that on the screen right C
Force okay so
five values of
scrum and c f o r
c and you kind of know my style here you
don't have to do it this way you know
whatever works for you but have some
kind of a strategy for memorizing things
will probably serve you
well so the um the first C is
commitment the next one there four four
F is
focus o is
openness is that two ends or one I don't
know openness
we'll blame it on the marker if it's not
right um R is for
respect and the last C
is
courage and so there's your little chart
right there and um let me just briefly
go over
these um none of these will be a big
surprise here um we've talked about some
of them already in one context or
another um so the for commitment that
means the commit the team is going to
commit to deliver value to the
customer um they're on board there's the
Buy in all of that's there Focus the
team is going to focus on the few
important
things
um at a time so we're going to do time
boxing uh we're not going to do things
broadly specific Ally uh focus on a few
things at a time o is openness that's
analogous to the T transparency and the
pillars meaning we're going to be
completely open in Sharing um
information about the project our own
opinions our fears our concerns Etc our
stands for respect and that's kind of a
360 view we respect ourselves we respect
others we respect the uh Concepts that
we are using as part of scrum and
um um and you and we respect the other
stakeholders as well 360 and the last SE
stands for courage and that's the
courage to make commitments uh even when
we're in an uncertain
environment
um courage to deal with um fear that
comes from a failure uh courage to uh
share disagreements openly yet
respectfully um courage to participate
in debating technical approaches
Etc okay so now let's go to the scrum
life cycle chart and what I want to do
is I want to elaborate on this just a
little
bit and I'm going to try and use my
mouse to do some some uh additions to
this um
first of all we have the product backlog
the product backlog has to be kept
current and we call that grooming
grooming is adding user stories and
removing user stories from the product
backlog product backlog is the scope of
the project the product owner owns that
the team assists in that effort related
to grooming is pruning pruning the
backlog is prioritizing and re
prioritizing so the product backlog is
pruned and groomed regularly throughout
the course of the project
now there is a meeting that takes place
right here which is called the
Sprint planning meeting can I just do
PSP here Sprint planning meeting okay
that is one of the ceremonies or events
that um
takes place in scrum in the um the
Sprint planning
meeting it is a Time booxed Event and it
is time boxed to two hours for each week
of the Sprint so in our example here we
have a 30-day Sprint so if we have a
4-week Sprint then our Sprint planning
meeting will be8 hours in
duration and two things happen during
the Sprint planning meeting
the user stories that are going to be
included in the Sprint are selected
right they're put into the Sprint
backlog which is a subset of the product
backlog containing the user stories that
are going to be completed during the
Sprint and the second thing that happens
during the Sprint planning meeting is
the selected user stories are then
disaggregated into tasks and
estimated once that that's done then the
work of the Sprint begins there will be
a daily scrum like we did at the
beginning of our work day together as
our team and then at the end of the work
of the uh Sprint there will be the
Sprint
review the Sprint review meeting or
ceremony is also time boxed and it is
time boxed to one
hour for each week of the Sprint so if
we're doing a 4-week Sprint the Sprint
review meeting would be 4 hours in
length the primary purpose of the review
is to Showcase and demo the software and
get feedback from relevant stakeholders
and allow the product owner to say I
accept or I reject the work that has
been
done then after that that is the Sprint
retrospective now this is where the
team asks and answers three questions
what went well what did not go well and
what are we going to do different going
forward regarding the previous Sprint
that was just completed and the ones
that is is just coming
up um and then the uh the Sprint itself
will result in in working software or
value for the customer and then of
course everything goes back and repeats
for as many Sprints uh as necessary to
complete the scope of the
project um let's see I see a chat here
how similar or different is a product
backlog to SRS software requirement
specs document which is widely used in
projects um it's different um and if you
will hang on to that question um we're
going to have a discussion later on
about user stories and that will help
you understand uh the differences um and
we'll get into the user stories that
come from the customer and user stories
that come from the text domain and that
will help answer your question so you
okay hanging on to
that okay great
thanks okay so um a little bit more
detailed view of the scrum Project Life
cycle now let's talk about a couple
other things here when it comes to um a
Sprint there are some things that affect
the duration of the Sprint so the team
is going to have to decide how long each
of the Sprints are going to be and
things that are a factor include the
stability of the product backlog If the
product backlog is changing a great deal
um then that's going to argue for
shorter
durations um because there's uh a high
level of uncertainty and so you have a
greater amount of control on your
project if you have shorter Sprints now
on the other hand another factor is the
cost of iterating every time we do a
Sprint there are costs associated with
the Sprint planning meeting the Sprint
review the Sprint retrospective right
people show up to those meeting you got
to pay them and um excuse me so there
there is an overhead cost to actually
doing sprints the goal of the Sprint is
working software at the end the end
product should be near releasable or
potentially shippable now there might be
working software that the product owner
isn't going to want to release um maybe
because it it as a standalone component
of working software for the system
doesn't create any value or any
usability for end users uh and maybe you
wait till the end of a release before
you release everything but the idea is
is it's working software and it could be
released if um the customer wanted to do
that
um sorry I just dropped something
I see a question there I will Circle
back to your question in just a sec um
the Sprint duration and deliverables do
not change once the team has committed
this is another one of those things that
has to be viewed as absolute when we're
doing scrum so if we say that we're
going to do a two- week Sprint and we
select five user stories based on our
velocity or capacity once that decision
has been made the duration of the Sprint
does not change and we do not add or
remove any user
stories now it could be possible for the
product owner to cancel a Sprint but
that would be extreme that would be
because there is such a major change to
the product backlog that the work of the
current Sprint is going to be completely
irrelevant you don't change the Sprint
you cancel the Sprint and then the
bottom one here the Sprint begins with
planning and ends with review in a
retrospective and there was a question
here are there any issues with combining
the retrospective and the planning
ceremonies and the answer to that is yes
now could they be combined depending on
the environment the answer is yes and
the way we would arrive at whether or
not it would make sense is who's going
to be
participating um but they would be
separate agendas so the agenda for the
retrospective is what went well what did
not go well what are we going to do
different and the mandatory participants
for that meeting are the the the team
the scrum team is the scrum Master going
to be there likely as a facilitator um
is the product owner going to be there
maybe maybe not if the product owner is
there you know the product owner could
maybe answer questions and help clarify
but the product owner does not weigh in
on what went well what did not go well
and what are we going to do differently
that is all owned by the team in the
planning meeting the product owner has
to be there and the product owner is the
main driver of that meeting um the
product owner is talking about or
dealing with the priority the user
Stories the team's weighing in maybe
there's some dependencies that need to
be considered but um the product owner
has to make the hard decisions with
regards to what's going to be done in
the next Sprint based on the constraints
from the team like velocity um and
technology and sequencing and things
like that so um I kind of answered that
from a real world point of view yes it
could be it's not desirable on the test
they are completely
separate I get you
there I'll keep my eye on the chat box
make sure I got that answered well
enough for you and let move
ahead okay the Sprint planning meeting
this is uh looking right down here this
is conducted at the beginning of a new
Sprint it's attended by the team the
product owner and the scrub master and
there are two approaches to deciding
what's going to be included in the
Sprint it can be based on commitment and
it can also be based on
velocity and the goal here is to get
team by in make sure that there is um
Clarity between the team and the product
owner as to what the definition of done
looks like for the user stories that are
going to be included in the
Sprint and um of course it should be
realistic and achievable and you know
there can be a little bit of of um an
issue where you've got you know a
well-meaning product owner that's
driving really hard and the team says
you know we can do these Sprints and the
product honor is saying no come on you
got to do at least one more I got to
have this one in this Sprint um you
could get a question like that and it
might be what would the scrub Master do
if you had a dominant product owner
that's trying to persuade the team to do
more than the team thinks it can
do um and that's where the scrub Master
comes in the scrum Master plays the role
of the mentor the coach and uh you know
assisting in the resolution of those
kinds of issues without deciding the
scrum Master is not a decider the team
decides uh when it comes to how and the
product owner decides when it comes to
what okay the scrum meeting uh daily
scrum we've talked about it right the
entire team attends the meeting could
the product owner be there yes does the
product owner need to be there no
sometimes the product owner can be uh
you know an impediment to the meeting um
but would be welcome but if the product
owner started asking questions or became
the focus of questions being asked uh
the scrum Master would have to help
facilitate a change because um that
would not be effective for the daily
scrum duration 15 minutes we talked
about that and the agenda what did I do
yesterday what am I going to do today
and what are my
impediments the Sprint review now who
attends it's going to be the team the
product owner the scrum master and
potentially others
so optionally others you know that we
would want to get feedback from would be
end users um operations folks the suits
um all of those would be welcome
depending on the relevance of the
software that's being demoed and being
um uh subject to the acceptance testing
and the product own or you know giving
the thumbs up or the thumbs down when it
comes to acceptance the duration for
this we mentioned this before it's not
just a flat two hours it's one hour per
week so if you did a four-week Sprint
you would plan on the review being a
maximum of four hours in duration the
agenda is to demo the completed software
get feedback and then see where we are
when it comes to the the release plan
the retrospective who is there it's
attended by the team and I would modify
this slightly and I would say this is
the the mandatory group that needs to be
there um optionally the scrum Master
would be there potentially you could
have an external facilitator the role of
the scrum Master would be the
facilitator now um a good scrum Master
being a facilitator in a retrospective
would have some knowledge of control
charts the five
y's um um Ishikawa diagrams things like
that and although the scrum Master would
not be participating in the actual use
of the tools the scrum Master would be
facilitating the effective use of those
tools um when it comes to duration the
rule is 45 minutes for each
week o that was a good four that was
kind of a lousy f
so if you had a uh two we um uh Sprint
then you would have an hour and a half
retrospective
Max and what's the purpose there's H the
agenda for the retrospective three
questions what worked well what did not
go well what are we going to do
different and it's not just a chat
session well that would be part of it
you will use tools and techniques um
like some that I mentioned control
charts um
Ishikawa
diagrams
um five wise there's a number of things
that you might use uh in order to
surface uh assignable causes for issues
so that we could then come up with a
resolution to
those um this is where continuous
Improvement um is uh going to happen um
you know continuous Improvement is the
result of other things but this is the
main main thing and if you were get a
question about the relevance or the
necessity of retrospectives there is no
equivocation you do a retrospective
after every Sprint um if you don't do a
retr um if you don't then um there's no
improvement um you know things just stay
static okay so we talked about the four
main ceremonies right in uh a scrum
project Sprint planning
you with me daily standup the Sprint
review and then the Sprint
retrospective all considered mandatory
for effectively doing scrum and not
doing them uh or one of them would be
considered a
sale okay artifacts that we use when it
comes to scrum uh we've talked about the
product backlog we talked about the
Sprint backlog there's also um a release
backlog uh depending on the size of the
project it might be advisable to uh
group user stories into releases um if
you have a product road map uh your
releases would line up for that um for
example I've got a um uh a real life
project that I'm working on and my
product road mapap is um um uh got three
versions it's a website um the first
version is free uh the second version
includes a membership component and the
third uh version includes um a referral
commission uh portion to it and so I
will then uh do three releases I'll have
all the user stories that will result in
version one all the the user stories
that result in version to so that's what
the release uh backlog is and so if you
look at it in sequence the product
backlog is the overall scope of the
project the release backlog is a subset
of the product backlog and then the
Sprint backlog would be a subset of the
release
backlog the product backlog might look
something like this um it's a list of
user stories that are written by the
product owner and are going to be
developed by the um team members and
didn't we have we had a product backlog
for the thing that we did this morning
right so here's another example of a
product backlog um this is more of a
list um and just has the title there
would be a user story card for each of
the items in the product
backlog um but the idea would be it
would would be prioritized uh there
could be user stories that are added or
removed depending on what the product
owner wants product owner owns the
product
backlog um that's a given uh does the
product owner create all the user
stories for the product backlog in
isolation no absolutely not because
there are technical considerations that
the product back or the product owner
might not um even consider the product
uh owner's perspective is more the
customer side the end user side um and
so the product owner might not even
think of things like security or
architecture related things um and there
might even be uh user stories that come
from the technical domain that need to
be uh developed before some of the uh
products owners user
stories another artifact is the
definition of done the definition of
done is primarily a
checklist and this is what forms the
agreement between the product owner and
the
team um as to when we consider something
completely
done and if we look down here it's um uh
where's my I'm looking for my cursor it
says here it's usually prepared by the
scrum master in consultation with the
team
um that is I would modify this slightly
um the definition of done is really
driven by the team the see the scrum
Master is never a decision maker if you
have a scrum Master that's saying we
have to have this in the definition of
done then that's an infringement on the
empowerment of the team I agree that
this the scrum Master is a part of of
the effort to develop the definition of
done um but I would kind of flip that uh
the scrum Masters the facilitator it's
the team that still um owns that so um
now is the product owner involved in
this absolutely because the product
owner is involved in defining the story
and what a fully implemented story looks
like so here's a
list a short list of what a definition
of done could look like the story has
been fully implemented or the code
completed as
described um automated unit tests have
been developed with at least 80% code
coverage um it could be more than that
um this is just an example automated
unit tests and acceptance tests of the
story are passing no severity has one or
two
defects and and then high priority test
cases have been automated and added to
the regression
Suite um the definition of done we point
out is likely to evolve as the team's
maturity increases as the project
advances there are three distinct roles
in scrum the scrum Master the product
owner and the development team the scrum
Master assists both the development team
and the product owner the scrum master
works with the product owner to maximize
return on
investment the scrum Master empowers the
development team by fostering creativity
removing impediments and coaching and
mentoring as appropriate the product
owner is responsible for project success
by defining the project Vision
requirements and
priorities the product owner has to
resist the temptation to manage the team
or add more important work after a
Sprint has begun
the product owner has to be willing to
make the hard choices during Sprint
planning the development team is
comprised of five to nine members with a
mix of roles and has the autonomy to
self-organize and choose how best to
meet the goals of the product owner and
is responsible for the same a scrum
Master is a skilled servant leader a
scrum master has very little formal
Authority however he or she is expected
to assist the team achieve the intended
outcomes without interfering with the
team's
autonomy the scrum Master facilitates
the scrum ceremonies such as Sprint
planning daily standup Sprint review and
Sprint
retrospective the scrum Master removes
obstacles or impediments faced by the
team the scrum Master is also a process
coach and Mentor the scrum Master must
not be a line manager of the team the
scrum Master is not to be a Taskmaster
either the scrum Master is not a
technical or design Authority nor is he
or she a decision maker for the team
throughout the course of the project the
scrum Master must not do anything to rob
the team of its empowerment and ability
to
self-organize let's talk about the
attributes of a scrum Master scrum
Masters need to exhibit responsibility
even though they are not solely
accountable for the team's output they
will consider it their responsibility to
remove anything that impacts the team's
productivity they will try to enable the
team to do the best that it
can they are
humble they will work in the background
and let the team take all the glory they
will use we statements and seldom use
any ey
statements they're able to set us aside
their ego and shower all their attention
on the
team they are by Nature collaborative
they will encourage the team to have
conversations among each other and with
other stakeholders outside the team they
will nudge all the right people into
getting involved and work together in
trying to solve problems they are
committed to the team cause even if
being a scrum Master is a part-time task
for them they will give the highest
priority to the team's needs hence the
scrum Masters work allocation especially
if they are part-time needs to take this
into
consideration they are able to influence
they are naturally good communicators
and able to convince others to adopt
different approaches they apply various
techniques to mobilize organizational
resources when required walk the
political tight rope when required and
in general do whatever it takes to get
the team the assistance it
needs they are
knowledgeable it is clear that as
process coaches for the team scrum
Masters need to be experts in the method
they may not be the technical or domain
experts however they are knowledgeable
enough to be able to have productive
conversations about the project being
done by the team tasks for the scrum
Master the scrum Master is a crucial
role and it is important for you to be
able to be clear clear about exactly how
the scrum Master serves the team scrum
Masters are servant leaders this means
that they put the team before themselves
and assist the team for example they set
up ensure that the scrum ceremonies are
effectively carried out they ensure that
there is smooth flow of information
within and outside the team and that
there is a spirit of collaboration in
decision- making and problem solving
scrum Masters must make it their mission
to resolve issues that hinder team
progress it doesn't matter what the
nature of the issue is a scrum Master
needs to mobilize the right resources
within the organization to resolve those
issues in a timely manner and escalate
promptly if that does not
happen we need to understand that in the
short duration of a Sprint even a few
hours of being stuck can make the
difference between a successful and
unsuccessful
Sprint scrum Masters protect the team
they ensure that the team is not
Disturbed or asked to deviate from their
commitments if pressure mounts due to
unreasonable expectations they will step
in and push back on the team's behalf
they will also play the role of
Peacemaker when conflict arises by
encouraging the parties to focus on the
issue discuss the issue with an open
mind and resolve the conflict lict
finally scrum Masters are the process
coaches of the team they use their
understanding of agile methods and scrum
in particular to guide the team through
the dos and don'ts of
scrum they ensure that the team stays
true to the principles of Agile
development scrum Master roles scrum
teams before we discuss the role of a
developer on a scrum team let's talk
about the desirable characteristics of
scrum
teams they should be small and Nimble
team size should be no less than three
and no more than nine so that would be
six plus or minus three exceptions are
possible but
uncommon the small attribute makes the
team Nimble and improves productivity it
avoids the phenomenon Mike con calls
social loafing and instead produces
focus on work the team size should be
just large enough that the team members
are able to produce and showcase a
significant increment of work at the end
of each Sprint Sprint after
Sprint self-sufficient and cross
functional for example if a team needs
user interface development skills
database expertise and service expertise
all of those skills must be present on
the
team I ideally team members are
generalizing Specialists team members
should not only be an expert or a
specialist at one aspect of the
development effort but should also have
enough skills and knowledge to fill in
in other roles as necessary for example
if you are a UI developer you should be
able to Dawn the Hat of a Services
developer if
needed if a large team is to be split up
into smaller scrum teams scrum favors
feature teams over component
teams autonomous and
self-organizing teams choose for
themselves how they are going to
organize and meet the goals of the
product owner no one gets to dictate to
the team how to get their work
done the team decides in collaboration
with the product owner the project
Direction and the pros and cons of
different
approaches let's talk about some key
decision points or factors to consider
when assembling scrum teams feature
teams over component teams the first
issue is whether it's best to align team
members based on features or components
scrum favors feature teams over
component teams for example it's best to
avoid putting all of the UI developers
together and all of the API or Services
developers together why because each
feature or user story will require both
the the UI and services or API
organizing based on components will
reduce the incentive to collaborate the
only reason component teams may be
justified would be if the components are
likely to be used by multiple other
teams assemble the right people it's
important to get the right mix of people
together for the team the right level of
Technical and domain expertise teams
will naturally have both senior and
junior level devel Vel opers this works
perfectly as there will be stuff that is
more appropriate for the junior
developers and stuff that is not also
one of the risks of a small team is that
the team may miss out on broader
perspective and dissenting views one way
to work around this is to deliberately
favor diversity in all aspects gender
ethnicity personality traits Etc it may
take some time for the team to advance
through the storming stage of Team
development
and develop the trust necessary to work
effectively together but it can be done
once a team has been formed it's best to
preserve and assign whole teams rather
than individuals to
projects it's best to avoid assigning
team members to multiple projects at the
same
time distributed team a distributed team
may be
unavoidable those based at the same
geographical location should be
collocated in the same team room and
Technology processes and ground rules
should be put in place to overcome the
disadvantages of all team members not
being
collocated plotting team size and
productivity will likely result in an S
curve you can see here that a team can
actually be too small or too large
Remember The Sweet Spot is six plus or
minus
3 think of scrum as a lightweight
framework that utilizes principles and
practices that assist teams in
delivering working software in short
Cycles to the customer enabling rapid
feedback continuous Improvement and
quick response to
change it promotes delivering value as
in working software to the customer in
an incremental and iterative way it is
not a process or technique for
developing software rather it is a
framework within which various processes
techniques and practices are employed in
scrum the iterations that deliver
working software to the customer are
called
Sprints in each iteration or sprint
results in potentially shippable
software this slide is a graphical
representation of an agile project using
scrum starting at the left you can see
that the product owner owns the product
backlog and in collaboration with the
team develops the user stories or
requirements for the project the product
backlog is prioritized with the higher
priority items occupying the top of the
product
backlog in collaboration with the
product owner the team decides how to
group the user stories into releases
based on the product road
map once the release planning has been
completed the user stories are selected
for a
Sprint the duration of the Sprint is
going to be 2 to 4 weeks once the Sprint
backlog has been determined the team
then disaggregates each user story into
tasks during each Sprint the user
stories are
developed as the code is written it is
integrated into the system and daily
scrums are held at the end of a Sprint
there is a Sprint review where the
working software is demonstrated and
presented to the customer for acceptance
the team then conducts a Sprint
retrospective during the retrospective
the team looks at primarily three things
what went well what did not go well and
what should be done differently going
forward the team velocity is then
updated as are the information radiators
which transparently display the status
and progress of the project and then the
cycle repeats itself until the project
is
complete a Sprint is an iteration in
scrum at the beginning of a project the
scrum team determines the duration of
Sprints for the project most Sprints are
going to be two to four weeks in
duration factors affecting Sprint
duration include the stability of the
product backlog once a Sprint has begun
the duration is never changed nor are
any user stories added or removed
therefore if many changes are expected a
shorter Sprint duration would be best
however if the product backlog is
relatively stable a longer Sprint
duration may be
appropriate overhead there are overhead
costs associated with each Sprint for
example every Sprint's going to have a
Sprint planning meeting a Sprint review
and a Sprint
retrospective if a team has been able to
lower these overhead costs by automated
testing continuous integration Etc these
costs can be absorbed more easily making
shorter Sprints more desirable
however if these overhead costs remain
high the team may need to use longer
duration
Sprints a team may be tempted to extend
the duration of Sprints in an effort to
hide their
inefficiencies
remember agile projects favor shorter
duration Sprints and it is the scrum
Master's responsibility to coach and
Mentor the team so it can reduce waste
irregularities and overuse and make the
Sprint shorter the goal of a Sprint is
to deliver working software at the
conclusion of each Sprint the team
should be able to deliver near
releasable or potentially shippable
software this is not easy especially for
an existing product with a lot of Legacy
features but it can be done with the
right technical practices and mature
development processes once the Sprint
duration has been determined and the
user stories for the Sprint have been
selected the duration of the Sprint
cannot be altered nor can any user story
be added or removed the Sprint will end
at the appointed time irrespective of
whether the team has met the Sprint
goals or not this allows for Effective
continuous Improvement if the team is
unable to deliver the working software
as planned the team will have to figure
out why that happened and then make
changes to improve going
forward the product owner may choose to
cancel or terminate a Sprint in specific
situations for for example a significant
change in priorities or a mid-course
correction May render the current Sprint
backlog
invalid given that we are only talking
about a couple of weeks of work the
cancellation of a Sprint would be an
extremely rare
event a Sprint will begin with a Sprint
planning meeting and end with a Sprint
review and
retrospective there are three backlogs
used in scrum the product backlog the
release backlog and the Sprint backlog
the product backlog is the master
container of all the user stories for
the project the product backlog is
continually pruned or prioritized so
that maximum value is delivered to the
customer the release backlog is a subset
of the product backlog releases support
the product road map and each release is
populated with user stories necessary
for that release the Sprint backlog is a
subset of the release backlog and
contains the user stories to be
developed in the Sprint as we said the
product backlog contains the user
stories for the entire project and it is
the responsibility of the product owner
user stories are features functions or
requirements that deliver value to the
customer however the product backlog
will also have to contain technical or
non-functional user stories necessary
for the system to work properly the
product backlog may also include risk or
defect related users Stories the product
owner is responsible for keeping the
product backlog current and up to dat
this is accomplished by pruning the
backlog which is prioritizing and
reprioritizing the product backlog must
also be continually groomed this is the
process of adding and removing user
stories based on the needs and desires
of the customer there are four scrum
ceremonies the Sprint planning meeting
the daily scrum the Sprint review and
the Sprint
retrospective let's take a detailed look
at each of these ceremonies the Sprint
planning meeting is time boxed at two
hours for each week of the Sprint if the
Sprint is going to be two weeks in
duration then the time box will be 4
hours if the Sprint is going to be four
weeks in duration then the time box for
the Sprint planning meeting will be
eight hours it should be attended by the
complete scrum team including all roles
the most important aspects of this
meeting are the team's capacity and the
definition of
done there are two approaches to
selecting user stories for a Sprint one
is based on the velocity of the team the
other is commitment driven team Buy in
is critical and the goals of the Sprint
should be clearly understood and the
desired outcome should be clearly
articulated with the definition of done
then there's the daily scrum
the time box for the daily scrum is 15
minutes regardless of the duration of
the Sprint length the entire scrum team
including all roles should attend the
daily scrum each development team member
individually answers three questions
what did I do yesterday what am I going
to do today and what are my
impediments this is how the team members
coordinate their work and the scrum
Master learns of the impediments he or
she should be taken care of the Sprint
review takes place at the end of the
Sprint and is time boxed at one hour for
each week of the Sprint so if the Sprint
were four weeks in duration the Sprint
review meeting would be four
hours it should be attended by the
complete scrum team including all roles
plus any other stakeholders who are
interested in project
success the purpose of the review is to
demonstrate working soft Ware and obtain
and assess
feedback feedback May range from Full
acceptance of the completed software to
complete
rejection the Sprint retrospective takes
place after the conclusion of the Sprint
review and is time boxed at 45 minutes
for each week of the
Sprint so if the Sprint has two weeks in
duration then the retrospective would be
1 and 1/2 hours in length it should be
attended by the complete scrum team
including all
roles however the product owner's
attendance is considered
optional during the retrospective the
team answers four
questions what worked well what did not
work
well what should be done
differently and what still puzzles
us one or several problem detection
techniques may be used in the
retrospectives and this ceremony is a
vital part of continuous impr
Improvement at the conclusion of the
retrospective the teams of velocity and
the Project's information radiators are
updated then the next Sprint planning
meeting takes place and this cycle
continues until the project is complete
the definition of done is an important
artifact for a scrum team it is the
primary reporting mechanism for team
members and there may be a different
definition of dun at various levels
definition of dun for a feature or user
Story the definition of done for a
Sprint and the definition of done for a
release it's really just a checklist of
activities that add verifiable and
demonstrable value to the product it's
created by the scrum master in
consultation with the team a sample list
of the items for the definition of done
criteria is given here the story is
fully implemented or code completed as
described automated unit tests have been
developed with at least 80% code
coverage automated unit test and
acceptance tests in the story are
passing high priority test cases have
been automated and added to the
regression
Suite note this is only meant to be an
example each team's definition of done
will vary slightly depending on the
maturity of the team and the specific
situation of the team
the product team has taken up a new
project called WeatherMaster the team is
planning to move to scrum methodology
and this is an outline of its first
scrum meeting time box to 15 minutes
Rick is the scrum master of this meeting
where the team members discuss what they
did yesterday their plans for today and
the impediments they faced all team
members are standing up including Todd
who's joined the meeting via video chat
Rick holds the meeting near a scrum
board Angela the product owner is absent
Rick reiterates that all discussions
would be parked until after the scrum
meeting and encourages his team to keep
the meeting short people can chime in to
resolve
obstacles hi team welcome to the Daily
standup meeting for the product team on
Project WeatherMaster we are in Sprint
one and today is the second day as we
are planning to transition to scrum
methodology I hope you will find this
daily standup meeting helpful in this
meeting you will provide information
about what you did yesterday what you
plan to do today and what challenges you
faced I think everyone's here let's
start I don't see Angela shouldn't she
be here I did add Angela as an optional
attendee to this meeting and since she
hasn't showed up we don't have to wait
for her
Susan scrum doesn't provide a specific
yes or no about the product owner's
participation in the daily scrum the
Po's primary role is to provide
Direction and clarify requirements and
priorities since we don't always discuss
those in detail at this meeting the PO
is not required to be here if the POS
want to attend they are generally in
listen only mode for the duration of the
meeting they can use the information
gathered during the meeting for separate
offline conversations
[Music]
[Music]
what about Todd he works from his home
office right Todd will be a part of the
meeting through video chat it is
important that we include every team
member in the
meeting hi Todd how are you I'm fine
thanks am I audible yes Todd team let's
all stand up for the meeting
[Music]
[Music]
why don't you go first
Aaron yesterday I was working on
creating the mock objects to mask the
database calls from the unit tests the
difficulty with this approach is that
our server side logic is so dependent on
the metadata that writing a true mock is
a mammoth exercise there are decisions
that are taken during runtime based on
the data some of the stored procedure
calls are also made based on the values
returned through in queries that are
also embedded in the
code I was debugging the code until
about 900 p.m. but for the life of me I
couldn't figure this out Aaron could we
request you to be concise when you
provide an update if you think some of
the details you describe might be
interesting to others why don't you
write a Wiki page on it and share the
link so getting back to your update did
you finish the task
yesterday no it turned out to be much
more complex than I had imagined I'll
continue to work on it today and see if
I I can figure out an XML structure to
mock the schema and hardcode some return
values but I am really stuck as far as
the inline queries are
concerned I know what you're talking
about there is a reason why the inline
queries are there in the
code this is mainly for performance
reasons when the overheads of making a
procedure call based on a metadata value
and then processing the sorry for the
interruption again guys this is a really
great conversation may I suggest we
write this issue in the parking lot
I'm not sure what you mean by that Rick
let me explain what Aaron just brought
up is a blocking issue team members
should bring these up during the daily
scrum so that everybody knows that one
of the team members is stuck however the
daily scrum is not necessarily the
meeting where solutions to every
obstacle can or should be found it looks
like Mary knows a thing or two about the
issue that Aaron has brought up let's
jot this down as a parking lot topic
this means the team can have offline
conversations after the daily scrum to
track it
down I'm also going to make a note that
will track the impediment Aaron fac
daily until it is removed you should let
me know if I can help in any way right
Aaron is there anything else you would
like to say no I am done
thanks yesterday I worked on developing
the Wizards for bulk order creation I'm
almost done today I need to write code
to handle some of the exception
scenarios before I can get them over to
Susan for testing that's if for me I
guess did you forget to mention any
impediments not really an impediment at
present but I would like to mention that
my computer probably needs to be
upgraded with more RAM it has been slow
for the past few
weeks okay I wrote up some scenarios to
test the book order wizard I'm looking
to get my hands on the code as soon as
Mary is done today I'm also hoping to
complete the company order testing that
has been pending for a while I'm okay
for the moment but I do have one
question shouldn't we all be updating
the taskboard as we
speak we could it is up to you guys if
you think you want to do this during the
meeting if you ask my opinion we should
update the board as soon as we are ready
to move the tasks and not wait for the
meeting this will ensure that the board
is always up to date and also that we
use the meeting time to focus on the
conversations that's a great point Rick
I can't see the board very well from
here anyway so maybe we should find a
way to create an electronic version of
it too at some
point great Point Todd why don't you go
next with your updates all right hey
Rick would you like to know about my
work on the advertising module first or
the integration server whatever the team
decides is fine with me remember this is
really your meeting and I'm only here to
facilitate and ensure we get the most
out of this meeting
[Music]
[Music]
all right then I guess I'll start with
the integration server I would like to
inform everybody that I manag to set up
the integration server that we can use
as a Sandbox to test the code before
checking it in Source control I'll send
everybody a link with some instructions
and credentials I have also started
looking at the stories for the
advertising module it looks like there
are a lot of open statements in the
stores that I don't really understand I
guess I should have been paying more
attention during the Sprint planning I
really need to have a conversation with
Angela about this that is my main
impediment right now I sent her an email
but haven't received a response
yet I don't have anything new to add
today I'm almost through with setting up
our project on the freeware tool that I
downloaded yesterday I'll show you guys
a demo in the meeting I set up later
today I'll try to chase down some of
these parking lot items anything else
before we close the meeting
all right that's it for today have a
great day do you have a moment to chat
about the inline queries real quick the
purpose of a scrum meeting is to keep
the team members updated and resolve any
impediments it's an ideal way to
Kickstart the day on a positive note the
scrum Master reinforces the sense of the
self-managing team facilitates
communication between team members
brings the team's Focus back to what's
important and supports
Improvement so before we dive into the
differences between scrum and Canan
let's have a look at what exactly scrum
is Scrum is a simple agile project
management framework that is used by
organizations to help teams collaborate
handle
unpredictability and complex projects or
products while ensuring the products
delivered are of the highest value it
describes a set of meetings tools and
roles that enable teams to work in sync
and help them structure themselves and
manage their work scrum is one of those
things that's really easy to understand
but very difficult to master and
although scrum is seen to be used
generally by software development teams
its principles and themes are pretty
Universal and can be used with just
about all kinds of
teamwork with scrum teams are able to
learn from their
experiences what worked out what didn't
and things like that they're also able
to organize themselves to handle their
problems effectively and basically
improve themselves by reflecting on
them so how does scrum
work here we have the first component
the product backlog the product backlog
consists of a list of tasks that need to
be completed so that the goals of the
stakeholders are
achieved then the team decides what
tasks from the product backlog they want
to take up and deliver in a 2 to 4 week
period called Sprint hence the name
Sprint
planning next the tasks that were
discussed in the previous phase are
added to the Sprint backlog this is a
set of tasks which will be focused on in
the ongoing
Sprint following this the scrum team
which is usually to9 members strong will
work on these
tasks now they also have regular scrum
meetings where they talk about their
victories the issues they face and what
they plan to do in the next 24
hours and then they have the Sprint
review the Sprint review is a meeting
during which the team shows what they
accomplished during the Sprint now
during this time questions are asked
observations feedback and suggestions
are made the product owner also gets
feedback for upcoming Sprints from
stakeholders they also have a Sprint
retrospective now during this session
past mistakes potential issues and new
ways to handle them are
identified data from here is
incorporated into the new Sprint
plan the final step is increment here a
workable and usable output is provided
to the
stakeholders so now that we know how
scrum Works let's have a look at
Canan Canan comes from the Japanese word
can bam which literally means
signboard like scrum Canan is a popular
agile framework that is a visual system
by which the work can be managed with
ease as it progresses
Canan uses something known as the can
ban board to make these things
possible with this you can easily
identify bottlenecks and then fix them
cost effectively at optimal
speeds the main focus with Canan is
transparency since everything related to
the tasks are on the board everyone can
keep themselves updated it also ensures
that teams focus on their current tasks
until until they're done this limits the
amount of work that's in
progress so on the can band board work
is divided into smaller more manageable
pieces the work that's needed to be done
is written on a note or card and placed
on a board columns on the board help
represent where each item is with
respect to the workflow now let's have a
look at what these are in
detail let's find out how Canan
works now the board consists of three
major
components there's the to-do list which
represents items that need to be
completed the ongoing column which
represents items that are being
currently worked on and the completed or
the done column now these represent
tasks or items that have already been
completed now although this is a
physical representation of the board
several organizations use software
versions of the board that replaces the
sticky notes with cards that can be
moved from one column to another as work
progresses now an example of such a
software is Trello so if you want to
learn more about Trello you can check
out the link I'll be adding to the live
chat in a
moment at this point you guys must have
realized how similar these two
Frameworks sound
so let's run through some more of their
similarities let's find out how they are
similar firstly they both have
principles of lean and agile which means
reduction of waste and both of them are
time boxed and iterative approaches that
enable product delivery in an
incremental
manner both these Frameworks aim to
reduce the amount of work in progress
this forces the teams to ensure that
they focus on a smaller set of tasks
this also makes blockers and bottlenecks
a little more
visible in both cases the work is
divided into smaller more manageable
units both of these Frameworks use pull
scheduling now this means the products
are only Built based on demand rather
than
forecasts trans transparency plays a
major role in both these Frameworks by
helping them Drive process
Improvement and in both cases the
release plan is continuously optimized
and finally both these methods aim to
deliver releasable software often and
earlier than
expected so now that we've reached
Midway let me ask you guys a
question do you guys use scrum or cband
in your workplace or do you use these
software for personal reason reasons
what exactly do you use these for let me
know in the live
chat now let's have a look at how these
two Frameworks are different from one
another firstly let's have a look at
Cadence Cadence refers to the amount of
time in a Sprint or before a release so
when it comes to scrum the entire
project is divided into time constrained
iterations that is into smaller
manageable
units but when it comes to can ban it's
event
driven next criteria we're going to have
a look
at is release
methodology in scrum releases take place
after each Sprint which usually takes 2
to 4 weeks to complete for Canan
releases take place in the form of
continuous delivery they happen in such
a way that changes like new features
configuration change
bug fixes and experiments get to the
users in a safe quick and sustainable
manner next up let's have a look at how
changes are addressed in both these
Frameworks in scrum no change can be
made while the Sprint is in
progress once it's complete changes can
be considered in the Sprint plan and
then added to the Sprint
backlog with Canan changes can be made
made at any time and incorporated into
the
workflow now let's consider the metric
that's being measured in scrum for
planning and process Improvement
velocity which is the measure of the
work that can be completed by a team in
a Sprint is the key
metric in Canan lead time is the key
metric this represents the period of
time between a new tasks appearance in
your workflow and its final departure
from the system
next let's have a look at how teams work
in these Frameworks in scrum you need a
cross functional team to achieve your
goals in a Sprint in Canan cross
functional teams are optional but
specialized teams that focus on
particular aspects of the workflow are
required now let's talk about new
additions in scrum just like handling
changes you can't add any items between
a Sprint or an
iteration in canand new items can be
added to the board as long as there's
capacity available for
it now let's have a look at the job
roles Within These Frameworks scrum has
three major job roles product owner
scrum master and scrum team with Canan
you don't have any specific job
roles now let's talk about rep
representation or moreover let's talk
about how data can be
represented with scrum the Board needs
to be reset once a particular Sprint is
complete with Canan the board stays
persistent throughout the entirety of
the
project and finally let's have a look at
project link with scrum it's better
suited for longer
projects and with Canan projects that
can be completed in a shorter period of
time are
better so which one should you
choose now selecting from these two
methods is mainly based on the
requirements of the team do you expect
your project to be shorter do you want
to make changes at any time you don't
want to set up job specific roles then
can ban is the framework for you or do
you want a long running project with
different job roles and involving cross
functional teams scrum is the answer for
you based on the differences we
discussed in the last topic you can make
an informed
decision now let's have a look at some
of the popular companies around the
world that employ both these
Frameworks some of the companies that
have successfully implemented scrum are
Facebook General electronics and
Adobe companies that have implemented
ganban are seens BBC and sap thank you
