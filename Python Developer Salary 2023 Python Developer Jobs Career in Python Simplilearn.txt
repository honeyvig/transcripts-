Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply learn in this video session we
will be talking about python developer
salary
we will start with who is python
developer
then python developer job Trends in 2023
then we will cover python developer
salary and at last we will understand
why are python developers paid so much
now before moving forward let me ask you
a quick question so what is the main
reason behind the high demand for python
developer
option is companies are switching to
networking and AI domains option b is
python is an easy to learn programming
language option C is python developers
are known for their problem solving
skills and option D is python has large
community and extensive libraries now
you can pause this video and answer in
the comment section
all right now let's move on to the first
topic which is who is a python developer
so in simple terms a python developer is
someone who uses their expertise in
Python programming language to create
and maintain software applications
they have a set of responsibilities that
revolve around writing and organizing
code to make programs work smoothly
imagine you have a puzzle and you need
someone to put all the pieces together
to create a complete picture
that's what a python developer does with
the gold they take small bits of
instructions and arrange them in a way
that makes sense to the computer
their role is to understand the needs of
the project and design the software
accordingly
they write code using Python's special
rules and commands ensuring that
everything works correctly and
efficiently
python developers also test their code
find and fix any errors or bugs they
collaborate with other team members like
designers and project managers to make
sure the software meets the requirements
and functions properly so this was about
python developer now let's understand
python developer job Trends in 2023
so python a widely used programming
language has gained immense popularity
among developers worldwide
due to its versatility and diverse
applications in India alone there was
significant demand for python developers
with more than 75 000 open job positions
reported by naukri.com additionally
approximately 7000 job opportunities
specifically for python web developers
were available around the same time as
stated by analytics Insight several key
python development Trends are projected
to dominate the technology industry in
2023. these Trends include
data science Python's robust libraries
and tools make it well suited for data
analysis and modeling solidifying its
position as a leading Trend in this
field second is framework upgrades
popular Frameworks like Django and flask
are expected to undergo enhancements
improving their efficiency and user
friendliness for more effective
application development next is web and
mobile application development
python will continue to be a preferred
choice for building scalable and
feature-rich applications across web and
mobile platforms due to its versatility
and extensive Library support
fourth is cloud computing and python
as a cloud computing adoption Rises
Python's compatibility with major Cloud
platforms and its Rich set of libraries
for cloud related tasks position it as a
valuable tool for developing cloud-based
Solutions at number 5 there is
artificial intelligence and machine
learning applications
python Simplicity vast machine learning
libraries and Frameworks like tensorflow
and pythons make it language for choice
for AA and ml development a trend
expected to persist in 2023 next is
growing significance of python in
Academia python is increasingly utilized
in Academia for scientific Computing
data analysis and research purposes
driven by its versatility readability
and extensive Community Support
last is Automation and robotization
the demand for python developers is
anticipated to rise in 2023 due to
increased Automation and robotization
with python Simplicity and availability
of automation libraries making it
suitable for developing robotic process
automation Solutions across Industries
so these were some job trends of python
developer in 2023
now let's move on to the exciting part
that is python developer salary
the salary range of a python developer
can vary based on factors such as
experience skill set specialization
company size and location sync up to
date with industry Trends and
continuously enhancing one's skill can
lead to a higher earning potential in
this in demand field the salary range
for a python developers in India varies
based on experience in India a python
developer with one year of experience
can expect a salary ranging from 2.4 to
6 LBA for developers with more
experience such as two to three years
the salary range increases to 2.8 to 9.1
LPA and for those with four years of
experience the salary range expands
further to 4 to 13 lakh per annum as per
emission box these figures reflect the
average salary levels for python
developers in India based on their years
of experience Based on data from indeed
the salary of an entry-level python
developer in the United States is
approximately 65 000 annually equivalent
to 30.7 per hour for mid-level python
developers the average salary is around
82 000 per year that is 38.8 per hour
and experienced python developers on the
other hand earn an average of one
hundred and fourteen thousand dollars
per year so these were the python
developer salaries
now let's understand why python
developers are paid so much
so why are python developer paid so much
the python developers are high in demand
which is why they are being paid
significant amounts this is because
companies are increasingly focusing on
networking and AI domains and they
require skill developers proficient in
Python to work in these areas as the
popularity of these fields continues to
grow companies seize them as avenues for
potential expansion and success
consequently employers are eager to
recruit the most talented python
developers available in order to stay
competitive the strong demand for these
developers has led to employees offering
lucrative compensation packages as an
incentive to attract and retain top
talent in the industry so if you're
someone who is interested in building a
career in artificial intelligence and
machine learning by graduating from the
best universities or a professional who
choose to switch career with artificial
intelligence by learning from experts
then try giving a shot at simplylearn's
postgraduate program in artificial
intelligence from the Purdue University
in collaboration with IBM
