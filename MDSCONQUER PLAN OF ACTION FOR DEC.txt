yeah hi as parents and now I'm just
going to give a brief idea of our plan
for the month of December okay so
basically in December we have we are
planning to cover two important subjects
okay one is general materials and second
one is prosthetics okay to be a part of
this
you can add implants also okay
meaningful implants has to be covered
from four point of views one is material
aspect will be covered in dental
materials prosthetic aspart will be
covered in prosthodontics okay whereas
your surgical aspects will be covered in
oral surgery and your periodontal
aspects will be covered in period so
it's an important topic and an important
area not only in the clinical dentistry
right now in the market but also in
examination point of view because if you
analyze the recent papers of both aims
need VGA or chip man you have a decent
number of questions of course you have
one or two questions at any cost the
minimum is one or two questions at any
cost from this great area okay so you
need to learn implants at your best so
dental materials the good aspect of
dental materials according to the need
blueprint is 14 marks and your
prosthetics which is again three to four
parts which is going to carry 14 marks
okay and diem is not only covered in in
prosthetic point of view okay a few
areas of diem will be covered in comes
away too few areas will be covered in
end or few areas will be covered in pedo
few areas will be covered in earthquakes
why should because in in in our
preparation also in our shaded also I
have given some time for orthodontics
dental materials you can you can see the
rest also includes dental materials from
other subjects like a simple word what
is dental materials materials that are
used in dentistry or materials that are
deal in almost all the departments okay
so
dental material question can be anywhere
in specification need has given 14 marks
but I feel like it is going to carry
more than 14 plus for sure because every
subject they have ten Tomatoes for
example if you take your oral surgical
general surgery
you have your suturing material that
material is also called as knit into
material question okay so you have will
have definitely more than 14 marks and
prosthetics of course is again four
parts okay one is complete denture Maxo
facial danger Maxo facial processes okay
art P D and F P D okay so these are the
areas where we have to focus on and we
have to get prepared and coming to the
mode of preparation I have given
beautifully given the schedule up to 27
December followed by you how two days of
revision in middle you have again three
more days so three plus two it's a five
days revision plan and if you are able
to complete the syllabus on time you
will have minimum five days for the
revision and if you are able to complete
the syllabus in prior okay going fast
with the schedule then you will have
more time for revision and revision is
mandatory to take your exam on 30th
December so areas where you need to
focus for dental materials okay then to
metal this is more of numericals okay
less of concepts and more of numericals
and more is of memory based stuff okay
you will have more memory based stuff so
I feel like you should use your memory
and you have to strain your brain with
the numericals of dental materials I
mean few things can be directly
discussed on the group from a textbook
that is Phillips you can keep Phillips
the only book for dental materials
questions is until Phillips so please
don't keep all low end or Yugi level
books go for the Phillips if you want to
have a textbook reading go for it most
of the textbook reading which is really
required for the examination will be
covered of the group don't worry will be
covered all the videos don't worry about
that but you need to give importance to
the textbook reading and numericals and
memory based concepts will be more in
dental materials okay so coming to the
prosthetics of course you can stick on
to the dental pulse and dentist for
prosthetics that is more than sufficient
no need to add any other book there is
one more book that is released by the
swapna publication
for the prosthetics okay I'm going to
post the pic of that particular group on
the group but you'll pick up that
particular book on the group if people
who are interested for a mess or any
high-end examinations like PJ or Jim are
in specific you need to solve that book
so that you will be in a good show or
you'll be in a satisfactory tone to
answer the best number of questions from
the subject prosthetics okay so
basically first you need to finish the
pulse followed by the dentist and if you
have time and if you are interested to
work hard then the extra book is that
Swapna publications dental materials and
prosthetics they have released one book
two years back that book is good good
enough to solve many questions and many
concepts which are really missing in the
pulse and the dentist okay so that's all
about that and more important should be
given to the topics like max of facial
processes or the materials are used in
the max of facial processes and pre
prosthetic surgery because these I feel
like these topics are like faded or not
covered at the best in the in the in the
in the basic mcq books but if you see
into the examination or if you go
through the 2017 18 19 and the recent
papers you will have a decent number of
questions over this topic so this topics
if possible should be done from the
textbook okay so other most important
topics are again the implants not only
implants from the prosthetic point of
view you have implants you have human
body implants I mean I have seen
questions of the breast implants also so
you need to learn every implant area
even micro implants like those are used
in the case of your orthodontics you
can't see 2019 question pepper of meat
there is a question on micro implants
which are used in orthodontics right so
all all related stuff related to the
implant from from the first point to the
last point everything has to be done at
the best because these are new things
okay you can add a dye material this is
specifically a new topic you need to
give more importance dental ceramics
which is one of the toughest topic
biomaterial and biocompatibility is
again a new topic which is missing in
the basic books you're soldering welding
all these are extra things that has to
be done from the textbook preferably on
that particular day I just want to give
the order of things that you have to do
okay first of all you need to check the
group task that is posted on the day or
you need to check the schedule so once
you're done with that I want you guys to
finish dental pulse part of that
particular topic followed by the dentist
of the same topic then followed by if
you want you can do that swapna
publication prosthetics and dental
materials
once you are done with this if you have
time then go with the textbook reading
and preferably textbook reading is
basically if you see the latest edition
of dental phillips once they are done
with every chapter
they have beautifully given one or two
pages of synopsis or summary of that
okay that area is more important because
I have seen questions from that area in
specific in meat and PGA okay rather
than going very deep into the textbook
which is impossible you can you can do
that summary part of discussions on the
group where you will have some extra
reading some I am secure some rapid-fire
some concepts okay then you need to
check any videos that are being uploaded
on the site or on the YouTube for that
particular topic in MDS concur point of
view because I'm going to post the links
if any video is getting uploaded so once
you're done with this the last but not
the least is you can give your daily
exam okay even the daily exam links will
be posted on the group okay so this is
how you need to plan this particular
subject that is both dental materials
and prosthetics along with the implants
for the month of December okay so
December 30th is going to be your exam
and 31st you can take break and we can
treat other things on Jan second okay I
hope this is clear and it is in firm a -
thank you all
