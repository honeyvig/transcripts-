hello everyone and welcome to the part
two video of creating a task manager
application using HTML CSS and
JavaScript guys if you haven't watched
the part one video click on the IE
button to navigate to the part one video
where we are creating the front end in
this video we'll be creating the backend
Logic for our Task Manager application
watch this video till the end if you
want to learn more about it now before
we move on I request you guys that do
not forget to hit the Subscribe button
and click the Bell icon for the future
updates
just a quick info guys simply learn has
got a postgraduate program in full stack
web development in collaboration with
the Caltech University in this course
you're going to learn the modern coding
techniques with the boot cam level
intensity and gain all you need to be a
full stack Technologies so guys you can
check out the link in the description
box now guys let us add the backend part
we'll be using JavaScript to add the
logic so that our front-end application
could interact with the back end
so let us create a function first okay
and I will name this function
as add
task okay now what I have to do guys now
let us declare a variable called input
okay and in this
input I will say let us get the element
by ID okay so document
do get element by ID and in this I want
to say I need a task
input
okay now similarly I will create another
variable for uh okay let's rename it as
task
input okay now we will create another
variable with the name as task list okay
so all over here
and in this I will add the task
list very good now let us add some
Logics so if I say if the input value is
an empty string then I would say please
add a task okay so let's write that
logic so it will be under if and else
condition so if task input okay now I'm
going to use this variable and I will
use
value when this is equals to empty
string okay now for the same purpose
purposes I would
say okay now if the input value is an
empty string then I would say
alert
okay please enter a
task and with that said guys I will
return okay now similarly let us create
some list okay now so that our certain
elements would be created and it would
be added in the Dom so let us create
another variable called Li okay
and in this I would say
document do create
element
Ali
okay now similarly I would create a text
node
so
where text
node same equals to document. create
element okay I'll copy
this and in this I would say document.
create text node okay so it will be
creating a text node
and in this I would say task
input dot
value now similarly I would append this
child okay so for appending it into our
Dom I would say lii do append
child okay
and I would add this element called text
node that sounds pretty cool now let's
move on and let us add our delete button
to the Dom so for creating the delete
button guys what we can do all over here
okay we write the same principles like
where delete
button and this will be equals to
document dot create element
okay and in this will be the
button now I would change the inner HTML
of the same so by typing the delete
button delete
dot delete button do inner
HTML okay and this will be changed to
delete
then the
same on
click and I would say task list okay
same list which we have created and I
would say remove the
child and the element which I have
created Li I would add it all over here
sounds pretty cool now let's move on to
the next part okay now delete button is
a function okay just remember this okay
now we have completed this part now let
us create a complete button for the same
so we'll create
where
complete button which is equals to
document dot create
element in this I will create the
complete button so document. create
element and I'll just add the name as
button pretty
good now now what I will do next I will
change the inner HTML so the same name
I'm going to copy it and I would say
complete button dot inner
HTML which is equals to say
complete so you would be seeing this in
the Dom as when you are changing the uh
the status by clicking on the complete
button so we'll be changing or
manipulating a Dom by this now it will
show completed and let us create a
function okay to implement that logic
so let us copy
this
and complete button do
onclick okay and this will be a
function
Alli
do class
list do
toggle and I would say it as
completed okay now let us append all
these things so Ali
do append child okay we can see this
method all over here and let us add the
delete
button similarly I'm going to add the
complete
button pretty good guys now let us
append the LI okay so after this I would
say as the state has been updated all
over here so I would say task
list dot
appen
Li and the task input value would
be say it's equals to the empty
string
now let us break down this code and
understand this one by one okay there's
some error showing all over here let us
figure it out so it is function
okay okay as you can see it should be
small okay now our backend Logic for
this UI has been
done and we could see some minute errors
also all over here
so just remove this one more equal to
sign so now let us break down this code
one by one so we can see there's a
variable I have created where task input
okay so what this does basically this is
going to retrieve the input element with
the ID called task input from the HTML
document and it is going to assign the
variable as task input then similarly I
have done for the task list what is
going to do guys this also line we're
going to retrieve the element with the
ID name as task list from the HTML
document and it has been assigned to the
this variable now here the logic has
been written that if the value written
all over here okay so this condition is
going to check if the task input is an
empty string so it displays an alert
that please enter a task now where Ally
equals to document. create element Ali
if we look up to this line it means that
it is going to create a new list item
okay Ali and it is going to assign a
variable Alli to it then similarly I
have created a text node okay so
document. create text node what is going
to do it is going to create a new text
node containing the input value of the
task input and it is going to assign to
this variable called text node now if
you move on a little bit more you can
see Alli do upend child is there okay
now if we go on to this line this line
means that it is going to append the new
text node containing the value of the
task input okay with the newly created
Li item similarly I have created the
delete button all over here so delete
button is being created in the HTML
document okay this uh element is going
to get added now delete button do inner
HTML equals to delete what this line is
going to do guys this line is going to
set the inner HTML content of the delete
button to delete now when we are on
clicking this button what is going to
happen this is basically removing the
task list okay from the given list now
similarly the complete button is there
we are creating the complete button okay
and it is going to set the inner HTML to
complete all over here and on clicking
this button is going to toggle that it
has been completed now we have appended
delete button and complete button to our
Dom as far as the manipulation we are
doing on the UI the back end is going to
take care of it now let us see the UI
and again try to understand this code
now let us see on the browser and see
how we have implemented our backend
logic and how it is manipulating the
front end part of it now let us go back
to our browser and check the application
so guys as you can see this is our Task
Manager application now let us try to
add a task
say
jym at
9 p.m.
okay then we can add a task like
studying
Jim
at 7
p.m.
cooking at 10
p.m. now let us see that I have
completed my this task that studying
German at 9 so I can just click on
complete and you can see after toggling
this button there's a line which Cuts
this off and shows that this task is
completed now if I want to remove this
task guys I can click on the delete
button and see from our Dom it gets
deleted similarly if I could mark this
as completed this as has completed it
would be completed but if I want to
delete all this still you could delete
it so guys I hope you enjoyed our
