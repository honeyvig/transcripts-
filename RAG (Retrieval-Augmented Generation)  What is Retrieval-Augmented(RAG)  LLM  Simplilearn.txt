have you ever wondered guys that how AI
models like chat GPT or Google bars
generate answers well they are
impressive tools but they have just one
big limitation they are only as good as
the data they have been trained on that
means they don't always have the most
upto-date information or access to
specific knowledge beyond their training
period but what if there's a way for
these models to go beyond their training
and pull in realtime external data to
improve their answers that that's right
guys and the answer is with the help of
RG so guys in today's video we are going
to learn about retrieval augmented
generation craving a career upgrade
subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back now before you move on just a quick
info guys simply learn has got a
postgraduate program in AI machine
learning you can boost your career with
this AIML course delivered in
collaboration with P University and IBM
you will learn in demand skills such as
machine learning deep learning NLP
computer vision reinforcement learning
and many more so guys hurry up now and
join the course the course link is
mentioned in the description box so
let's get started so guys imagine a
scenario where a child asks their mother
which planet has the most moons based on
what she learned in her school the
mother confidently responds that Jupiter
has the most moons her answer is correct
according to the knowledge she has
gained sometimes ago but what she
doesn't know is that more recent
discoveries have changed this fact this
is where two main issues come with
traditional large language models the
first one is no external data source so
with respect to this case the mother is
solely relying on the information stored
in her memory without consulting any
external sources like a book or the
internet this exactly what happens with
llm like chat GPD they can generate
answers based on the data they were
trained on and they don't have access to
real-time updates unless specifically
program to do so next one is outdated
information since the mother hasn't kept
up with the latest astronomical
discoveries a knowledge is outdated this
is another common problem with llms they
are trained on a fixed data set up to a
certain point which means they don't
have access to new information after all
now imagine if the mother had access to
the real-time databases like
encyclopedia or an Internet connected
device she could quickly look up at the
latest data and the number of moons each
planet has so guys that's where
retrieval augment generation comes into
the play if mother had access to search
engine or a database RSG can retrieve
information from external sources
whether its databases websites or other
documents allowing them to answer
queries based on both internal knowledge
and external data so instead of Simply
relying on what it knows the AI
retrieves new information when ask
something that falls outside its
knowledge base when it involves recent
events of facts this ensures that the
model can stay relevant and accurate if
you talk about what exactly is R so guys
R is a framework that enhances the
capabilities of a large language model
by incorporating external knowledge
through retrieval mechanism so guys this
basically system is designed to improve
accuracy relevance especially when
you're dealing with the complex
questions now let us try to understand
the components of RG so guys the first
one is retrieval second one is
Generation third one is augmentation so
guys our first step is retrieval the
retrieval process in the mother case
would be that she has to access a search
engine or a database so that she could
retrieve the most upto-date information
on the number of moons this is what RG
models do they can retrieve information
from external sources whether it's
databases websites or other documents
allowing them to answer queries based on
both internal knowledge and external
data so instead of Simply relying on
what it knows the AI retrieves the new
information when ask something that
falls outside the knowledge base or when
it involves recent event of Acts this
ensures that the model can stay relevant
and accurate next one we have
augmentation once the mother retrieves
this data in this case she augments her
knowledge with the new information she
combines what she just learned with her
previous understanding of the solar
system this augmentation process happens
in RG where the model takes the retrieve
information and merges it with
pre-existing knowledge to give a more
complete and accurate response this is
critical because it ensures that the
answer is just not direct quote from the
retriev data but an enhanced and
well-rounded response that incorporates
both past knowledge and newly retrieved
facts now let us talk about generation
guys now the mother is ready to provide
the final answer to her child she
generates a response actually like
Saturn now has the most moons so say the
number is 83 so here the final step is a
generation phase where the AI produces
an answer that is both upto-date and
comprehensive so by combining retrieval
and augmentation AI can generate a
response that is far more accurate and
simply relying on Based training this is
why RG is so powerful guys because it
actually Bridges a gap between outdated
knowledge and the real-time data making
llms more reliable and relevant now let
us move ahead and let us discuss about
the components of RG in a diagram so as
you can see suppose a user asks a
question so here is a smart retriever
then it looks for a specific knowledge
so there is a knowledge base and it
gives the relevant documents so guys let
us take an example so suppose you type a
question so there will be a smart
receiver so smart receiver is going to
look for a specific knowledge base and
it is going to give the relevant
documents now the question plus the
relevant documents are going to be sent
to the llm as a generator and then it's
going to generate an explicit Source
informed content so you can see like how
R is working in in this scenario now let
us take some key applications where R is
playing a major role the first one that
we have all over here is customer
support and chat BS so RG can Power
customer service BS that can provide
accurate up-to-date responses to
customer queries instead of being
limited to the pre-rain data the model
can retrieve the latest information from
a company's internal knowledge base or a
website making it more effective in
handling queries about new products
services or policies then next we have
is search engines RS can be integrated
into search engines to enhance the
relevance and accuracy of the results
instead of just returning a list of
documents the model can retrieve
relevant documents augment the search
results and generate more refined
answers to complex queries this improves
the search experience for users by
providing both data and explanations in
one place next we have research and
development in R&D environments R can
assist researchers in accessing the
latest scientific Publications patents
and reports it can generate summaries or
new insights based on retrieve data from
databases or academic jours helping
scientists stay updated on the new
findings without manually going through
the large volume of research next we
have is content creation so guys for
Content writers and marketers RG can
retrieve information on the latest
trends data points and research and then
help in generating high quality accurate
content it can assist in writing blog
Post article or reports by gathering
relevant data from multiple sources and
synthesizing it into a coherent
narrative next one we have ai powered
assistance personal digital assistants
like like Siri or Alexa can also use R
to improve the quality and relevance of
the responses they provide next we have
is personalized learning so R can also
play a very major role in personalized
learning suppose an adtech app is using
RG to make a more personalized
application for the learner and finally
we see e-commerce so guys in e-commerce
R can enhance product recommendation
systems by retrieving updated
information on product reviews customer
preferences or industry Trends it can
help generate descriptions or suggest
personalized products to customers based
on real-time data from the market in all
of these applications RG provides a
powerful mechanism for combining
retrieval of real- time external
information with generation of
insightful up-to-date responses making
it an essential tool for industries that
require both accuracy and current
information so guys that was all for
