belong to the top two percent of the
candidates who applied for the job as
robert meyer president of job market
experts reveals 98 of job seekers are
eliminated at initial resume screening
and only the top two person of
candidates make it to the interview
so now you have back that coated
interview how do you nail it before you
start with the preparation work you need
to understand what questions to expect
during the interview being prepared for
your interview with responses well in
advance can give you a leg up in the
process
hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting session from simply learn in
this session we will be discussing
amazon interview questions and answers
so without further ado let's get started
with the questions
firstly we are going to see the beginner
level amazon interview questions now
let's have a look at the interview
questions
first question
why do you want to join amazon the
answer for this question is
the growth of the company is increasing
rapidly every day and amazon has
disrupted every industry it has set at
foot in every sector in the world
it is really about putting yourself in
the shoes of the consumer to win their
trust and confidence towards company and
the skills and personality
it also helps to excel at immersing
myself in new industries and applying
that knowledge to deliver about average
results
now second question
what are checked exceptions the answer
for this question is a checked exception
is an exception that occurs at compile
time these are also called as compile
time exceptions
these exceptions cannot simply be
ignored at the time of compilation the
programmer should take care or handle
these exceptions for example if a file
is to be open but the file was not found
an exception occurs
these exceptions cannot simply be
ignored at the time of compilation
question number three what is hashing
the answer for this question is hashing
is a technique used to convert a range
of key values into a range of indexes of
an array by using the hash tables here
we can create an associative data
storage where the data index can be
found by providing its key values
now question number four
what is linear data structure
the answer for this question is a linear
data structure has elements arranged in
sequential manner and each member
element is connected to its previous and
next element such data structures are
easy to implement as computer memory is
also sequential the examples of linear
data structure are
lists q stack array etc
what does algorithm mean
the answer for this question is an
algorithm is a finite sequence of
well-defined instructions
typically used to solve a class of
specific problems or to perform a
computation
algorithms are used as specifications
for performing calculations data
processing automated reasoning automated
decision making and other tasks in
contrast a heuristic is an approach to
problem solving that may not be fully
specified or may not guarantee the
correct or optimal results especially in
problem domains where there is no
well-defined correct or optimal result
the next question is
what is a search operation the answer
for this question is search operation
means whenever an element is to be
searched start searching from the root
node then if the data is less than the k
value search the element in the left
subtree or in simple terms we can say
that searching for the element in the
right subtree
the next question is what is the purpose
of ease operator in python the answer
for this question is the ease key is
used to test if two variables refer to
the same object the test returns true if
the two objects are same objects and the
test returns false if they are not same
object even if the two objects are 100
equal use the double equals to operator
to test if two variables are equal
asb here the results in one of the id a
equals to id b
now question 8
what is a data structure the answer for
this question is data structure is a
data organization management and storage
format that enables efficient access and
modification more precisely a data
structure is a collection of data values
the relationships among them and the
functions or operations that can be
applied to the data
next question
what is the difference between tuples
and lists in python the answer for this
question is the main differences between
the less and tuples are less are
enclosed with sequence brackets and
their elements and size can be changed
whereas tuples are enclosed in round or
paranthesis and cannot be updated tuples
can be off as read-only lists now the
next question what is the tower of hanoi
the answer for this question is tara of
hannah is a mathematical puzzle that
consists of three tar specs and more
than one ring all the rings are of
different sizes and stacked upon one
another where the large disc is always
below the small disc the main aim is to
move the tower of disk from one pick to
another without breaking its properties
now the next question what are
collections api the answer for this
question is collections api is a set of
classes and interfaces that support
operations on collection of objects the
primary advantages of collection
framework are it provides
interoperability between unrelated apis
now we have the 12th question
describe a time where you have failed at
something how did you recover
the answer for this question is when i
was managing a project for one of the
biggest clients in my previous company i

is so recent and not included in your
resume
talk about a volunteering experience
that you can relate to the position
stress a strength or skill that's
essential to the current position
question number 14
what is bfs the answer for this question
is bfs or breadth first search is an
algorithm for searching a tree data
structure for a node which satisfies the
given property
it starts at the tree root and explores
all nodes of the tree at the present
depth prior to moving to the nodes at
the next depth level the extra memory
usually a queue should be needed to keep
track of the child nodes that were
encountered but not explored
now the next question
why should we hire you the answer for
this question is as a fresher i'm
looking for an opportunity to prove my
ability if i will be the part of this
company i'll put my efforts and

great achievements and if you hire me i
will get an opportunity to build my
professional experience through your
company now let us understand a few
intermediate level of amazon interview
questions
question number 16 what is heap in data
structure
heap is a self-balanced binary tree data
structure where the root node key is
compared with the child and they are
arranged accordingly a minimum heap is
apparent note has key value less than
its child and maxi parents has greater
value than its child's
now we have question number 17 what does
success mean to you the answer for this

where i am capable of achieving the
goals of the company and my team
and so i work towards completing my
individual duties as effectively as
possible
next we have question number 18
what does prim's algorithm find spanning
trees the answer for this question is
the prim's algorithm treats the nodes as
a single tree and keeps on adding new
nodes to the spanning tree from the
given graph
we have question number 19 what is
synchronization the answer for this
question is synchronization is the
capability to control the access of
multiple threats to the shared resources
synchronized keyword in java provides
looking that ensures mutual exclusive
access of shared resources and prevents
data race
now we have question number 20
list a few advantages of packages in
java
the answer for this question is packages
in java avoid the name clashes packages
in java also provide easier access
control it is easier to locate the
related classes using packages in java
next we have what is free traversal
the traversal is a process of visiting
all the nodes of a tree
all the nodes are connected via edges we
always start from the root node there
are three ways
which we use to traverse the tree which
is inorder traversal pre-order traversal
and post-order traversal now we have
question number 22 why do you decide to
go to ide the answer for this question
is while technical skills can get you
far there's a lot in it work that can be
learned on the job because of this
employers might look for someone who has
other qualities that can be linked to
success like passion and curiosity this
question can get also better for
employers to get to know you and your
story
now we have question number 23
what are your salary expectations the
answer for this question is rather than
offering a sec number of the salary you
expect provide the employer with the
range in which you'd like your salary to
fall try to keep your range tight rather
than very wide for example if you want
to make eighty thousand dollars a year a
good range offer you would make is
seventy five thousand to ninety thousand
dollars
now we have question number 24. what
does success mean to you

yourself in five words the answer for
this question is creative diligent
honest friendly and loyal
now we have question number 27 how does
kruskal's algorithm work the answer for
this question is the working of
crystal's algorithm treats the graph as
a forest and every node has an
individual tree a tree that connects to
another only and only if it has least
cost among all available options and
does not violate mst properties
now we have question number 28 how does
depth first traversal work the answer
for this question is depth first search
algorithm traverses a graph in a depth
word motion and uses a stack to remember
to get the next vertex to start a search
when a dead end occurs in any iteration
next we have 29th question what was the
biggest mistake of your life the answer
to this question is
for these kinds of question one of the
best ways to answer this question is to
talk about specific example of a time
you made a mistake explain what the
mistake was and don't elaborate much
about it quickly switch over what you
learned or how you improved after making
that mistake
at number 30 we have what is shell sort
the answer for this question is shell
sort can be explained as a variant of
insertion sort
it divides the list into smaller sub
list based on some gap variable and then
each sub list is sorted using insertion
sort in some cases it can also perform
up to
0 n log n
now question number 31 mention some
examples of greedy algorithms the answer
for this question is
examples of greedy algorithms are
criscus minimal spanning tree algorithm
travelling salesperson
knapsack problem prim's minimal spanning
tree algorithm job scheduling problem
distrust minimal spanning tree algorithm
graph map coloring graph vertex cover
next on number 32 we have what is
recursive function
the answer for this question is a
recursive function is a function which
calls itself directly or calls a
function that in turn calls it every
recursive function follows the recursive
properties based on criteria where
function stop calling itself and
progressive approach while the functions
tries to meet the base criteria in each
iteration
now number 33
list the types of data structures the
answer for this question is data
structures can be divided into two
categories those are linear structure
and non-linear data structures
now we have question number 34 what are
your strengths
the answer for this question is given
answer like creativity discipline
patience determination dedication and
honesty
now we have question number 35
what are the situations that make you

these kind of questions briefly mention
the situation that agitated you and then
move on to the solution the problem
solving attitude or bent of mind is
appreciated by every interviewer
did not over exaggerate about you being
a calm and professional person
now we have question number 36 state the
properties of b3 the answer for this
question is the properties of b3 are
every node in a b3 contains at most m
children every node in a b tree except
the root node and the leaf node contain
at least a m by two children
the root notes in the b tree must have
at least two nodes
now we have question number 37
money or work the answer for this
question is in my point of view work is
more important to me once we achieve and
over perform the target and help to
increase the growth of the company then
definitely money will follow us
now let's understand the advanced level
of amazon interview questions
at question number 38 we have mentioned
some examples of dynamic programming
algorithms
the answer for this question is knapsack
problem shortest path by daistras tara
of hanoi
project scheduling floyd warshall
algorithm fibonacci number series etc
now we have question number 39 what is q
in a data structure
the answer for this question is q in
data structure is an abstract data
structure in contrast to stack the queue
is open at both the ends one n is always
used to insert data it is called as n
cube and the other is used to remove
data which is called dq q follows fifo
methodology and the data item stored
first will be accessed
first next we have question number 14.
mention the use of default constructor
in java the answer for this question is
the purpose of default constructor in
java is to assign the default value to
the objects java compiler creates a
default constructor implicitly if there
is no constructor present in the class
now at question number 41 we have what
is a postfix expression
the answer for this question is an
expression in which the operators follow
the operands is known as postfix
expression
the benefit of this form is that there
is no need to group sub expressions in
parenthesis or to consider operator
precedence the expression a plus b will
be represented as a b plus in postfix
notation
now we have question number 42
what is selection sort
the answer for this question is
selection sort is in place sorting
technique
it divides the data set into two subsets
known as sorted and unsorted then it
selects the minimum element from the
unsorted sub list and places it into the
sorted list this iterates unless all the
elements from the unsorted sub-list are
consumed into the sorted sub-list
now at question number 43 we have write
a code of inserting a node
the answer for this question is
available on my screen please feel free
to take a screenshot for future
reference
now let's move ahead into question
number 44.
what is merge sort and how does it work
the answer for this question is merge
sort is a sorting algorithm based on
divide and conquer programming approach
merge sort keeps on dividing the list
into smaller sub list until all sub
lists have one element
and then it merges them in a sorted way
until all sub lists are consumed
it has run time complexity of 0 and log
n and it needs
0 of n auxiliary space
now we have question number 45 tell me
about a time you were unable to finish a
project and had to pivot quickly how did
you handle it
the answer for this question is at my
last job i was leading a project that
was near completion
everything was moving smoothly and on
target for timely completion then one of
our partners providing one of the
software upgrades that were to occur at
the 90
mark encountered a breach of their
systems and was estimated to delay the
project by two or four weeks instead we
were able to allocate two resources to
support the provider in recovering from
the breach in less than half of the time
that was projected
now we have question number 46
why did you leave your last job the
answer for this question is one of the
best ways to answer these kind of
questions is to be honest don't forget
to add your learnings from the situation
and how you worked on the problem areas
take care not to speak ill of your
former employer colleagues or the job
your attempt should make the answer
positive as you can
so it will be really helpful to make a
good impression on you
next we have question number 47
count possible paths in a m cross n
matrix from top left bottom to right
the code is really simple for this
question
it will be displayed on my screen
you can feel free to take a screenshot
for a future reference
now we have question number 48
write a function to give the sum of all
the numbers in the list the answer for
this question is available on my screen
the simple program segment which is a
solution of this problem is available on
my screen
now let's move ahead to the question
number 49 how to split string in java to
split a string in java the code is
really simple all you have to do is use
the function string split which is
available on my screen please take a
screenshot
now finally we have another last
question based on coding which is write
a code to find the factorial
the answer for this question is
available on my screen
you have to use a simple for loop and
the logic for calculating the factorial
numbers
you can feel free to take a screenshot
for future reference and with that we
have come to an end of this session i
hope now you guys have an idea of how
the questions are asked in amazon
interview if you have any questions
