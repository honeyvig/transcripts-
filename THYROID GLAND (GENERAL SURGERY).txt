hi this is dr. Srikant from team MDS
conquer now I'll be explaining different
types of models that are seen in the
tire plan as we know the scintigraphy is
one of the modality and identifying the
abnormality in the thyroid lands on
which isotope is given and multiple
radiographs are taken basing upon which
the nodule can be divided into hot warm
and cold guys please make a note of this
order hot followed by warm
followed by cold hot noodle is the one
in which the abnormal tissue is going to
take the isotope whereas the surrounding
normal tissue is not going to take any
sort of isotope we can clearly after
shirt in this diagram that that normal
tissue is going to take the isotope
whereas a surrounding normal tissue is
not going to take any sort of isotope
the second one is a warm nodule in which
the abnormal tissue as well as the
surrounding tissue take the isotopes you
can clearly see where the abnormal
tissue as well as the surrounding normal
tissue are going to take the isotope and
in this radiograph we can clearly
differentiate the anatomy of the thyroid
gland where the abnormal as well as the
normal surrounding thyroid gland
they observes the isotope moving to the
third category that is a cold ordeal is
a one in which the normal tissue is not
going to take the I sort of you can
clearly appreciate here the abnormal
tissues it's not going to take any sort
of isotopes this is a slight difference
between a cold warm and hot okay
they may ask a diagram this question or
they can ask a theoretical based
question I hope now you are a clarity
basing upon the difference between hot
warm and cold
hope you like this video will be coming
with one more video in a very shorter
time
