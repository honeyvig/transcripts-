hey everyone i'm vero khandewal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel
in this session we will talk about
single linked list
we shall begin a session by introducing
a single linked list
then we will try to implement it in the
code editor
after that we will try
various operations on them like
insertion and deletion
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn
so without any further ado let's get
started with introduction to single link
list
a single linked list is the linear data
structure made up of nodes
these nodes consist of two parts
data
and reference to the another pointer
these nodes can be traversed using
pointers
it starts from the head node all the way
up to
tail node
now let's try to implement the singly
linked list in the code editor start by
creating a node
to create a node we need a class
let's declare a class node
we will declare its member as public
the first member is end data
and the second member is node
pointer
next
now we will go into the main block and
initialize our first node
to initialize a node we need to use node
star
the node name had
equals to
similarly we will create more nodes
and at last repeat and our last node
tail
now we will allocate these four nodes in
the heap
to do that we will use
a node name equals to
new node
star
new node
braces
now we will allocate all the nodes in
the same manner
now we will assign data to our first
node
to access the member of the node class
we will use arrow formation
then we will use data
equals to
let's give it a value as 2.
now we will link this first node with
our second node
to do that we will use head
same error formation
and next
which will be equals to
our
n1 node
and now we have
created our first complete node
now let's create other nodes as well
n1 arrow
data
is equals to
let's give it three
and one arrow next
is equals to
n2
and two arrow
data
is equals to
5
and to arrow
next
to arrow
next
is equals to
tail
now
tail is equal still arrow data
equals to 7
and
tail
arrow
next
is given
null
now let's call up function to print this
list
we will give head as the argument
as
we can only traverse a linked list from
its head
let's write a definition for this print
list function
this function will be a void function
argument is
note star
a
we will use while loop to traverse this
linked list
we will give it
it condition
if a is not equals to
null
then
c out
is
a data
and l
now
we will change
now we will change
our cursor
from the current node to the next node
to do that we will use a is equals to a
arrow next
now let's try to execute this code
as you can see we have traversed our
complete linked list
now let's get back to our slides
we have now introduced the singly linked
list
now let's discuss some of the operations
we can apply on a linked list
first up insertion
we can perform insertion at three
different situations
like at the beginning at the last or at
a specific position after a node
next up deletion
similar to the insertion we can perform
it in three different situation as well
at the beginning at the last or at a
specific position after a node
let's talk about them in detail first up
insertion at the beginning
to execute this we have to give first
node's address to the new node's next
pointer
next up insertion at the end
to execute this we have to give new
nodes address to the last node's next
address
next up insertion at a specific position
to execute this we will change the
previous node's reference address to the
new node's address and the new nodes
reference pointer to the next node
address now let's try these operations
in a code editor as you know a linked
list is made up of node so we should
start by creating a node to create a
node we need a class
node
and we will define its members as public
print
data
and
node pointer
next
now we will create a function to insert
a new node in front of the list
for this function as an argument we will
give the reference to the head of the
list
and integer dot new data
now in the definition we will allocate a
node
new node equals to
now we will put in the data in the new
node
we will use arrows to put to access the
data
equals to
new
now we will make the next of this new
node as head
now we will move the head to point to
the new node
now we will create another function to
insert a node after a specific position
as arguments we will give it
the address to the previous node
and
the integer new data
we will first check
if the given previous node is null
it is we will print
given node
and not
and then we will return the function
otherwise
otherwise we will allocate a new node
and then we will enter the new data
now we will make the next of the new
node as a next of the previous node
and then we will move the next of the
previous nodes as new node
now we will write a function to insert a
node at the end of the list
as an argument we will give it
a node pointer to pointer
and
and integer new data
we will first allocate a new node
we will also create a last node
and give it
now we will put in the data in the new
node
since this new node is going to be the
last node so we will make its next as
null
now if the linked list is empty then
we'll make the new node as head
to check that we will use
if
star head
is equals to equals to null
if it is then we will do
star head
equals to new node
else
we will traverse it to the last node
while
last
next
not null
last
is equals to
past
next
now we will change the next of the last
node as new node
now we will write a function to print
this list
while
node is not null
see out
load
arrow
data
and then
and node
equals to
node
now we will write the code for the main
block
first we will define a head node
and mark it as null
now we will start using those functions
to make a linked list
first we will use append function
to add
6 in it
next let's let's use another function
push
and add seven in it
now we will try to insert one at the
beginning
so we will use push again
comma one
now let's try to insert four at the end
so far the list looks like one seven six
four null
now let's
let's try to insert eight after seven
to do that we will use insert
as argument we will use head next as 7
is present next to the head
eight
now let's try to print this linked list
see out
created
linked
yes
list
add
return
let's execute this
as you can see we have created the
linked list in the correct order
let's get back to our slides now let's
talk about deletion first up deletion at
the beginning
to execute this we have to change first
node's next address to null
next up deletion at the end
to execute this we have to change the
second last node's address to the null
next up deletion at the specific
position
we will change the previous node's
reference address to the next node's
address
now let's try these operations in a code
editor
we will start by creating a class
in this class we will declare the
members as public
print
data
and the node pointer next
now to insert the data in the node we
will use
a function
push
as argument we will give pointer to
pointer node
header
and
integer new data
we will allocate a new node
we will give this new node the data as
new data
and
and new notes next as head
now we will write a function to delete
the node
as argument we will give a node pointer
to pointer
head
and end key
now we will store head in a temp node
and we will create a node prev
as null
if head node itself holds the key to be
deleted we will use f
amp is not equals to
null
and
temp
data
is equal to equals to key
then head
equals to
next
now we will free the old node
else we will search for the key to be
deleted
while
amp
is not equals to
and
temp data
is not key
so rev
equals to temp
and temp
will be hydrated to its next
if
the key is not present in the linked
list
then we will just return the function
else we will unlink the node from the
linked list
and delete
now we will write a print list function
to print the list
its argument will be a node pointer node
while
a node is not null
layout
less than
node
data
and we will iterate this node
using node equals to
node
next
now we will move on to the main block
we will start with the empty list
node
star
head
equals to null
now we will add the element to this list
so push
ampersand
head
comma seven
next push
next push
ampersand
comma
nine
now see out
created
test
printless
now we will use delete node function
delete
to
we will use argument as
ampersand head
comma
two
now
we will check
the linked list
of
two
print
test
let's try and execute this
as you can see we have deleted the two
from the linked list
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have learnt
in this session first up we have
recognized single linked list as dynamic
data structure
next up the single link lists offer
faster insertion and deletion operation
next
single link lists are unidirectional
linked list that is you can only
traverse it in one direction
finally a single linked list is an asset
in implementing other data structures
like stacks and queues
