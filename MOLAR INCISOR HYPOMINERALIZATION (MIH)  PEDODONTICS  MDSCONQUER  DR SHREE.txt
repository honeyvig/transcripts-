yeah hi winners uh hope you're doing
good so uh this is Dr Sant from Team MDS
conquer so now I'll be discussing one of
the most important topic of uh the pedo
in integrated with oral path and oral
medicine uh which is nowadays very
frequently Asked in the
examinations uh let it be a national
boards or Let It Be Your neat or inic or
any sort of
uh license exams uh uh this is one of
the most commonly asked clinical based
question so before jumping into the
topic uh so learning is a is a beautiful
process it is nowhere related to the age
of an individual or a position of an
individual if you have the will to learn
okay the things around you will change
okay so strongly recommend every one of
you to inculcate this particular habit
of learning from the surroundings or
learning from the people around you and
start implementing them in your
professional as well as in your personal
life so the topic of discussion for
today is
mih that is molar incisor hypom
mineralization so you have hypo
mineralization which is more of an a uh
focused on area specific that is merss
and
incisors so before going into the
content you have a case here okay a
9-year-old Brazilian
boy with a chief complaint of yellow
colored
patches on maxillary mandibular centrals
laterals and first merss as shown in the
above clinical photograph his mother
gives no complications during pregnancy
but has a flu with a high favor of 103°
fahit for more than a week during the
the first year so what is the diagnosis
and treatment plan of course the
diagnosis is very simple that is
mih the most important aspect in this
particular question
is Brazilian boy why it is being
mentioned it's very simple the
prevalency of mih is more in these
individuals one the second important
aspect is area specific okay the this
occurs area specific the hypo
mineralization is being occurring in
area specific
that is your maxillary mandibular
centrals that is incisors and your first
MERS and of course they have a
background ethiology that there is high
favor at the age of one year for more
than a week that can be the ethiology in
this particular case so this is all
about mih so we'll try to wrap up this
mih as fast as possible and we'll try to
discuss few other hypo mineralizations
within our limitations with in the
differential diagnosis is part of this
particular
disease so first and foremost thing is
about enamel because enamel is the most
commonly affected structure in this
particular mih so anamel e e
for ectoderm so anamel is ectodermal in
origin and coming to M M for
mineralization so anamel is having the
highest mineralization among the
structure you have anamel Dentin
cementum and alular Bone so if you list
out the mineral content or
mineralization aspect anamel is having
the highest mineralization okay and
second thing anamel does not have the
ability to regenerate after it is lost
okay you cannot regenerate anamel and of
course anamel is formed
from ameloblast and this ameloblast is
very
sensitive it is very sensitive to the
external environment it is very
sensitive to the infections it is is
very sensitive to every aspect and in
which stage they can ask you that is in
the formative stage so an anal has
different stages of formation which will
be discussed in your dental histology so
anamel is very sensitive in formative
stat and it shows its reactions in the
form of hyp metalization or
hypocalcification or hypoplasia all
these are the abnormalities but that we
regularly see in the
Anam so jumping into the next aspect
definition so basically the definition
of hypo mineral definition of this H is
the hyp
mineralization hypo
mineralization plus systemic
origin systemic
origin plus first permanent molars 1 to
four any of these mostly four if not at
least 1 2 or three or
four plus similar features can be seen
in the case of
your incisors
so this is basically the definition of
hyperman relation they can ask you
diagram based question race focusing
specifically on the incisors as well as
your uh molars some cases they are
chances that it can be seen in the case
of canines it can be seen in the case of
premolars tips of canines and premolars
can also be affected but most commonly
according to the definition and to to
the you to the undergraduate level okay
so the question will be system
origin plus
your uh like your first your permanent
Ms okay the first Perman molars followed
by your the similar features can be seen
in the case of your incisors also so
this is basically uh
mih so the next important aspects are
other terms related to mih which are
given by the different scientists and
which are present in the standard
textbooks the first one is of course M
incisor hypo mineralization previously
used to be termed as an abbrevation
called as
mih the next important term is about
non-endemic stained
enamel the next one is idiopathic anamel
hypo
mineralization and the next important is
demineralizing Dem mineralized first
permanent MERS because it's most
commonly affected in the four first
permanent
MERS the next important aspect is they
can give as it as cheesy MERS the merss
in the clinical photograph appears like
a cheesy they appears like cheesy so you
have other types of merss which are
again questions asked very frequently
moons MERS malberry MERS or fortuners M
are your the merss which are seen in the
case of cental cus so cental cus is
moons MERS malber merss or your
fortuners merss whereas cheese MERS are
the term that is very specifically given
to Mi and the next important terminology
is hyp mineralized first permanent merss
okay so these are the other terms and
very very frequently nowadays this
question was asked in in what is the
other term of M they are null fluoride
hyper mineralization it is non fluoride
hyper mination it's nowhere related to
the
fluide okay so these are other terms
that you have to make a note okay and
next one is coming to ethiology so
ethiology uh there are different types
of ethiology and there are studies which
are showing uh the background history
particularly the medical problems during
the pre uh or per or postnatal periods
okay so that can be an infections very
frequently uh the case- based questions
can be integrated with a respiratory
infection to the individual or a viral
infection okay they can tell you the
patient is having fever they can tell
you the patient is having a viral
infection with fever or they can tell
you the patient is having asthma or any
sort of respiratory illness okay so
these are the most commonly or
frequently Asked uh the medical issues
associated with pre Peri and postnatal
periods okay of course we'll discuss
them in detail but these are the things
that you have to focus on
uh the next important thing is uh
relation to fluoride okay so M chances
will be less in the individuals uh who
are exposed to more fluoride it's very
simple the fluoride content increases uh
during the particular uh period of
period of growth the amh chances will
decrease the next one is antibiotics
there are few antibiotics which can lead
to mih uh particularly uh the
antibiotics uh which are mentioned uh in
references are uh your penins
particularly amoxin uh and followed by
uh your aromy okay so both of these and
there are few drugs which are basically
associated with uh the hypo
mineralization can also uh lead to the
uh mih but specifically it is
antibiotics which are related to that is
amoxin and your
aryin okay so next important aspect is
breastfeeding prolonged breastfeeding
okay so if the individual is having a
prolonged breastfeeding okay so there
are higher chances of occurrence of of
Mah because uh because of the lack of
calcium okay so prolonged breastfeeding
can uh cause uh like okay so you can add
a note about long prolong uh breast
feding so then comes the next one is
environmental toxins there are few
environmental toxins uh which can also
cause this okay so environmental toxins
particularly uh they were named
as
poly chlorinated
bols
or or
your dioxins okay so both of these are
responsible for occurrence of uh
mih so then comes the socio economic
background okay the economical
background of the individual the
economical background of the individual
uh can be like if they're originated
from low social economic status uh
because of lack of nutrition proper
nutrition during the growth period there
are high chances of occurrence of MH so
here you have to focus mainly on the
aspects related to respiratory illness
or the favor or viral infections as
prenatal as fluoride content increases
the chances of MH decreases you have two
antibiotics and you have two
environmental toxins and of course
prolonged breastfeeding are the uh
primary ethologist for occurrence of
this particular
abnormality then comes as I said like uh
it can be due to uh the poor health or
any systemic medications or the mother
is having nitrous oxide during the uh
pregnancy uh I mean during the uh during
the delivery and the birth complications
okay so the birth complications can lead
to mih that can be your hypocalcemia or
asfixia related to the respiratory
system or uh the period of Labor
prolonged period of Labor uh the patient
is having high favor respiratory illness
uh that can be uh related to asthma or
ear infection that is aitis Media or
systemic fibrosis Ral diseases or viral
diseases like chicken poox misil all
these can be the background history they
can give in the uh they can give in the
case based description I'm primarily
focusing the list of these things uh as
a case based aspect okay no need to mug
all these things it is more logical they
can ask you mostly a case based or a or
a treatment based question on this uh
they can be like pre-term baby okay
pre-term baby is nothing but uh less
than 37 weeks very frequently asked what
is pre-term baby pre-term baby means
less than 37 weeks or low birth weight
lowth weight is nothing
but less than 2.5 kgs or
2,500 G okay so these are the main uh
medical related pre Peri and postnatal
uh disorders which can lead to mih they
can be considered as an ethiology the
most important aspect is respiratory
origin diseases like asthma and cystic
fibrosis or viral diseases okay or favor
prolong favor can be an ethiology for
occurrence of
Mi so next one is coming to jumping into
the clinical presentation anamal
hypoplasia are familiar so diagram based
very specific to incisors and Ms that
can be easily handled and now uh these
These are the criterias that are given
by the European Association okay so the
criteria includes these things okay I
I'll be discussing these things in a
descriptive part because your questions
will move around these areas okay so
you'll have opacities clinically visible
you have post eruptive anamel breakdown
that is very very important so in most
of your hypo mineralizations whatever
discussed in your oral path and oral
medicine uh the anamal breakdown occurs
before the eruption or during the
process of eruption but here the anamal
breakdown will occur post eruptive means
after the eruption the anamal breakdown
is going to occur and you will have
atypical uh Restorations you'll have
Restorations which are not normal which
are quely abnormal you see the abnormal
registrations uh the margins are being
extended you'll have patches of
registrations here and there so that is
very specifically called as atypical
Restorations uh and of course the
patient may complaint of extractions of
merss that can be due to mih again or
sometimes there will be eruption failure
of molars or incisors so these are the
main clinical uh presentations of mih
okay or the clinical criteria the
presentation of Mi as anamal is lost the
patient most commonly complaints
complaint of pain or hyper sensitivity
dentinal hypers sensitivity is the most
common complaint because anamal is lost
and Dentin is being exposed so whenever
the Dentin is being exposed the patient
will have pain and hypers sensitivity so
these are the main important aspects in
the clinical presentation okay so
luckily in the in the in the in the
clinical uh case is what we have
discussed the patient doesn't have any
symptoms the symptoms were not mentioned
the patient concent is Aesthetics that
is your first point obasi yellow color
patches are
same so then jumping into this uh this
is given by uh European Association of
Pediatrics pedod Pediatrics okay so
already discussed that is your
discriminate obesities okay post erupto
anamal breakdown atypical registrations
and extractions extracted molars because
of this particular leion okay so these
areas are very very important I want you
to focus on everything is
self-explanatory and abnormality in the
transiency of anamel identified as
creamy white or yellow to brown color
opties this these are the particular
terms creamy white creamy white or
cheesy white that is the reason why
these are called as cheesy Ms which with
clear and distant borders uh adjacent to
the unaffected anamel okay the second
one is I told you there will be anamel
breakdown that is uh disintegration of
anamel followed following the tooth
eruption potentially resulting from the
masticatory forces because the anamel
here it is very thin or very weak that
is fral anamel will be there it will be
easily break down and coming to the
atypical restrictions which I have
already explained that is basically the
size and shape of the uh restoration is
not confined normally if you prepare
cavities or if you dig out the enamel
and if you start giving the restoration
the margins are very distant okay you
can clearly tell this is the boundary of
this particular restoration but when
you're talking about a typical
Restorations which are seen in the case
of mih you don't have proper boundaries
you don't have proper uh I mean the
borders the refinement will not be there
okay in most of the cases the extensions
can be on the Buckle and the palatal
smooth surfaces also right normally we
don't have the cares lesions or cavities
which are extending mostly on the Buckle
and palad very rarely we see this Buckle
Extinction pallet Extinction cases uh in
your clinical scenario in the
Departments also okay so that is very
important when talking about extractions
basically due to to uh extraction of
merss or extractions of incisors
basically due to this breakdown uh the
patient is going to give in the form of
a history so these are the very
important criterias of mih that you have
to make a note because questions were
asked on this particular table in in
recently so then uh apart from this uh
there are few other things which we have
to discuss particularly about the
thickness uh and other aspects so as
already discussed uh most of these are
as the areas affected are
oclusion surface of
molars and can be seen on the Buckle or
labial surface of incisors which we can
clearly appreciate in the diagram cheesy
molars cheesy is mostly on the ocal
surface okay so next one the extent of
involvement the extent of involvement
they can ask you the extent of
involvement uh in the enamel can be in
the range of uh can be in the range of
thickness of 1/3 to 2/3 thickness 1/3 to
2/3 thickness and there are few
important the defs less than 2 mm if you
see anamel defects less than 2 mm they
are not considered as MH uh
defects less than 2
mm are
not considered as a m i h okay so the
next important point that you have to
make a note because the questions can be
asked because the questions were already
repeated in uh in few examinations on
this particular area so I want you to
make a note about these aspects that is
the cpel inclinations you see this is
the cusp the cusp this is a cusp
tip and these are inclinations okay the
the inclinations are
affected but not the cpel tips the cpel
tips are not affected okay in this
particular individuals and of course you
know it is more commonly seen in the
case of molars compared to incisors that
is your first permanent Ms and uh
sometimes you can see these extensions
on the tips of uh the canines as well as
the prolar but it is very very rarely
but this type of presentation can be
seen in the primary dentation also okay
it can be seen in the primary it can be
seen in the permanent also more commonly
seen in the case of molars compared to
the incisors cpel tips are not affected
inclinations are affected less than 2 mm
are not considered as MH extended
defects can be from 1/3 to 2/3 thickness
of the enamel most commonly seen on the
ocal surface of molars and buckle and
labal surfaces of incisors so these are
the important things that you have to
make a note clinically okay they can to
ask you questions on these
areas next one there is something called
as sority grading of Mah Mah has been
divided into two severities that is mild
and severe okay mild is discriminate
anamal opacity it is without anamel
breakdown there's no breakdown of the
anamel okay the patient may have uh
occasionally sensitivity will be there
next one is second category discriminate
anamal opacities with the breakdown the
patient will have spontaneous hypers
sensitivity affecting the function
aesthetic problems and everything two
categories mild and severe there are
different types of index scales uh that
are helps in distinguishing this mih but
they are not much important from the
examination point of view so we can
stick onto these areas particularly your
clinical criteria what I have discussed
according to European Association of uh
Pediatrics is very very important from
examination point of
view so as already said it is more
inclined to the permanent dention but
can be seen in the case of deciduous
teeth also that is your decious molar
hyp mineralization that is anamal hyp
mineralization is also reported in the
primary teeth okay and you can see the
clinical photograph where both primary
as well as permanent teeth are being
affected by hyper mineralization okay in
primary in permanent dentation it is the
first molars which are most commonly
affected whereas in the case of your
primary dentation it is the second merss
which are most commonly affected your
second merss and in second merss are
most commonly affected very rarely inors
are going to get affected sometimes the
primary canines as well as first M the
most important area is the teeth MO is
most commonly affected by MH is your
permanent merss the teeth which is most
commonly affected in your primary
dentation is your second primary
model coming to differential diagnosis
this is utmost important aspect
according to me because uh questions on
MH yes chances are there but questions
on other hyp mineralization or other
effects of anamel are very very
frequently Asked in the examination okay
so coming to differential diagnosis
apart from mih what are the other areas
uh where your anamal is being affected
the first and foremost thing is amalen
is imperfect okay you can see amalen
imperfect the unique property of amalen
imperfect is all the teeth are affected
you see all the teeth anamal part is
being affected you can see in the
clinical photograph you can see in the
clinical photograph that all the teeth
okay you can see all the teeth are being
affected okay the first the second thing
is the family history will be there
because animal imperfecta is basically
origin defect from the genes okay so it
is carried from Generations so you can
ask you whether uh the parent so in this
in this question again they're going to
give you the mother is having the same
uh clinical future or the mother is
having the same complaint or they can
tell you the siblings are having the
same complain so family history will be
present and the utmost important thing
again you can see the radiographic
appearance of amens is imperfecta when
compared to MH MH does not have a
drastic changes in the radiographic
picture except the defects in the anal
whereas you see Amen in perfector you
will have a tood DA appearance on a
radiograph which help helps in
differentiating uh the mih from amalen
perect important points all teeth
affected mih only incisors and MERS are
affected next one family history will be
there here no family history will be
there okay next one is fluorosis okay so
fluorosis are basically uh uh is
origined from a background or a region
where there is high fluoride exposure to
the individual so they can give that as
a background information okay and the
number of teeth affected during the
fluorosis in the Flor case depends upon
the time of exposure so this we'll be
discussing in the pedo uh and integrated
with your fuis and all these things the
pedo integrated with Community part we
can discuss which area which duration if
an individual is being exposed to
fluorides or individual is exposed to
tetracyclin so there will be stains
which teeth are affected so this is
again a table this table is there very
important from examination point of view
okay the table is there very important
particularly if you're preparing for
national boards so this correlationship
table is very frequ frequently Asked
okay so the number of teeth affected
depends upon the time of exposure and
the amount of fluoride that is being
exposed in these individuals okay that
is how you can differentiate fluorosis
case and followed by there is something
called as anamal hypoplasia so anamal
hypoplasia can be partial affecting only
few teeth or can be complete complete
affecting all teeth or affecting the
entire part of anamel so how can you
differentiate this uh so this this
anamal hyperopia is basically occurred
at the time of eruption and what we have
discussed about mih mih is post
eruption means the individual will have
a normal anamel and over a period of
time during the mitigation process MH
will be detected whereas anamel
hypoplasia will be seen at the time of
birth time of eruption during the time
of eruption at the birth or during the
time of eruption you can diagnosis this
anamal
hypa
so the next important aspect uh after
anamal
hypoplasia is of course your M MH we
have discussed a lot about MH MH is
basically seen in the case of molars
compared to incisors and how you can
like a severe form of MH which is
affecting all the teeth you may get
confused with amalen is imperfecta so
Amal imperfecta and a Severe form of mih
looks same because I have discussed the
sever form of MH can affect all the
teeth including the canines as well as
the premolars okay so now you can
differentiate only with the help of
radiograph because radiographic presence
are there in the case of your amalen imp
perfector and these radiographic
appearances will be absent in the case
of your tontis sorry absent in the case
of your uh mih okay so that is how you
can differentiate uh a severe form of
mih to that of amens is
imperfect so next one more important
most frequently seen is white spotle
what is White Spot letion White Spot
letion is called as insufficient car
letion or in initial car letion that is
basically occurring due to the drift or
change in the rization demalation cycle
you have something called as rization
demalation cycle so whenever your
reation demalation cycle is most
commonly shift to demalation side okay
then there is high chance of occurrence
of white spot leion and White Spot leion
can occur anywhere on the lavial surface
or anywhere on the teeth but most occurs
on the cervical areas why because plaque
accumulation and chances of changing
this rization demalation cycle will
Morely seen in the cervical one okay so
white spot lesions can be seen in those
areas where the plaque is being
accumulated and there will be intact
anamal but there will be subsurface
demonization so white spot leion is also
called as
subsurface demineralization it is more
often related to the initial steps of
the carries but most of the things
whatever we are discussed are not
related to the Caris they have high
chances of Caris occurrence by presence
of MH High chance of Caris occurrence
will be there okay but this is process
of Caris okay so that's about White Spot
leion the next comes is turnus
hypoplasia or turnus teeth don't get
confused with turnus syndrome turnus
syndrome I hope like uh you you know the
turnus syndrome that is 45 XO okay right
45x is a turnus syndrome this is turnus
hypoplasia or turnus teeth okay here you
can see a particular teeth is being
affected from its shape shape and form
basically it is due to the trauma there
are few textbooks telling it as
traumatic hypomineralization also or
traumatic hypoplasia one of the reason
is trauma okay and other reasons can be
many other things the changes during the
primary dentation so this is most
commonly seen in the case of permanent
premolars uh because primary molars are
most commonly affected by Dental cares
and the infection from primary merss
will reach
the per epical
area and which is going to affect the
fellow we have discussed the fellow that
is M blast fellow will get affected and
it will lead to turnus hyperia this is
localized anamal hypop means only a
particular teeth only one teeth or two
teeth are going to get affected and
preferably most commonly seen in the
case of mandibular
premolars area specific it is Mand PR M
merss permanent merss okay so this is
how you can differentiate Turners
hyperplasia from uh
mih next comes of course questions very
frequently as recent neat examination
there is a question on this right coming
to the syphilis okay so these are the
Futures which are seen in the case of
cental syphilis and of course you are
very familiar with the Triad of cental
syphilis so you have incisors as well as
MERS are affected similarly coming to
area specific syphilis area specific
they can ask you uh the combination I
mean the common thing that you see in
the case of cental cus and mih is area
of occurrence so it can be occurred your
abnormality of teeth can occur in
incisors as well as in the case of your
merss in the syphilis also so incisors
are called as hutchingson incisors okay
so you'll have a notch like this uh and
Ms Ms are called as malberry Ms or they
can be called as Moon
merss Moon MERS or fortuners MERS
okay which are seen in the case of your
cental syphus okay that diagram based
question or they can give you the
background history of syphilis to the
mother or they can tell you that the
mother is regularly having in a uh
unprotected sexual contact they can give
some futures of syphilis okay you have
lots lots of things about syphilis which
are discussed in oral pathon oral
medicine part you can do that right so
these are the important differential
diagnosis part uh coming to the clinical
problems until now we have discussed the
clinical uh uh clinical criteria and
everything clinical problems I said like
anamel lost what is the problem if
anamel is not there anyone like you and
me your parents will have a loss of
anamel okay what is going to happen the
patient is having dentinal hypers
sensitivity and of course if severe loss
the patient is going to have break
breakdown pain will be the pain and uh
sensitivity are most common complaints
and of course uh these are seen as a
post-operative breakdown okay so the
patient have difficulty in mastication
so there's are some clinical
consideration are more prone to cares
anamal is weak more prone to cares
anamel is weak discolorations more prone
to poor
Aesthetics and need recurrent uh
treatments because all all the teeth
will not get affected by the same time
okay so destrction will be at different
phases so recurrent treatments are
required so these are the clinical
problems associated with uh the
m and coming to the treatment plans okay
so treatment plan of M is very very
simple okay so don't write heavy heavy
notes okay so try to understand the
content once you understand the cont it
is very easy to answer so MH can affect
the permanent merss that is first
permanent molars fpm fpm is very
commonly used term for M that is first
permanent uh molar hypo mineralization
okay next one incisors are affected so
incisors are mostly concerned with
Aesthetics whereas merss are mostly
concerned with mitigatory procedure that
is your mastication so without uh
breakdown okay that is post Arup to
breakdown postup so anamel there's no
breakdown of the anamel so one category
there's no breakdown of the anamel
second category with the breakdown of
anamel and coming to the incisors part
we have discussed one is uh cheesy or
creamy white defects are there second
one is brown color yellow brown color
defects are there different treatment
plans uh one is prevention second one is
restoration and third one is rehab okay
so these exact terms we'll be discussing
in the uh Community handicapped rehabs
and everything we'll discuss in the
community part the first chapter of
community okay so prevention basically
uh it is preferred to advise the patient
to go for high fluoride containing
toothpaste that is around 1,00 to
1500 PPM fluoride content has to be
given to the kid okay so this is going
to help in remineralization process
because what is the problem here hyper
mination and what you have to do you
have to encourage the reation the best
source of reation for us is of course
the fluorides or you can use cpacp or
you can use the other other things which
I'll be discussing now okay so that is
that is the most important aspect and
coming to the uh um fpm that is uh first
permanent m hyp mineralization without
enamel mown what you are going to do is
fluide application you can do okay that
is tropical floride application you can
do or you can
advise pit and fissure sealants
this is a preventive aspect because
there is no anamel breakdown so don't
disturb the anamel until until it is you
try to REM mineralize the anamel because
anamel can break down because there is
lack of mineralization it so what you
have to do you have to feed the anamel
with the minerals that can be done with
tropical fluoride application or any
other things like remineralizing agents
can be used there is no need of
registration there is no need of rehab
next one first permanent molar hypo
mineralization with post eruptive
breakdown there is a break down here so
when there is a breakdown what you have
to do you have to do a restoration so
what restoration GC can be given okay so
GIC can be used as interim registration
not a permanent in mih GIC can be used
as an interim uh and further you can
replace it with a nice good adesu
composite registration so that is about
the registration or sometimes there is a
drastic loss breakdown can be minimal or
breakdown can be complete so when there
is very large breakdown then you you
have to plan for the rehab with the
porcelain fused crown or you can go for
a cast metal restoration okay or you can
go for an extraction followed by
orthodontic treatment extraction
followed by orthodontic treatment is
nothing but assuming that the patient
take a radiograph patient is having
third Ms what you try to do you try to
do a balanced extraction okay if it is
already affected then you try to drag
the second MERS to the first MERS and
third MERS to the second MERS position
with the help of Ortho treatment that is
called as extraction followed by Ortho
treatment okay the next important aspect
is uh incisors okay so when you're
talking about incisors uh incisors again
you have two important aspects one is
white creamy
defect okay so one second one is brown
yellow def okay right so we are done
with the molars uh now we are talking
about incisors so incisors the main
concent for any one of us is Aesthetics
Aesthetics and incisors so so coming to
aesthetic point of view you have two
different aspects okay one is uh you
have white creamy defects second one is
you have brown yellow color defs which
I'm going to discuss detailly because
they are mainly concerned with
Aesthetics and Aesthetics we have
different types of
treatments okay I'll be discussing in
the next few uh uh slides okay and of
course we already done with this
extraction followed by orthodontic
treatment is nothing but uh because of
gross destruction or grossly affected uh
or severe form of MH okay so you are
going to extract these molars or merss
particularly so before extraction of
merss you have to take a call whether
the third Ms are present uh present or
not a of individual and everything has
to be taken into consideration so OPG
has to be taken and third M's existence
has to be confirmed so then you extract
the first molers
uh replace the positions of the first Ms
second Ms and third Ms to the position
of first and second
molars by orthodontic treatment this is
what extraction followed by Oro and of
course I'm talking about the aesthetic
considerations for the anterior teeth
creamy white yellow brown color or
obesities okay so the the three aspects
uh which can be seen as a clinical
features in the case of your mih so
three different treatment plants the
first one is creamy white opacities uh
in a in a kid less than 15 years
you can do micro aberration micro
aberration basically you have to use
preferably this has to be used 18
percentage of HCL in very few conditions
you can use 37% of phosphoric acid but I
want you to stick on 18% HCL there is
something called as micro aberation
modified crawls technique okay which we
have already discussed so modified
crawls technique what he has used he has
used 11 percentage of HCL so the updated
answer is 11 percentage of HCL if you
don't have 11 percentage of HCL then you
have have to go for 18 percentage of HCL
as an answer which is already covered in
your operative Endo okay which is
already discussed in your operative Endo
part also okay so do make a note of it
very important question was repeated so
many times in the exam so apart from
this uh whenever you have a creamy white
opacus okay so the technique that you
can use resin infiltration okay so this
is resin infiltration very very
important okay an updated version not at
a u level at a pz level it is there so
there is resin infiltration whenever you
have a defects in anamel whenever you
have a minimal defects in the Dentin you
can infiltrate the resin into the
parasitus so that is called as resin
infiltration technique or you can try
tropical fluoride application or CPP ACP
that is your remineralizing agents okay
remen cpacp is also called as tooth
mousey as in the form of a tooth Mouse
uh in the form of an a paste or
recal recal dent in the form of a
chewing gum this is chewing
gum and tooth Mouse C is a paste that
you can use it okay so the next
important aspect is yellow brown color
opacities in less than 15 years uh since
the defects can involve full thickness
of
anamel uh micro aberation cannot be so
so so effective okay white easy outer
surface you can do it but uh uh lower
part micro abration single micro
abration may not be effective so you
have to do two to three treatments of
micro abberation then you have to go for
composite restoration or then you can
try try the vur and all these uh keeping
the Aesthetics uh into consideration the
next one opacity is more than 15 years
in these individuals you can try you can
really try
this bleaching technique that is 10 to
10 to 15% 10 to 15 percentage is the
range okay 10 percentage is the best
answer that is 10% of carbom peroxidase
can be performed as a bleaching as
before you start your composite vur or
anything okay so these are the important
aspects about the treatments okay um
right so I hope uh you're clear with
this content so uh just a brief outline
okay so mih the most important aspect it
is area specific it is most commonly
seen in the case of permanent first
molars and inors okay and mih has a
background history that is systemic
oration it is okay so you have some
ethiology factors the most important
ethiology factors that they can give is
favor or respiratory illness they can
mention it as an asthma they can mention
it as a cystic fibrosis respiratory
system related origin diseases or a
viral favor or a favor of high favor for
an individual at at a particular case
and followed by there is some criteria
for this okay so the criteria four or
five important aspects let it be
opacities let it be post eruptive anamal
brain break down or let it be a typical
registrations or let it be
extractions uh due to MH are the
important criterias that you have to
make your note so followed by the
criteria the patient have complaint of
pain and hypers sensitivity those two
lines are very very important very
frequently added to your uh questions
okay then differential diagnosis so
they're very rather important how can
you differentiate anal uh amalan is in
perfector all the teeth are affected
mother or father or siblings are going
to have a same complaint okay next
followed by the second one uh when
you're talking about uh the fluorosis
fluorosis it is a Time based means how
much amount of fluide exposed what time
it is exposed so basing upon you have
turnus hyperplasia is at a single
particular preferably mandibular prolar
okay and followed by anamel hypoplasia
you have a different thing white spotl
is related to the Caris syphilis same uh
same area specific but you have a
different origin you have a background
history you have a mother suffering from
syphilis okay uh uh other features of
syphilis can be add added in the Cil
based question coming to the treatment
uh Ms with breakdown different treatment
without breakdown different treatment
anteriors you have three different
treatment plants uh one is white cheesy
second one is brown uh Brown uh yellow
to brown color opacities and third one
is a normal opacities in an individual
more than 15 years okay so I mean like
before concluding this from examination
point of view maybe in the future uh you
may get exposed to this particular case
in your clinical uh scenario or where
you're working anything so it's always
learning is a big process it's not only
this topic is not only from entrance
point of view or a University exam point
of view uh the main consent of this
topic is to is to learn is to implement
in your clinical practice or Implement
to a particular situation in the future
okay so this is all from my side okay so
as of
now signing off Dr Shan from Team MDS
conquer Take Care by
bye
