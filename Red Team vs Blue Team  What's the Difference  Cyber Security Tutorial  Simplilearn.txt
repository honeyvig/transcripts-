and then we'll see what is blue team and
the skill set of blue team then we'll
see the cyber security showdown in which

let's find out so we'll start with the
red team the red team also known as the
offensive team it consists of season
Security Professionals who specialize in
mimicking real world attack strategies
their mission is to identify and exploit
vulnerabilities in an organization's
cyber defenses and now we'll see the
advantages of the red team the red team
approach offers several advantages first
it boosts Network safety it helps find
flows in the system encourages
competition and cooperation and
amplifies knowledge on detecting and
stopping cyber results they play a
crucial role in ensuring an
organization's Readiness for prevention
detection and Remediation red team
activities involve thinking like a
hacker to break into a company security
system with permission of course they

Communications by constantly challenging
the blue team's defenses the red team
helps improve overall security now we'll
see the skill set of their team members

offensive security and penetration
testing now we'll see what is a blue
team now we'll shift our Focus to the
blue team that is also known as the
defensive team their primary role is to
maintain an organization's internal
Network defenses against cyber attacks
the work tirelessly to protect valuable
assets detect threats and respond
swiftly to any security breaches now see
their activities so what do they do so
the blue team is responsible for
analyzing digital traces auditing the
domain name system constructing
firewalls monitoring Network traffic and
employing access controls their name is
to establish a strong security posture
and prevent unauthorized access now we
will see the skill set of blue team
member so to Be an Effective member of
the blue team one must possess skills in
risk and suspend threat intelligence and
hardening techniques they work with
intrusion prevention systems inclusion
detection system and other security
software to defend against cyber attacks
now we'll see the certifications that
will be the add-on for beauty members so
certifications like compare Security
Plus giac certified incident Handler
certified Information Systems auditor
giac Security Essential certification
system security certified practitioner
Advanced security practitioner and

this the red team launches a
sophisticated attack on the
organization's Network attempting to
breach its defenses and gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data
now the red team utilizes their Advanced
skills that is penetration testing
social engineering and exporting
vulnerabilities to carry out their
attack their goal is to infiltrate the
network and extract valuable information
without getting caught on the other side
the blue team is constantly Vigilant
monitoring Network traffic analyzing
security logs and endpoint Advanced
defensive measures their objective is to
detect and prevent any unauthorized
access and swiftly respond to any

vulnerabilities in their systems by
simulating real world attacks they
provide valuable insights that enable
The Blue Team to enhance their defensive
capabilities and the red team plays a
crucial role in cyber security strategy
their simulated attacks push blue team
to the limits and reveal weaknesses the
