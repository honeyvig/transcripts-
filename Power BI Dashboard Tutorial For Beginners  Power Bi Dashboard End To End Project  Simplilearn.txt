now without further delay let's get
started now this is the data set that we
will be using today so we have a user ID
usern name platform state region
followers views likes shares comments ID
Revenue Source Revenue date Etc so let's
imagine that you run a consultancy for
social media influencers and you have
about thousands of clients right and you
need to build out a report and tell them
what what's the performance and where
are the places that needs uh or that
needs attention for improvement Etc and
what's their annual revenue monthly
revenue or weekly Revenue right you
might want to build that dashboard right
right so U before before we proceed with
the analysis we needed this data set but
this data set is not original okay this
was a chart GPD generated dat set so
nothing in this particular dat set is
authentic right so we have created a
believable data set which has the right
values but not true so Drew Johnson's
may be existing or may not be existing
but this particular data is completely
created out of charity this is
artificially generated data set not real
no in this particular data set not real
okay so before we create this particular
data set let me walk you through the
prompt that we Ed for for this
particular data set so we're going to
drop that prompt in chat jpt so let's go
through the prompt I need your help in
creating data set for 10,000 R for
social media as stash bar I would like
to have platform columns considering
five platforms so we are considering
five platform here so mainly uh the
platforms which the social media
influencers use Twitter or x Facebook
Instagram Snapchat and YouTube so have a
column uh have a date column consider
data for 5 years so we are considering
2020
2024 and include a state column so for
all the US states that we have and
include a region column north south east
west and Central regions and include
columns like followers views likes
shares and comments so the most
important criteria which the influences
to make sure that they are getting the
good amount then we have the respective
usern name and user ID so username can
be a readable right it should be a
readable name valid readable name and uh
user ID can be alpha numeric a little
bit of alphabets and a little bit of
numbers so that should be fine so for
example we will be having the user ID
usern name and platform followers views
likees shares and comments and the user
may or may not have accounts in all
platforms right so someone might have be
active in all the five platforms or
someone might be focusing solely on one
of the platforms or someone may not like
a few of the platforms right so the user
may or may not be existing in that
particular platform and have a column
for Content ID so let's say each content
that you put on um each of these
platforms should have a unique ID right
let's say you want to find out or
extract that particular content which is
generating a lot of views that made you
viral and that's generating a lot of
Revenue right so you want to track that
down so for that you might also need the
cant ID please include Revenue sources
so the revenue sources could be
sponsorship collaboration consultancy
patreon guest appearance right so these
can also be your revenue and include a
revenue column for that and dollars and
basically I want to know the top
performer of the platform for highest
you can do that right and we can also do
this on a regional level so let's say
nor regon who is the guy or who is the
girl who has the highest number of
followers highest number of Revenue
right and help me out with downloadable
data set so you can just copy this and
paste it on the chat gbd prompt and send
it there so the prompt has been sent now
it is helping us with the
downloadability set so it's giving us a
brief us ID usern name platform date
state region followers right all the
parameters that we included or wanted to
have in our uh set right it's giving a
brief and here's your downloadable CSV
file in a moment so you'll be having a
clickable link here so there you go it
has analyzed and and if you expand that
section you can see some python codes
over here and if you scroll down you can
see the downloadability
link we've already downloaded that
particular Des set and this is what I
explained you before so user ID usern
name the platform here or she is
following state region followers views
likes shares commments content ID
Revenue Source the number for the
revenue on which date so this is what we
have and uh so the this is the prompt
that we created this the data and now we
can switch back to the P PI right before
that uh let's also quickly jump into the
PowerPoint window right here so you can
see this is the background that we want
to have for our dashboard so we will be
having a client drop down menu over here
along with the search bar so you can
search for the client and when you
select the client you will have his or
her followers views likes shares
comments and revenue and you can also
specifically give a platform if you're
exploring for Twitter or Rex if you're
exploring for Facebook or meta Instagram
you can also select that in the state in
a specific state in a specific region
and the amount of Revenue the source of
Revenue right so you have a revenue
section here the total revenue you have
generated in that area and how's the
month- on Monon views performance and
how's the month-on-month performance
right so these are the things on a
glance that every social media
influencer would like to have right so
this is how you can create so you can
just make use of some shapes and boxes
in the PowerPoint and you can create as
I've got some logos here and text boxes
have made this right so if you want to
make use of this we will drop this image
in the description box below to the
Drive Link and you can have access to it
so this is how we uh have a background
and now we can quickly jump to Microsoft
powerp so we've already tried starting I
mean already started to create so let's
not continue with this let's create a
fresh page right so in this particular
fresh page we will try to add some
backgrounds so go to
visualizations and uh go to Canvas
settings and here so canvas background
sorry not canvas settings canvas
backgrounds so we will make use of the
same image that we created so it should
be in pictures and scroll down a little
there you go socials background and uh
fit is normal so you can fit it and and
we have 100% transparency there you go
so we will make it zero and if you would
like to have it a little more maybe 5%
it's good so I'll go with 5% and we
ready for visualizations so now we're
ready to insert the visualizations onto
the dashboard now so uh let's begin with
the visualizations so open data and open
visualizations so here we will be having
the drop downs right so let's go with
the bottom so the top down approach
let's let's finish the drop downs first
so for that we might have to insert some
filters or slices so we have a slicer
over here let's move the platform to the
field have the platform now and if you
go to the format visual option here you
can go to slices settings and instead of
a vertical list go with the drop down
right and uh fine and general again so
you don't want the header icon so I
don't want the header icon and I don't
want the slicer header remove that and
that should be fine and um you can go to
General again and FX so we don't want
the background here so increase
transparency to 100% and that should be
fine and if you want to increase the
text size you can also do that right and
let's continue with what we have let me
quickly push that to the platform
section there you go we have it you can
also eliminate the Border if you want
but for now let's keep it as it is right
and here the Tre TOS option go to search
so that you have a search bar so the
thing is we have just five here and you
you'll understand that when we go to the
client drop down right so when you have
a search bar you can just search and
you'll have what you want to search for
right now you can go with maybe a copy
option but let's continue with adding
more slices copy Visual and uh paste it
so we have pasted it copy it again and
paste it there we go paste it once more
and you have it right now we will make
some modifications to this particular
field right so we' have selected this
and instead of uh platform we will have
state because this is based on state
hold and drag and drop and there you go
so we will have all the US states here
and this one will modify that one as
well inad of state or inad of anything
else select that this particular one is
selected right so select that and now
instead of platform have region drag and
drop into the fields and you have the
region and now is you're the ne the you
you're at the next stage where you will
replace the platform with the region not
Southeast West Central right that's the
one drag and drop the field and you can
also copypaste the visualization once
again and you can drop it right here
where you have the clients right expand
this particular one so that we have
bigger names right and now instead of
platforms you can directly drop the
username here right now you will
understand what's the importance of
search so you have about 10,000 rows
right and let's say you wanted to find
out Alex Davis what you can do is just
type Alex space D this and you'll find
them right so that's how you do it and
uh the first top section for slices and
dropdowns is done now we will add the
some cards right so we will add some
cards so that we have the number of
followers views like shares comments and
revenue the sum right that's that's what
we looking for so go to card insert a
new card and U we will go with followers
as the field and we want sum and you can
go to visualizations and you can remove
the category labels so that you just
have number going into General FX you
can make it 100% transparent so that you
just have the number there and if you
want the visual B boundary you can have
it if not you can remove it header icons
you can remove the header icons so that
you don't want to right now so U and the
text size you can also increase or
decrease the text size for that go to
title properties and here you have the
height you can reduce the height to
about 40 or 50 according to your request
or your decision is completely your
decision and width can be um a little
maybe around 150 or let's keep it 200 so
that it fits the section correctly and
now you can also copy this copy visual
paste it align it the way you want paste
it once again align it properly and
paste that once again make sure
everything is aligned properly and one
last paste and you're done there you go
we just left out with some minor edits
so instead of the field of some
followers we will have views so some of
views in the fields and instead of likes
we will go with instead of U follows we
will go with likes here which is
summation of likes in the field so you
have U likes so I think I drop views
again so we should be dropping likes
there you go and uh make sure it aligns
properly now shares so instead of
followers we will remove followers and
add shares from this section drop it
into the field so we have the number of
shares and commands so remove followers
here and check for the commments and add
it into the field and revenue so instead
of so instead of fields in instead of
follows in the fails so we will have a
revenue let's check for the sum of
Revenue there you go you have the
revenue now check the alignment there
you go now we have the data for
followers views like shares comments and
revenue for all the clients all the
platforms all the regions all the states
all the sources right now let's also
create a line graph for views month- on-
month views right so you can either go
with the area chart or line chart I'll
go with the line chart let's undo that
quickly uh click on the uh background
here anywhere on the background and
click the line graph once again so that
we get a new one now in the x-axis we
want months right so you can have months
in the
xaxis and uh views on the Y AIS you got
the line graph over here expand that and
you can also go into visualizations I
mean the effects of visualizations and
make some app to it go to visuals and uh
go to General and here you have the
title so I don't want to title that and
header icons I don't want the header
icons tool tips I don't want tool tips
and everything is good to go and if you
want you can add some um Shadows if you
want and go to the general
visualizations and here you can add some
markers which which will give you the
drops the points of drop or rise right
so these these are the things the are
the things how it's going on with the
views and you can again copy paste this
double click copy visualization and
paste it drag it down to Performance
Revenue performance align it and there
you go and change some of the parameters
here right so in y axis so instead of
not not not the y axis that's the xaxis
you want to change right no it's the Y
AIS sorry for confusion instead of view
you will be having Revenue in y axis
there you go so your dashboard is now
ready now let's select one of the
influencers let's go with Alex Davis
there you go and let's select the
platform Instagram and this is what he's
making and select the stage California
or you can just ignore the state or you
can just on a country level you go you
can go with North or you can go with
Central so you can see where he's
dropping where he's winning right so
he's getting high on Revenue but views
are dropping maybe uh he has that uh
revenue from sponsorship and let's see
okay I think we missed some minor edits
here let's go with the visualizations
once again so here in the uh let's open
the data again so intive region have
source of uh revenue revenue Source into
the field so that we have all the
revenue sources so we can go with the
sponsorship of collaboration one of
these is really helping Alex Davis let's
go with collaboration and there you go
so likewise you can have a completely
functional dashboard for all your
clients who are social media influencers
and check their performance in terms of
uh their uh social media in terms of
Revenue like shares comments Etc from
