yeah hi everyone welcome to MDS conquer
and I'm just going to give a brief idea
about what we are going to do and what
are the options what is the mindset
because I feel like mindset and your
psychological well-being is most
important factor that is going to make
your preparation more beautiful more
easy and more successful so you should
be psychologically fit with the option
what you have opted so this orientation
session which includes few parts so I'm
going to discuss the things what you are
going to encounter in the future in few
sessions and few parts so this is the
first session so first of all I'm going
to start with this okay I hope you have
Valluvar of these two picks this is the
recent international World Cup where
India have burn all the matches until
this match and it lost the match just by
imagine just by a notch and if you go to
the final okay that is between a New
Zealand and England
okay where the final match is a drama CH
it's a time followed by once once the
match is right they will go for a super
over match a single over match again the
super over match is a draw match and
then they have lost the match by this
match
so most of us in different stages of
life we will lose the most important
thing or most deserting by a match that
margin can be the financial situation
that margin can be a time or Marx again
and I feel like most of you are most of
us including me we lost the medical seat
the MBBS seat in the poll standard
by a margin of marks maybe five or ten
or more than time it's just a margin of
marks or maybe maybe lack of money maybe
lack of time so all these things like
most of the things like even in the
preparation phase or in the final exam
like need or in the next level of your
sr exams or next level of your life
either for a cleaning call for a
government job anything most of us fail
just by imagine so conquer is going to
help you to cross that march across that
inch of much okay so to be perfect or to
be successful in the life according to
me the most important aspect is time
okay time is most important aspect and I
feel like time is the irreversible thing
on the earth okay
now you can see even deaths like cardiac
arrest or major cardiac arrest the
people are trying to do some CPR some D
fabrication techniques and they're
trying to save the patient okay we can
see there are many cases where the
patients are being saved even after
death but once the time is lost
you cannot retrieve back so I feel like
time is the most important thing time is
the irreversible thing and if you give
importance to the time time is going to
change everything in favor to you okay
so with this word I'm going to start
this and hope we are done with the final
year the results were out we are very
very happy but once the results are out
so what goes in our mind or what goes in
the regular people's mind is to have a
good life okay you're done with
undergraduation now you're going to the
next level that is post-graduation or
any any sort of things that going to
make you more professional and and to
make you more like Fame and name in the
society money and XY chart factors so to
have a lavish life or to have a
luxurious life good life after our
graduation are after particular
situation the ideology is the
dream so probably this can be the
outcome or tonight a to dream of most of
us but the next question arises like
what should I do to get this okay so
when I have this in my mind I have two
options right now after completing my
final year and entering into the
internship one is whether to stay in
India or whether to go out of country so
whether to stay in India have few
advantages like I have my friends here
okay I have my seniors here I have my
juniors I have my teachers principals
professors I have my parents relatives
brothers sisters and everyone are there
here to protect me or to save me if
anything happens where as the second
issue is if you leave the country and if
you are planning to go to the other
aspects like other areas where at the
dentistry is good the first main
important aspect is you are going to
lose the lose the first half that is
you're going to lose all your friends
relatives and everyone who are going to
stay here they're not going to be there
okay
the first important aspect but as you go
deep into this two options the main
factors to be considered is time how
much time it's going to take okay to
complete each aspect okay - for example
if you are planning to go for Canada and
clear some exams how much time it's
going to take the second one is the
financial thing that's money how much
money you are going to spend before you
earn money and how much time you require
before you earn money are the two major
important factors to be considered this
is at factor one time which is more
important of course factor 2 money that
is more for example I can give one
simple example if you are planning to
clear a license of a particular country
for example Canada okay so Canada if you
want to clear the license of Canada you
need to clear five exams and each exam
if you clear it in the first attempt
it's going to take to end of years for
you to clear the exam and get into the
country okay so this is an important
aspect that should be taken into
consideration if you are if your time is
limited for example as we are Indians
and as we
from a culture barrier where the girl is
going to get married once they're done
with their undergraduation this is a
normal custom that we follow parents
will not allow you to take two to three
years or three to four years to get
settled in other country okay so in such
conditions the time is a barrier so you
need to decide your option basing upon
the mindset of a parent so the third
factor that should be considered is
about your parents mindset whether they
cooperate whether they're not corporate
or whether they're going to give the
time not whether they're going to spend
the money No
so the first factor is time okay the
second factor is money and third factor
is the parents so if we come to the
money I'm just going to give an example
for example if you're planning to clear
an exam called as it is you're still in
Dental Council license exam so for this
exam it is too expensive like before you
enter and clear the exam you need to
spend somewhere around 10 to 20 lakhs
which is not feasible for every
individual I feel like most of the
dentistry the people who are in the
dentistry or above or be middle class
like 80% of the candidates are just
above or below middle class they are not
upper-class to spend 20 lakhs on an exam
very we are not sure that whether you're
going to create the exam or so I can
give these two as an examples one is
time and second one is a money and third
an important factor to be considered is
your parents mindset so before starting
any option whether it's an MDS in India
or a PDS with the training in India or
working as a dentist after videos are
working as a thing just after MDS so all
these factors like you have multiple
factors like you have some I mean there
are many courses that are related to the
related to the PDS after of in the
health care management like hospital
management is their health care
management is there so many such things
forensic odontology mini supreme but all
the things should be considered first of
all you need to take the positives and
the negatives of each aspect like how
your job opportunities are there how
your pay will be there how your future
after 10 years will be there for example
I'm just going to give an example like
if you are planning to be a part of
healthcare man has
okay you will have a decent pay
initially but there will be no
increasing the pay as you progress okay
as your experience increases up to a
particular level then there will be a
drastic drop in your payment but if you
take dentistry and if you have with an
MDS tag your experience increases
reciprocating Li you're paying creases
and it goes high high as you become old
and old so few positives and negatives
aspects of related profession or a
target that is decided by you has to be
considered and similarly the second
aspect that you have to be considered is
is this is right for you or not again
you will have like the factors according
to you to be considered first is in
general the factors of positives and
negatives of a particular option should
be considered and then factors according
to you has to be considered in the
second option you means for example your
parents are not willing to spend money
on you then there is no option like ADC
or there is no option like Canada okay
the only option that is left over for
you is MDS or to crack a GD see if your
financial profile is low so then that's
going to be the disadvantage of you
according to you but in general it's an
advantage okay so basing on that you
have to decide so once you decide you
have multiple options to go so option
one two three so all but my suggestion
is stick to one option so one option is
always best and is always easy to crack
so I just want to make a statement that
your goal or your option should be
always one and should be always static
because I regularly see people who has
multiple options in their mind one day
first one they start the preparation go
through the preparation phase feel that
okay I cannot do this then they shift -
okay Sara we want to go for NVDA part 1
part 2 then they stretch the preparation
for two more months for NBD part 1 and
part 2 then that I said okay my parents
cannot effect then the shift other I
have seen such people but make sure
before you start any proceedings whether
it is NBD part 1 part 2 or Canada or
Australian general council exam
or maybe MDS or need preparation make
sure that you fix and then start don't
blindly start as your friends or your
seniors have done that my senior have
done that so I am doing this my friend
is doing this so I am doing that my
junior suggested me my senior sister to
me my hitch body don't don't don't don't
take any suggestions from anyone you
decide okay before taking a decision you
decide then according to that you plan
your preparation phase whatever may be
your option so finally finally what what
majority of them says is MDS is the only
left or option in a better words I can
convert that it MDS is the best among
the rest of the options so so before
starting in detail about the aspects or
the things the main objective of me and
my team and you is to be successful in
the life to be the best in the life okay
to use your time in the most efficient
way and to come out the best outcome in
the results okay
so that's what my main aims and
objectives and of course it is same for
every individual here then I can give
you some beautiful tips and suggestions
okay why should we need to go with MDS
what are the positive aspects I was
always telling the positives and
negatives so I'm just going to talk few
positive aspects why you have to you do
MDS so first of all so before you start
anything okay don't ever compare your ug
college life or your PJs in your you g
call is to your future life okay the
ideology the trends are being changed
year to year are being changed month to
month are being changed in all the
aspects and unfortunately are
unfortunately you may or may not do your
post graduation in the same College
where you have done in the use if you
have a bad opinion or if you have a bad
mindset because of the surroundings in
your ug colors or the pcs in your you
see colors or anything in the you can
you see that makes
you feel bad about dentistry don't don't
keep it keep it just throw it out
because the future is totally different
I can just give one example like six
years back I was an intern okay
similarly like you like finding an
options and doing all the things and
what we regularly do six years or seven
years back in my Eugenia when I was in
third year of 48 years back is is is an
amalgam registration but now if you
enter any Department in Nikolas I feel
amalgam registrations are almost there
at the end phase okay so why this is
because of trend change but when I was
entering into my various life or an
authorial finally I never see laser and
a ser book or hundred question but now
if you see any cleaning or in any
callers most of the colleges they have
their inbuilt laser system that is laser
dentists to become popularized you can
see microscopic dentistry with
microscopes that is micro dentistry so
trends you need to change according to
the trend and you call is you see
everything will change apart in the
trend and don't ever compare your you
see life 2pz life or a PG in your
callers to your future PG life your
future PZ life will be so beautiful
trust me how simple is you have to make
it more beautiful because it is your
life the first and foremost thing I'm
planning to discuss is about the
computation so the computation can be
within the need or outside the need or
any way in dentistry in India so the
best computer can be either your junior
or either your senior or either a super
senior or super SuperDuper senior okay
so as you are an intern or the few
repeaters also okay we have both interns
as well as repeaters I am just going to
list out the advantages and
disadvantages between an intern and a
repeater so that accordingly you have to
plan something and get your cycling and
make yourself psychologically more
strong so that's the main reason of
keeping this part in the orientation so
stress management okay I feel stress
management is a very big task
I feel interns have less stress because
they are being exposed to the call as
half a day
okay and in the second half they have
many friends to share their issues they
share everything okay they have some
some media to manage the stress and
parents also don't keep so much burdens
on the shoulders of interns when
compared to the repeaters when combined
to other hand of repeaters so most of
the repeaters they stay at home and
study
okay they stay at home or they study
alone or even if they study in the
offline or in the offline centers in the
study rooms or the the study places they
don't interact with the people like the
main idea is they thought of like
conserving the time they don't interact
with the people even if they're alone at
home they don't talk with their friends
until they're successful because they
feel they are inferior until they are
successful they don't talk with the
people that is going to build lots of
stress so the personal solution that I
can give for a repeater is talk let's
talk okay
so let's talk is a theme right WH for
thing so let's talk you need to talk
with the people you need to express your
feelings it's something like a pressure
cooker where you need to relieve the
pressure every day but what I see in the
repeaters is they don't allow the
pressure to go out and they feel they're
more stressful and they not up to mark
in managing the stress but it is an open
secret that indents can easily talks
expose themselves out and the stress
management is comparatively good but
there is slight try and change last
three to four months when you when you
approach towards the exam in the last
three to four most intense are feeling
more stressed
of course the repeaters are too so
stress management is an important task
that we are going to discuss in the
future because we are at the initial
phase so stress management is going to
be a big task that I'm going to help you
out in the best way to management in
managing your stress so of course
intense will have an upper hand in the
stress management and repeaters find a
solution for this okay you need to talk
you need to interact with the people if
you are an offline student studying in
the study room or at the home try to
come interact with the mentors try to
talk with the mentors try to talk with
your Co aspirants learn something have
some group discussions and all these
aspects are going to decrease your
stress
they're going to enhance your
preparation and the best so the second
important aspect is textbook reading
okay don't worry I'm going to post one
more video related to the textbook
reading how to approach and do but the
basic idea the second factor of the
basic idea of textbook reading is I'm
not advising you to go through the
textbooks because it is impossible to
cover all the textbooks in a limited
time okay we have spent four years of
our valuable time in the dentistry where
we have not covered any of the textbook
except few students so I'm not giving a
suggestion to go ahead with the textbook
but my ideology is intense who are
recently done with their exam like three
or four months back and I hope they have
studied something from the textbook and
that is going to help them a lot but
repeaters okay don't read textbook but
do carry your textbook for reference for
future reference because MDS conquer
will have expropriating both in the
offline as well as in the online
Institute so you will be having a
specific time for textbook reading so
don't worry don't read textbook but do
follow the group or do follow the
offline center classes and do read the
textbook when the things are going like
what is important what is not will be
differentiated by the mentor you can go
accordingly no need to worry about this
particular aspect of textbook reading
and I'm going to post another video of
textbook reading very shortly so third
important factor to be considered is
again time so always always in this in
this orientation on stressing time time
it's all about time time time that is
more important okay in anything so time
management is an issue for intense okay
because intense half of the time they
spend in the colleges and half of the
time it is for preparation it is for XYZ
accuracy you have so many activities as
an interns they are more energetic and
they're almost like a lead lead team of
the college
okay they have more things to be done in
the college so time management is a big
issue but there are few colleges which
are exception to this okay except few
colleges so if you have if you are if
you feel like my college is not up to
the mark for the further out patient
like
outpatient of the work what you're doing
and if you're if you feel like okay I'm
not doing anything in the internship
take it as an advantage and do
preparation that is more advantage
because the from college some colleges
like government and you call it a few
colleges in any state they have more
opie when compared to the rest of the
colleges who are far away from the city
they have very less okay so don't think
having a less hope is a bad bad bad
thing or a bad aspect for your callers
or for you okay take it as an advantage
you have less opie so you have more time
to read and you can be more focused and
give it of computation to others and
similarly people who are having more
opie try to manage
tydomin is in the best way and try to
conserve that time and try to invest
that in a right way so stress a time
management is a big issue for an intern
but as repeater we'll have more time so
repeaters use the time in the most
effective way because you have more
stress and you have more time so one is
an advantage and one is a disadvantage
but if you overcome you can be
successfully the fourth important aspect
is about the need and the outdated exams
okay I don't want to stress about this
but what I have seen personally because
last year there many students who are
shifting from one Center to other Center
who are shifting from one online disease
to other online testers and we have more
repeaters repeaters they study in one
offline or online Center in the previous
year the rank was not up to mark so now
they repeat with us either in the
offline or in the online so what I
analyze personally when I talk with most
of these candidates who shift from here
to there who jump from here to there is
still most of the mentors unknowingly
they are guiding the students to prepare
for the local exams so two three years
back okay we used to have something
called as local exams the local exams
are state entrances the preparations of
state entrance is totally different and
the updated exam is neat or even the
aims is is updated now previously one
year back games used to be 490 marks now
it is for 200 marks with lots of
variation so everything is being updated
but they're still mentors who are still
guiding you for this outdated local
state and turns examination
they're still focusing the still
teaching that going ahead with the same
classes same people ease
what is my analysis okay and I feel
about come is the failure of a student
it's not a failure of an institute or
it's not a failure of a test series okay
test series or an institute will never
fail they may get good ranks they may
not get good ranks it's not about bad
rounds never know no one is going to
talk about bad ranks they may get good
ranks or they may not get a good rank
series good ranks as good ranks no
that's all who is going to fail is
student I don't want any student to fail
whether that part of our coaching center
and ears conquer or any other coaching
Center in India we all love to see your
success that is more important so please
do to go through because updates are
always important for example if you take
NBD into consideration somebody is going
to change completely the pattern of exam
and everything is going to change in
2020 August if you don't get updated it
doesn't make any sense
similarly to this even if you are in
India or even if you are in any other
country you need to follow the updates
and you need to go ahead with updates
for example if a patient is coming into
your dental clinic and if you are
advising the patient to go for amalgam
registration the patient will not accept
that because amalgam is nobody used
people or got updated in every aspect
right so similarly preparation should
also be updated and don't mind
okay don't mind just go have an analysis
see what is happening then you can
compare and have a better life because
success is more important it's not about
which test series you are being a part
of which online series you are being a
part of or which offline you are
studying very or studying okay this all
stands nothing if we get a rank on the
day of research okay the few people who
used to have a trend like only if you go
to tell me you will get a rank only if
you go to practical place you will get a
rack
no I have seen many people who are
preparing from abroad who are an Indians
and married they are preparing from
abroad and they've got good ranks and
now they have shifted to Judas's I have
seen many people getting good ranks
staying
homes and study okay so just open your
eyes and just think about this important
factor that's going to play a vital role
on the day of result so the second
important aspect about this outdated
exams is previously we used to have
state entrance now we used to have a
neat neat includes all everything so you
have more more more seeds in the need
I'm going to give a rough idea so open
category you have some where 180 odd
seeds okay plus and if you are from OBC
pool you will have somewhere around 30
to 40 seeds if you are from st you'll
have 30 to 35 seeds if you are SC if you
are st you'll have some 15 to 20 odd
seeds these all are included in your so
you have more seeds and of course if you
get into government andrew colors you
have more stuff and when compared with
any other colleges like even in the
state pool that many colleges in india
who are going to pay a stipend of more
than fifty thousand plus which is going
to be a financial support for you and
your family and for your future
dentistry okay so think about this is
this all these are all aspects to be
considered for government dental chorus
okay so I'm done with the part one of
the orientation and we'll be uploading
the second video that is part two will
be uploaded very very soon thank you all
meet you with the second video
