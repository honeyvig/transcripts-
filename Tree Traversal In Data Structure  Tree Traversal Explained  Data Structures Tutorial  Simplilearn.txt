hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning about tree traversal in data
structures
so let's take a look at the agenda for
today's session
first we will begin with understanding
what exactly is tree traversal in data
structures next we will understand the
data structure used for implementing
tree traversal after that we will learn
the types of tree traversals in data
structure
and lastly we will discuss the different
applications of tree traversal in data
structure
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies if you are a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
trends then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simplylearn now without
further ado let's get started with our
first topic that is what is tree
traversal in data structure
tree traversal is a process of visiting
each and every node in a tree data
structure
so right here on my screen we have a
tree with different nodes that is a
b
c
d
and e
so here we will be visiting all the
nodes one after the other using the tree
traversal methods
now that we have a brief understanding
of what exactly is a tree traversal
process let's get into the next topic of
our discussion for today that is the
data structure used for tree traversal
in a tree data structure there are
primarily two data structures utilized
for tree traversal the first one is the
stack data structure and the second one
is the queue data structure a stack is a
linear data structure that operates on
the last in first out lifo principle
there is only one pointer in the stack
that is the top pointer which points to
the stack's topmost element only the top
of the stack is used for insertion and
deletion now the next one is the queue
a queue unlike stacks is open on both
the ends the one end is always open and
used only for input and the other is
only used for deletion or elimination
the principle followed in queue is
first in first out or fifo approach
followed by that we will look into the
different types of tree traversals in
data structure tree traversal can be
done in the following ways the first one
is breadth first search and the second
one is the depth first search
first let us have a look at the breadth
first search algorithm or breadth first
search traversal
we follow level order traversal in
breadth first search
breadth first search traverses notes by
level instead of subtrees first we visit
the root node followed by the root node
we visit the left sub tree of the tree
then followed by the left sub tree we
finished the right subtree of the entire
tree
after that we go until the leaf nodes of
the entire tree is found the second one
is the depth first search in depth first
search we traverse three data structure
in three ways that is pre-order
traversal in order traversal and post
order traversal
let us take a look at how these
traversals are carried out
first let us discuss the pre-order
traversal
we traverse the root node first in the
pre-order traversal then we traverse
through the left subtree and finally we
traverse through the right subtree
then there is in order traversal in
order traversal involves traversing of
the left sub tree first followed by that
we enter the root node then we visit the
right subtree lastly we have the post
order traversal so post order traversal
involves traversing of left subtree
first then the right sub tree and
finally we visit the root node
now next we will have a look at some of
the important applications of tree
traversal in data structure
so we use tree traversal in data
structures to build a prefix expression
or polish notation from expression trees
then utilize the pre-order traversal and
then traverse the expression tree in a
pre-orderly manner
a binary tree's postfix representation
or reverse polish notation can be
generated using post order traversal
because it returns values from the
underlying set in order according to the
comparator setting up the binary search
tree in order traversal is often
employed on binary search trees
a complete binary tree can be deleted or
released when deleting or freezing nodes
and values in the post order traversal
now next we will see an example based on
tree traversal in data structures
so on my screen we have an example for
tree traversal in data structure to
begin we have included the enum or user
specified data type traversal it mostly
used to give integral constant names
which make a programmer easier to
comprehend and maintain
we defined three variables in the enum
data type that is pre-order in order and
post-order traversal we can define the
type that can take one of the two values
by using the typedef and enum keywords
we have a traversal data type with trap
variable and a node data type with node
variable then we define the node using
the data structure type as struct node
we declare one variable x and two nodes
as a left and right nodes respectively
in this node section
we then attempted to create node using
the create node function passing the
root node as an argument in this code we
use a malloc function to create a node
assign data to x and null to both the
right and left nodes before returning to
the root node
if node t is not equal to null we simply
return it otherwise we will use the
released tree function to release the
left and right nodes and if neither is a
root node then we will use the free
function to release the node t which
will behave as the root node
then we define the display tree function
which takes the trap variable and the
root node as parameters
there is a condition in this function
that is if the root node is not null we
will return the root node then using the
switch case scenario we attempted to
traverse the tree using all three types
of traversals
we utilize a trav variable in the switch
function so if any of the in-order
pre-order or post-order variables match
the trap variable the traversal will be
executed then we created a tree using
the create tree function which takes a
data variable as input in the create
tree function we used a malloc function
to create the root node and we first
assigned a null to the left and right
nodes as well as the data to the
variable x before returning to the root
node
we first traverse the root node then the
left subtree and finally the right
subtree in the pre-order traversal case
in order traversal case we first
traverse the left sub tree then the root
node and finally the right subtree and
in the post order traversal case v
traverse the left sub tree then the
right sub tree and finally traverse
through the root node
and finally we exit the display tree
function and move on to the main
function we assign the values 5 as the
root node then 10 20 and 30 as the left
nodes and similarly 15 25 and 35 as the
right notes and then we call the three
tree traversals that is preorder in
order and post order to traverse the
tree and finally we release the root
mode
now let us try to execute this program
and see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and you can see
that the output has been displayed on my
screen so the pre-order traversal is 5
10 20 25 15 30 and 35
followed by the pre-order traversal we
have the in-order traversal that is 20
10 25 5 30 15 and 35 and finally we have
the post order traversal that is 20 25
10 30 35 15 and 5.
and with that let me give you a simple
question
so what is the pre-order and post-order
traversal of this binary search tree so
the elements are 1 2 3 four five six and
seven you need to find out the pre-order
and post-order traversal of this binary
tree and you can let us know the answer
in the comment sections below with that
