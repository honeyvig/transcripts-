hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will
discuss about javascript and typescript
interview questions
if you are planning to attend an
interview then these questions will help
you crack any interview or tease
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simplyla so without
any further ado let's get started
so let's get started with the beginner
javascript questions we have multiple
levels available here we start with the
beginner level first
so the first question is always like
what do you understand about javascript
so we know it very well the javascript
is a very very popular scripting
language it is basically designed for
client-side scripting
and server-side scripting development
why server side because nowadays
javascript is also used in a backend
using node.js so that's why it is also
called for server side development so
the question is like
javascript is
actually also helps the developers to
develop some more responsive html pages
okay which can be well understood and
executed by the web browser
okay which having the support
capabilities for object-oriented
programming skills
now the next question is like what is
the difference between a javascript and
java see the reason is because the
javascript initials are java so
everybody think like okay there is some
relationship with the java so actually
the thing is like there is no
relationship with java i would say
javascript is object based language
whether java is object oriented language
a lot of syntax
and some standards are matching with
java that's why exactly it is saying it
is javascript
otherwise there is nothing like that
but another difference if i talk about
javascript is mainly designed to run
with the browsers where the java is
designed especially for the virtual
machine and operating system
now another thing is like javascript
does not need a compilation because it
is directly used interpreter but when
you talk about java it requires a
compiler as well as the interpreter both
now
what type of various data types are
supported so all standard
data type second byte short inc long
float double character boolean
these all different type of data types
are supported in
javascript also just like in traditional
programming
languages
okay
now
what are the features of javascript so
the first feature which you always
remember
it's it is a lightweight programming
language it is
being interpreted by
the browsers rather than compile
it is a cross platform that means it can
work across multiple browsers so it is
not specific to the browsers
so that we need to understand
next it is an open source hence you do
not need to pay for any licensing fees
it comes free with all different type of
browsers
it is an object oriented but i would not
say it is a pure object oriented i would
rather say it is an object based
language
next it can gel well with multiple front
end as well as the backend technologies
because most of the languages which are
coming up in a market they have a
support available to get integrated with
the javascript and due to that
javascript is very very popular
so it is also used especially for the
development like a network-based
application
so in case if you want to have some kind
of network-centric application here the
javascript really suits very very well
okay
next question what are the advantages of
javascript so the first
advantage which we are talking about
like javascript basically have a very
very nice interactive language
it is a event-based
okay functional programming language i
would say so it is a quick feedback
because it loads very very fast
in your existing web pages
it is
giving you the support of developing a
very very rich
user interface
because of that your application look
consistent across multiple type of
browsers
[Music]
another is like we have a call variety
of javascript based frameworks are
available like you can talk about
angular you talk about react you talk
about vue they're all basically
different type of javascript based
frameworks that helps a developer to
enhance their skills
with writing less amount of codes
so how you create a script or how you
create an object in javascript it is
very simple the curly braces
curly braces is basically designed to
give you the feel of this is a typical
object the variety of ways are there to
create an object in javascript which
we're going to see
in our next vpt
okay
now here we see about the next set of
questions which are there with us
like how to create an array in
javascript
so creating an arrays in javascript is
very very easy now you can see the
square brackets
okay they are the way to basically
create an
array in the javascript so just a square
brackets are a very very simpler way so
called laterals to create
the array objects
in javascript actually you should know
that array is also object which is a
predefined object comes with your
javascript
so called implicit objects
now what are the built-in methods
available in javascript so you remember
about these methods comes from those
built-in objects comes with your
javascript as we have mentioned in our
last slides
like math
boolean
string
okay
date they're all basically predefined
objects are available under those
objects these methods are actually
available like date if you can see it
will display the current date and time
concat to concat two different type of
string push some
adding some new records into your array
pop to remove
around to do the round
length to calculate the length of the
string so these are some well-known
methods or frequently used methods
available in javascript
now what different type of scopes
available in javascript for the
variables now
so
scopes are basically designed to give
you the visibility
within your program
okay so different type of scopes are
available one is called a global scope
so global scope is having the
availability within a file
anywhere else you can access this
particular code or particular variable
that is called global scope and local
scopes are those scopes which are
accessible within a function
and hence cannot be accessed by any
other function or outside of this
function so two standard type of scopes
which are available here
now what is this keyword in javascript
this means to refer the current object
okay so whenever you see that this
keyword it is designed to refer the
current object in
javascript so we typically define that
this keyword to assign the value to my
current object properties
usually this is a place where that this
keyword is mostly used
now what are the conventions of
giving the names to the variables
okay so some standard naming convention
which we should always follow
but few things as you remember there are
certain reserve keywords
are there in javascript which you cannot
offer
while giving the names to your variables
or to your functions
like if i can say var
let
const and many more which are there
available which you cannot assign to
your any existing variable provided or
functions
under your javascript
now
here they are trying to say
variable names cannot begin with any
numeric value like you cannot give
var with abc so not abc i would say
rather one two three or something like
that so they must be a combination of i
would say integer as well as a character
okay so
they must only begin with letter or
underscore characters it is the same
like as we have it in java also
now
naming conventions are very very
important
javascript is a case sensitive hence
the small a and capital a have two
different meanings for the javascript so
that part needs to be well taken care of
now what is the callback in javascript
so you need to understand the callback
in javascript is a kind of function
which you are passing as in parameter to
the other function to execute
okay so callbacks are mainly designed to
tell your application that
they need to wait rather than continue
to execute
so callbacks will help you to behave
asynchronously and that's what exactly
this is most valuable feature of
javascript
so as i discussed already so it is where
the function needs to be passed to get
executed
so how do you debug a javascript code so
to debug your javascript code in any
browser you can just press the f12
no matter which browser you have it
either chrome
or firefox or anyone can just press the
f12 key and there
you can get this option called debugger
where you can just go and perform all
the necessary debugging related stuff
right over there
or
so many other editors like in sublime
text visual studio code
atom they're all offering you the
built-in support to debug your
javascript code
now what is the difference between a
function declaration and function
expression
so this is a very very simple difference
so when you say function abc here
okay so you declare as a separate
statement within the same javascript
code
okay in another example what you do you
define a function within a variable name
called a
which you can create to construct some
another object for this
that's the only difference between these
two
so
this function
can be called before the function is
defined
and this will be created where the
function is pointing
and reaching it
okay so it can be used only after that
so that's what we have discussed it now
going forward
this offers the better code readability
and better code organization and that
the other part is basically used to
create a conditional or declaration
functions
so what are the ways of adding the
javascript code in an html file so they
are
i would say
two ways are available
one
either you can declare it in a separate
file you can add it or second you can
write a embedded javascript code where
you can just write a javascript code
either in your head tag or body tag but
there'll be one difference like if
you're writing it as an embedded
javascript you cannot use it
for the different html file with the
internal javascript file will be limited
to that html however external javascript
will be more useful when you want to
reuse it again and again
so these were some
standard
basic javascript questions for us so
let's go ahead and talk about something
which is related to your intermediate
questions in javascript
now so what do you understand about the
cookies see the cookies are basically a
kind of a small text file okay which is
kept in your browser
and contains the information
about your client activities
okay so whenever the client is accessing
your websites
these websites
can track your activities through this
particular cookies
okay so this just basically record
your general
behaviors like what you're doing with
your website so that accordingly they
can give you
the better recommendations
now how you gonna create a cookie in
your javascript so creating a cookie
cookie is one of the property available
under your document object so that you
can create it using document.cookie and
give a key so
your all cookie
stands with your key and value pair so
you have a key you have a value pair
so how you're going to read the cookie
so cookie you can read with the help of
the same property called document.cookie
and here you can just use this statement
like what key in value pair so whatever
the keys you have defined
similar q will be reading it to give the
value of whatever option you want to
read it
now how you gonna delete the cookie so
cookie can be deleted it very easily by
calling this delete cookie function
where you can just tell about
the time and duration when you want the
cookie to be get deleted
so when you set the expiry time
so cookies are deleted
after specific period of time that will
be treated as a good programming
practice
so what is the difference between a
letter and var keyword see there's a new
feature which is there added called let
keyword which is known as call
block level scope the blockable scope
means
your variable whichever you're defining
under
any block level statement will be
limited to that particular block like if
you're defining it any opening block and
closing block
so beyond that you cannot see that
suppose if you're defining it under if
block
or any block so these
type of variables
are no longer accessible outside where
the var keyword will be typically
treated as a global variable and hence
it can be accessed
anywhere
so what is the closure in javascript so
closure is basically going to give you
a better way of
providing the consistent way of
developing a javascript code for the
developer so closures are basically
created whenever a variable that is
defined outside of this current scope
can be accessed within the
current scope okay that means which is
a variable which is defined outside this
scope
even using the scope
of this particular closure it can be
accessed inside too
now
what are the arrow functions in
javascript friends arrow function in
javascript is very very popular now
they're just gonna give you a kind of
alternative way of defining the function
keyword
these are just a shortcut way of
defining
the function in
javascript these are the simple handy
functions i would say
so what are the different ways of html
can be accessed in javascript course so
there are multiple ways are there so you
can access using document.getelementby
class name
you can access git element by id you can
get access document get element by tag
name and you can say
document.queryselector so these are the
multiple options are there
through which you can access the element
within your html tags
what are the ways of defining a variable
so var keyword as we discussed
you can define a variable
you can also define the variable using
const so if you define any variable
using const so these variables will get
constantly declared and it cannot be
changed
once you define the value so any value
or any variable which is defined using
const
it cannot be changed in later stretches
what are imports and export in
javascript
so to make your javascript modular
so there's an option available of
importing and exporting it
so what exactly the difference
difference is very simple like you are
writing the set of javascript code and
if you want to get it accessed
outside in another javascript file so
how the two javascript files can
communicate with each other that is
where exactly the important export code
comes to make your javascript highly
reused and more modular
now
these are the quick example as you can
see now two different files are there so
if you want to make your particular
variable
or function accessed outside you always
use export keyword with them
and if you want to access them out you
can just use an import keyword
as you can see it is defined there
so
another file can easily access your
the content of the previous files to
make your code even more modular and
useful
so what is the difference between a
document and
window in javascript see document is the
one which is a part of your document
part which user can actually see that
okay so the document object is the
object which falls under the category of
window window is a top level object so
in javascript we have an option
available name called
bom that is called browser object model
in which the top level object which is
there that is called window and under
this we have a call document so whatever
you see
under your browser it is a part of your
document
so what are the some
javascript frameworks
and their uses see javascript frameworks
are mainly useful to make your
application more organized
with less code
and without getting into into the detail
okay so having this particular framework
will give you the opportunity so that
developer can
use the javascript in much more better
way
to write a complex code in more
simplified manner
this is where exactly
your frameworks are designed for so
there are some very prominent and useful
frameworks like in react angular
vue.js and lot many other names are
there and market
which will be using the javascript as a
core and take the entire javascript
development to the next level so the
next question is what is the difference
between a
undefined and undeclared in javascript
say it is very simple
undefined means the variable which is
undefined
you're declaring a variable
okay and which you haven't defined okay
that means the variable has been
declared but the value has not yet
assigned that is called undefined
undeclared means the variable which
you're trying to access that itself is
not available
it doesn't even exist
so what is the difference between
undefined and null in javascript see
undefined as i already told you it means
the variable has been declared but it is
not assigned with any value
null is actually the assignment value
that
we can assign to any variable
which
contain no values as an alternative i
would say so what is the difference
between session storage and local
storage see it is very simple html5 has
offered these features to you
so the session storage and local storage
both offers you the
data which can be stored in a browser
but session storage is short-lived
the moment your page is deleted or
closed the session data is immediately
get deleted whether local storage data
is remain for the longer period of time
and the data doesn't get deleted after
the browser history is over
okay so i would say the local storage
time span is far bigger compared to the
session storage
okay everyone so we'll have some
advanced javascript questions now
we've already seen the beginner level as
well as the intermediate level questions
now it's time to discuss about some
advanced double questions to like the
first questions like comes like how do
you empty an array in javascript so it
is very simple
if you want to assign
so there are few ways are there number
one by assigning the array length to
what to the zero so automatically turns
to empty second
is what by assigning the completely
empty array
okay the third will be by popping up all
the elements of the array
so multiple options are there and the
last which you talk about by using the
splice function so these are the four
important aspects are there
which you can treat how to empty your
javascript
array in a very very simplified manner
now what is the difference between even
capturing and even bubbling see this is
one of the very very common question we
talk about even capturing even capturing
is actually the kind of process
where you just try to
capture the event of
most outer most element and then
propagating it to the innermost element
so even capturing is what like you're
talking about picking up the element
or picking up the event from the
outermost like you talk about called
nested div tags so you pick up the
particular you know even from the most
outer most div tag and you're just
passing it to the innermost then it's
called capturing the bubbling is the
process
okay which starts with the innermost and
goes to the outermost elements this is
an opposite direction that is called
event bubbling
so the question is one of the very very
popular like what is the strict mode in
javascript see the stick mode of
javascript is introduced to give the
more better error handling capacity of
the javascript so whenever you talk
about call strict mode so all variables
have to be declared explicitly so you
cannot leave it like that and it cannot
be assigned to the read-only properties
so we can enable the strict mode only by
adding the user strict mode on the top
of the javascript file
now
what about
and how we would be able to get the
following output of the below javascript
code so we have a call var a equal to 10
and we have written one function in the
if block and after that we're just
capturing the value of a and then you
are printing the value in a console.log
so what would be the
output for that see
it'll be
a call then undefined
once again it'll be kind of what it'll
be undefined how come it would be look
it is very simple
first thing
okay
in your application
you are basically saying the if
condition statement in the code will
evaluate the eval function
as you know very well what exactly the
evaluation is later on the eval
function
okay
will take the function and return the
function abc whatever the function it is
available
and then inside the if statement it
execute the abc and return the undefined
because
as you know it variable the if statement
code execute at runtime but the
statement inside this if condition is
being evaluated
so that's where exactly it is
next can you write the javascript code
for adding the new element in a dynamic
manner yes exactly you can write it down
so you have this very common function
available name called
document.createelement
like people say like i want to add the
new text boxes when i click on the
button
so
i can write it very well so either it
will be a text box or it could be the
new element you want to add it so
document.createelement
is one very very common
i would say the function and later on
you can use the typical dom
functions like i can talk about to
create next node or append child so
using this combination you can easily do
so
next what is the difference between call
and apply very common question so the
call method
whatever the method you have it in a
call
these
method arguments are provided
individually okay along with the this
value but in apply what happens
arguments are provided in the form of
array
along with this value that is the only
difference between call and apply
so what would be the output of the below
javascript code as you can see right now
we've written one object name called
student provided one property called
college with abc
after reducing object dot create passing
this is student as an object itself and
after that you're saying delete
student1.collagenconsole.log
student.com so what would be the value
for this
so it is very simple it is very simple
example of object orientation so the
output will be what abc as we are
accessing the property of
student object so certainly the value
will be what
abc for sure now
what would be the output for below
javascript code as you can see now we
have written a one
function
4 and it is written 11 so we are saying
type of foo so this will certainly refer
to what to the error
reason is why because a function
definition can have only single
reference variable
as its name that's why exactly it will
be throwing what an error to you
how do you remove the duplicate
value from the javascript array it is
very simple we have called filter
function so the filter method i can
basically call it and three arguments it
may be expecting it the name of the
array the current element and the index
of the current element so that it can
remove all the duplicate elements from
there so how do you remove the duplicate
elements
from javascript array so it is same way
i told you like
first it takes three parameters
so using the filter method and by using
the for loop so the empty array is used
for sorting all the repeating elements
so like that you can simply make it more
easy
so how can you draw a simple javascript
dom so you can say it is a very simple
javascript dom elements which are there
where you can have the document and then
the html and followed by all child
elements like an head tag body tag body
may contain further child elements like
an anchor tag
so these are all basically known as
caller presentation elements through
which this complete html hierarchy will
contain inside this we'll first look at
beginner level interview questions
what is typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of javascript
typescript was designed by anders
hichelsburg at microsoft the limitations
of javascript for developing large-scale
applications at microsoft and among its
external customers led to the creation
of typescript because of the difficulty
of working with complicated javascript
code there was a demand for custom
tooling to make developing javascript
components easier
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere javascript is supported in the
browser or nodejs or any other
application
typescript is javascript with some
additional features to support a more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
javascript typescript is a scripting
language that understands javascript and
uses type inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
explain the features of typescript
typescript supports other javascript
libraries typescript is a new microsoft
language that is highly typed superset
of javascript with support for object
oriented programming and other current
features like decorators
because browsers and nodejs comprehend
javascript typescript compiles
javascript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform it can run in any environment
that supports javascript
typescript unlike its competitors does
not require a dedicated virtual machine
or a specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of javascript it
is strongly syntactical that superset of
javascript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a
large-scale application development
language that transcompiles to
javascript existing javascript programs
are also valid typescript programs
because typescript is a superset of
javascript
typescript is static
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can pass null optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some arguments in the
function optional by utilizing optional
parameter features so that the client is
not necessary to supply a value to
optional parameters
object oriented language when it comes
to object oriented programming with
javascript typescript shines
because of the class keyword it makes
object oriented programming look quite
similar to programming in other object
oriented languages like c sharp or java
what are export and import keywords in
typescript
import keyword is used to export
declaration example export star from
module and the export keyword is used to
export any variable function and type
aliases
below is the example for import keyword
and export keyword
can typescript be used for the backend
typescript can be generally used for
back-end applications by using node.js
and having additional safety that the
language brings
how to declare a variable in typescript
let and const are the two methods to
declare variables variable names can
contain alphabets and numeric digits
they cannot contain spaces and special
characters except the underscore and the
dollar sign variable names cannot begin
with the digits below is the example
code where we have declared a variable
with let method and we have declared a
variable inside a function
list the applications of typescript
script can be used to develop javascript
applications for both client-side and
server-side execution
typescript can be deployed instead of
javascript language since it adds more
features and gives error directly with
the code typescript is used for building
large-scale applications for enterprises
how can a base constructor be called
from a child class
a base class constructor can be called
from child class using the super method
as shown in the example
what are getters and setters getters and
sectors intercept access to a member of
the object
they give us a way of having finer grain
control over how a member access each
objects a getter method starts with the
keyword get
and the setter method starts with the
keyword set
what is the purpose of
tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json file is a json format file
in which we can specify different
options to tell the compiler how to
compile a given project this file in the
directory indicates that the directory
is the typescript project root
list the advantages of typescript
typescript highlights errors at the
compilation time during the time of
development
any browser or javascript engine can run
typescript
it has a namespace concept by defining a
module typescript supports strongly
typed or static typing typescript has
the advantages of being tightly typed or
allowing static typing
it may confirm type correctness at the
compile time because of static typing
what are rest parameters in typescript
when the number of parameters that a
function will receive is not known or
can vary we can use rest parameters we
can pass zero or more arguments to the
rest parameters the compiler will create
an array of arguments with the rest
parameter name
how to compile typescript with visual
studio code
visible studio code includes typescript
language support but does not include
the typescript compiler we need to
install the typescript compiler either
globally or in your workspace to
transpile typescript source code to
javascript the easiest way to install
typescript is through node package
manager
the node.js package manager if you have
npm installed you can install typescript
globally on your computer by using this
command npm install hyphen g type script
we can test the installed typescript by
checking the version or help
for this run the command tsc
hyphen hyphen version
list access modifier supported by
typescript typescript supports three
access modifiers
protected private
and public in protected all class
members can access them but the instance
cannot but in private it's only
accessible by members whereas in public
it is accessible by members child
classes and instance of the class
list the disadvantages of typescript the
typescript takes a long time to compile
the code typescript does not support
abstract classes
an extra compilation step for converting
typescript into javascript typescript
has overly complicated typing system
how to debug a typescript file
to debug a typescript file a dot js
source map file is needed to debug the
file
compile the dot ts file with the source
map flag for generating source map file
use the command type script tsc space
hyphen source map file dot ts source
mapping url is equal to file.js.map
how can we convert a string to a number
with typescript in typescript conversion
from a string to a number can be done
using the following commands parse int
method and we have parsefloat method
and number method
explain type aliases
type aliases give a type a new name type
aliases are similar to interfaces in
that they can be used to name primitives
unions tuples and any other kinds that
you would have to define by hand
otherwise
aliasing doesn't truly create a new type
instead it gives that type a new name
aliasing a primitive isn't very useful
however it can be used for documentation
purposes type aliases like interfaces
can be in general
all we have to do is add type parameters
and utilize them on the right side of
alias declaration below is the syntax
for type aliases
what are nullable types in typescript
null and undefined are the two special
types in typescript that have the values
null and undefined respectively they are
not particularly useful much like void
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default
that means you can give things like
number null and undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is said
however null and undefined can only be
assigned to unknown
any and their respective types the one
exception being that undefined is also
assignable to want this helps to avoid a
lot of frequent errors you can use the
union type string null undefined if you
want to send in either a string null or
undefined
what is in operator in typescript
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true branch narrows to types that
have been an optional or required
property n and the false branch narrows
to the types that have an optional or
missing properties in for a n in x
expression as shown in the example below
where n is a string literal or string
literal type
and x is a union type explain index
types in typescript
using index types we can get the
compiler to check code that utilizes the
dynamic property names a typical
javascript pattern for example is to
select a subset of an object properties
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and indexed access operators
in this example k of t the index type
query operator for any type t key of t
is the union of known public property
names of t and t of k the indexed access
operator is the second operator the type
syntax reflects the expression syntax in
this case t of k can be like index type
queries be used in generic environment
which is where it's truly potentially
seen all you have to do now is make sure
that the type variable k extends to k of
t
what are map types
typescript has a feature called map
types that allow you to define new types
based on the existing ones
the new type turns each property into
the old type in the same way in a map
type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to a type rather than a member
you can use an intersection type to add
more numbers as you can see in the
example it is the simplest map type and
its parts are type keys and type flags
where syntax is similar to the index
signatures
with 4 in the middle there are three
sections in total
the type variable k is assigned to each
property one by one
and the literal union of strings the
name of properties to iterate over the
stored in case
and properties type as a result
what is meant by contextual typing
when there is a type on one side of the
equation but not on the other the
typescript compiler finds out the form
we can omit typing on the right side as
typescript can work it out automatically
this increases the amount of work needed
to type code
distinguish between typescript and
javascript typescript is an
object-oriented programming language
whereas javascript is a scripting
language
typescript supports static typing
javascript does not support static
typing
in typescript error can be found and
corrected during a compile time in
javascript errors can be found only
during runtime as it is an interpreted
language
there is support for
es3 es4 5 and 6 in typescript
whereas in javascript no support for
compiling
in typescript functions can have
optional parameters whereas in
javascript this is not possible
in typescript converted into javascript
code
to be understandable for browsers
javascript can be directly used in
browsers
typescript has proper build setup dot
package manager is required for static
type definitions no build setup is
required in javascript
what is jsx
jsx is an xml like syntax that can be
embed it is intended to be turned into
regiment javascript though the semantics
of that transformation will vary
depending on the implementation
typescript allows you to embed jsx type
verify it and compile it to javascript
immediately jsx needs to be translated
into a valid typescript we use the jsx
file with the dot dsx extension
define static typing
static typing refers to a compiler
having variables parameters and object
members that are recognizable at the
compilation type this helps in detecting
early errors static typing as is an
important concept
static typing is when the compiler
enforces that the values use the same
type here's an example
what is meant by type inference
when you don't specify an explicit type
for variable typescript can infer it
type inference is the term for this this
is normally done during the declaration
when the variables or parameters are
initialized
typescript recognizes that the variable
foo is a string even if we don't mention
string as a type
here is an example
how to create objects in typescript
objects are collection of keys and
values that resemble a dictionary the
keys must be one of a kind resemble rs
and are sometimes referred to as
associate arrays
an object type in typescript refers to
any value with properties it can be
defined simply by specifying the
properties and the kinds of these
properties
as an example
explain different data types in
typescript
number both integer and floating point
numbers are represented by the data type
number boolean has true and false values
string it is used to denote a string of
characters
void is usually applied to function
return types
null it's used when an object isn't
worth anything
undefined indicates the value assigned
to an uninitialized variable
any any type of value can be assigned to
a variable if declared with any data
type
what are the benefits of using
typescript
compilation javascript is an interpreted
language
thus there is no need to compile it as a
result it must be run to ensure
authenticity if there is an error you
write all the code only to find no
output as a result you will have to
spend hours looking for false in the
code
error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate
compilation error
this aids in detecting errors before the
execution of the script
the next benefit is it provides an
optional type system for javascript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can pass null
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing
javascript does not have a powerful
static typing system
through the tls typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the tls can deduce the
type of variable defined with node type
based on its value
typescript supports object oriented
programming
typescript support classes interfaces
inheritance and other object-oriented
programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing javascript libraries can use
typescript type definitions
external javascript libraries are
defined in typescript definition files
as a result it can include these
libraries in typescript code
how to install typescript
typescript is a javascript programming
language for use in application
typescript exchange javascript with
optional types that support tools for
large-scale javascript application in
any browser or any host on any other
operating system to install typescript
globally with node package manager which
means you can run the typescript command
from anywhere in your terminal to
install the latest stable version of
typescript you just need to run the
command npm install hyphen g space type
script this will install the latest
version of typescript
what are decorators
a decorator is a type of declaration
that can be used to decorate the class
declaration method accessor property or
argument
decorators take the form
expression where expression must
evaluate to a function
that will be called with information
about the decorated declaration when it
is called at runtime
what are mixins
combining simpler particle classes is a
popular approach of constructing classes
from reusable components for languages
like scala you may be familiar with the
concept of mixins or characteristics
to extend a base class the design relies
on generics and class inheritance the
finest mix in support
in typescript is provided to the class
expression pattern
explain classes in typescript
classes are not supported in javascript
es5 or earlier this feature that
typescript inherits from es6
a class is a collection of items with
similar characteristics fields methods
constructor blocks
nested classes and interfaces are all
included in the classes
below is the syntax to declare a class
in terms of oops a class is a template
for producing objects
what is the name space and how to
declare it
the namespace is used to group
functionalities logically to enable a
single or group of link functionalities
the namespace can include interfaces
classes functions and variables
the namespace keyword followed by the
namespace name can be used to construct
the namespace curly brackets can be used
to define all interfaces classes and
other objects
below is the syntax for namespace
explain the components of typescript
internally the typescript language is
separated into three layers each of this
layer is further subdivided into
language compiler
and language services
language it is written in typescript and
includes typescript language components
it includes syntax keywords and type
annotations
compiler the typescript compiler
converts typescript programs into
javascript code it also converts our
typescript code to javascript code
parsing and type checking it
it provides information that allows
editors and other tools to deliver
greater assistance capabilities like
automated refactoring and intelligence
it adds a layer of abstraction to the
core compiler pipeline
what are the recent advancements in
typescript
typescript 4.2 has been released and it
includes more flexible type annotations
tougher checks and additional
configuration choices and a few breaking
changes
rest arguments can now be placed
anywhere in triple type in type error
messages type aliases are no longer
enlarged resulting in a better developer
experience
typescript 4.2 brings the language one
step closer to its aim of accurately
typing javascript at any size anywhere
javascript is used
describe as syntax in typescript
the as is an additional syntax in
typescript for type assertion it was
introduced as the original syntax
conflicted with jsx
while using jsx with typescript only as
style assertions can be used
define lambda function
typescript provides shorthand syntax for
defining function expressions a lambda
function is an anonymous function
without a name
below is an example for lambda function
what are conditional types in typescript
based on a condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when t can be assigned to you the type
is x and when t can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variables a conditional type t
extends to u
x is to y and is either resolved to x or
y or delayed whether to resolve to x or
y or to differ when t or u contains type
variables is determined by whether the
type systems has enough information to
conclude that t is always assignable to
you
what is an interface with reference to
typescript
the interface defines the syntax for
classes to follow a class implementing
an interface implements all its members
it can be referenced but not
instantiated typescript compiler uses an
interface for type checking
what is a declare keyword in typescript
as javascript does not have typescript
declaration to use it in the typescript
file without any compilation error
declare keyword is used
the keyword is used for ambient methods
and declarations to define a variable
that exists elsewhere
now we will look at advanced level
interview questions
what are object oriented principles
supported by typescript
all object-oriented principles
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
and obstruction are supported by
typescript
encapsulation is a major component of
object-oriented programming language and
its method of structuring code so that
each block of code has its own set of
access points for external code
polymorphism occurs when many class
inherit from the same parent and
override the same functionality
each of those kit classes is now
responsible for implementing a property
or method
but they may do so it on their own
unique way
inheritance
typescript makes creating an object
model and inheritance chain a breeze to
construct classes
simply use the standard class keyword
abstraction is a method of modeling
objects in a system that separates the
responsibilities of the classes or type
from the code that inherits it
explain index signatures in typescript
index signatures interact with the key
of and t of k
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature key of t will be a string
or a number because in javascript we can
access an object property using either
string or numbers and t of string is
simply the index signatures type
the index signature consists of the
index name and its type in square
bracket
followed by colon and the value type
what are assert signatures
the asset signature features allows us
to construct functions that operate as
type guards as a side effect instead of
returning their boolean result
explicitly
after a search string typescript has no
way of knowing if you have guaranteed
the type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
but it also moves the type of checking
problem somewhere and in circumstances
where you just want to fail hard having
the option is beneficial
what is type assertion explain its types
a type assertion is similar to a type
cast in other languages but it does not
do any additional data verification or
restructuring it has no effect on
runtime and is only used by the compiler
there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax other is the angle
bracket syntax
below is the example for async tax and
angle bracket syntax
explain how typescript files can be
supported from node modules
typescript includes a series of
declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one is while upgrading typescript we
must deal with changes to typescript's
built-in declaration files
and the other is customizing these files
to meet the needs and the demands of
project dependencies is difficult
a new feature like at the rate types was
added that allows to override the
specific built-in library then we can
update typescript and the log file in
dependency management ensuring that it
utilizes the same version of the dom
types as a result we can update the
types on our own schedule
explain the typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript it builds a component that
can interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
the identity function now has a type
variable called type
this type allows us to capture the type
of data the user supplies for example a
number or a string so that we can use it
later we are going to utilize type as
the return type once more below is the
syntax for typescript generics
what is recursive type aliases
the ability to recursively reference
type aliases has always been eliminated
the reason for this is because each type
aliases must be capable of substituting
itself for whatever it aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliases cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type aliases and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces
it's effective
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and the other object
types because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
explain tale recursion elimination on
conditional types
when typescript identifies infinite
recursion or any type expansions that
take a long time and damage your editor
experience
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while working with types
that provide a lot of intermediate
results
the trim left type removes spaces from
the beginning of string like type when
provided a string type with a space at
the beginning trim left returns a
reminder of the string to the user
advanced typescript removes tail
recursion from conditional types it can
prevent
intermediary instantiations as one
branch of conditional type is merely
another conditional type
explain the awaited type and promise
improvements this type is intended to
represent activities such as await in
async functions
and the dot then method on promises
notably the way they recursively unwrap
promises
existing apis such as javascript
built-ins like promise.all promise.trace
and others can benefit from the awaited
type in fact some of promise dot all's
inference concerns provided as
foundation for awaited promise dot all
combine certain traits with the awaited
to produce far superior inference
results
