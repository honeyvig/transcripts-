hello everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel
today we will be discussing about tower
of hanoi problem in programming but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for latest
technological advancements
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn now without any
further audio let's get started with the
agenda for today's discussion
we'll begin this discussion by
understanding the torah of ana problem
along with how we can construct a
solution for it
followed by that we'll develop the c
program which can solve this torah of
inner problem
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with our
first topic which is understanding the
tower of ni problem
the tower of hanoi is a mathematical
puzzle made up of three towers and
multiple rings arranged in ascending
order of their diameters the number of
rods or tower is fixed whereas the
number of rings can be changed by the
player
the setup of this game looks something
like this there are three towers in this
diagram and one of the tower is decked
with several number of discs or rings
such that the largest disc is at the
bottom and the smallest desk is at the
top
a player's goal is to move these discs
one at a time to a particular
destination tower in the same specific
configuration at the start that means
the order of disk should not be changed
after being transferred to the
destination tower
before you get ahead of yourself and
deem this problem to be trivial there is
one crucial aspect to consider
in this problem you are not allowed to
transfer a larger disk on the top of a
smaller disk at any stage
this rule makes solving this problem
substantially difficult
however this problem can be solved using
the auxiliary tower or helper tower by
altering the position of disc using
three towers we can take all the disc
present at source forward to the
destination tower this is quite
confusing right
so to make this understandable to all of
you let me give you a rough example in
this tower of hannah problem we have
three rings at the source tower now to
attain the same sequence at the
destination tower we'll move the top two
rings to the helper tower
after that we can move a ring with
highest diameter to the destination
tower
now if we just move the two rings
present at the helper tower to the
destination tower we'll solve our
problem but let me tell you guys that
this explanation was just to make you
visualize this problem more
straightforward manner in reality this
problem becomes more complex when the
rules for the movement of rings are
applied
so moving forward let's look at those
rules for ring movement in the tower of
another problem the first rule that we
have is at any instance only one disk
can be moved from the tower that means
we cannot move more than one disk at a
time
the next rule on our list conveys that a
disk can only be moved if it is the
uppermost disk of the stack
the last and essential rule is no disk
should be placed on the top of another
disk that is smaller in size
so let's look at another tower of ni
problem to build solution using these
set of rules
in this problem we have four disks to
increase our problems complexity whereas
the number of towers remain the same
in order to formulate the solution we
are allowed to move these rings into
different towers so the first move we
are supposed to do is moving the orange
disk to the helper tower
next we can move green disk to the
destination tower and after that we can
move the orange disk to the destination
tower
we'll place this orange disk over the
green disk
now our helper tower is empty so let's
take out our yellow ring from the source
tower to the helper tower
now we'll move the orange ring to the
source tower
further we'll move green ring to the
helper tower
this movement will make our destination
tower empty so that we can bring this
larger disk to it
next we'll move orange ring to the
helper tower this move will make room
for the transfer of largest disk to the
destination tower
now
we have brought our largest disc to the
destination tower however we still need
to bring three more discs to our
destination tower in order to solve this
toh problem
and to do that here we'll move orange
ring to the destination tower
and the green ring to the source door
after that we'll move orange ring to the
source tower in order to bring the
second largest
ring to our destination tower here we
have successfully placed two rings at
the destination tower now we only left
with arrangement of two more rings to
attain that here we'll move orange ring
to the helper tower
and green ring to the destination tower
finally we'll move orange ring to the
destination tower
and this is how we'll land that accurate
solution to our tower of anna problem if
you observe this process you'll get that
the process of ring movement is of
recursive nature and we can develop a
solution to this problem using recursive
programming paradigm
so moving ahead we'll develop a program
to implement a solution to the store of
any problem
the language that we are going to use
for this implementation is c programming
language
so without wasting any time let's move
to the code editor
here to begin with our tour of an
implementation
let's first create an utility function
named toh
so we'll do that void
toh
and inside this function will pass few
arguments the first argument will pass
to this function will be the number of
rings in our toh problem so let's call
that variable n
and the subsequent arguments will be the
source tower destination tower and
helper tower all these three arguments
will be of character data type as we
want to pass the names of towers here so
we'll create
care
source
next
care
destination
and care
helper
tower
next now inside this function body will
make recursive call to the same function
in order to move the disk
inside this recursive call will tell our
ide to move n minus 1 disk from source
store to the helper tower
and to do that the statement that we'll
write is
t o h
move n minus one disk
that is this n
next will be the source
then helper
underscore t which will act as
destination here
and
destination power will act as an
helper tower
so basically this call is nothing but
these arguments over here
this recursive call will allow n minus 1
rings to move from source store to the
helper tower by taking the help of
destination tower so by using this
statement we have moved n minus 1 rings
from source to the helper tower next
what we'll do is we want to print all
these movements covered by this function
hence let's create a format for printing
the disk movement using printf function
the format that we'll use is
printf
add slash n
next
move
disk
modulus d
from
tower
modulus c
to
tower
modulus
c
and after this by taking comma will pass
arguments
the first will be modulus d that is
number of tower
next will be the source
and after that it will be destination
so by moving n minus one disk to the
helper tower we have made space for
moving the largest disk to the
destination top and next we'll have to
move this n minus one rings to the
destination tower from the helper tower
by using the source node
so
for that we'll write another recursive
call toh
n minus 1
comma helper underscore t will act as
source now
and destination
will act as destination
whereas source
will act as
helper toggle
now what will be the base case for this
recursive function well it's pretty easy
the recursive call we are making is
actually decreasing the disk number that
is n minus 1 and thus after few
iteration the value of n will become 0
and when it reaches 0 we want to stop
our recursion so our base condition will
be
f
n
becomes equal to zero
we will
return the control to the next function
so with this we have successfully
created our tour of ener function next
we'll move to our driver method that is
main method in order to contemplate the
toh function
so what we'll do is we'll pass
arguments to toh function
the number of rings that we are going to
use for this problem will be 4
and let's call our towers as
a
then b
and
c
and return 0
now let's check if our code works fine
or not
okay so we are getting one error over
here semicolon missing
okay so let's add that semicolon and
re-run our code
okay so we have received output here the
output is 15 steps that we have
discussed earlier for the four ring stoh
problem
and that output is what we have received
here that means our program works
accurately you can verify this output by
matching these movements with the
previous solution that we have discussed
earlier
the only thing to note here is that the
tower b is acting as destination tower a
is acting as source and tower c is
acting as helper tower
