foreign
YouTube channel today we are going to
create a location tracker using a phone
number and Python and before proceeding
I have an insight for you guys that is
if you are aiming to get certified as an
AI and ml engineer and want to build a
career in AI in that case you can check
the professional certificate program in
Ai and machine learning that is in
collaboration with IBM and Purdue
University by simpler that will open the
doors for the best care opportunities
and to find the details of this
professional certificate program that is
in Ai and machine learning you can check
the link in the description box below
and we'll also mention the link in the
pin comment
you can go through the course
and just check it out
and we have some testimonials also if
you want to see the review of these
courses
and moving on I have a question for you
guys
and your question is
which of the following modules needs to
be imported to handle date time
computations in Python and your options
are the first option is date the second
option is date time and the third option
is time date and the fourth option is
time
so please answer in the comment section
below and we'll update the correct
answer in the pin comment you can pause
the video give it a thought and answer
in the comment section
and moving on now we will start a
project that is track phone number
location using python
so for that
first we'll create a folder for our
project you could also create a virtual
environment
but
I'm not going to do that you guys can
create if you want to just keep your
project aside from all other projects
and don't want your modules to get
conflicted with any other module
so I will name a nice track
and inside this I will open the command
prompt
and I will use the ID that is Visual
Studio code for that I am writing the
command code space period and press
enter in the command prompt
so it will open my ID
Visual Studio code
and here I will create a new file and
name it as
new DOT py
and before starting with the project the
first thing we should do is install and
import libraries that we need for our
project
so we'll start with installing and
importing the libraries
so we will import
the first Library there would be phone
numbers
I will show you you can just simply
write pypi that would be the PIP
installation command for
the particular Library you can just
search pypi and the name of the library
you want to install in any browser
will get these kind of web pages and
inside you could see the command to
install that and here you can find
some of their descriptions and their
download files release history and home
pages so we'll just copy the command
move back to our Command Prompt or you
could use the terminal of your ID
you could use any to install your
modules
so I'm using command prompt and I have
copied my command as you can see it
states that the requirement is already
satisfied
that means that on this system I have
this module already installed so I don't
need to install it again
and portfolio we'll just copy it and
move back to a command prompt and paste
the command
and click enter
you can see that the requirement is
already satisfied as I've already
installed these modules so I don't need
to install them again and there's
another that is open cage so we'll use
it to
point out the location on the map
so for that also you could just copy the
command get back to command prompt or
your terminal of your ID and press enter
and it will get to modules installed it
states that the requirement is already
satisfied as I've already cleared that I
have already installed these modules
so moving back to our ID
we'll start with importing our libraries
so we'll import the necessary libraries
that is phone numbers that is used to
pass phone numbers geocoder
will call the class from the phone
numbers that is geocoder which is used
to determine the location of a phone
number and will use volume which is used
to create Maps it will also assign a
value to a variable key
so we'll start with importing
and first you will Import phone numbers
okay
moving on
now we will import geocoder from phone
numbers class
okay
now we will also import volume we'll use
it
later on but yeah and we will also
create a file
uh for our phone number
so that we can just import the phone
number from that file and I won't be
showing you the phone number so you guys
won't be like spamming or misusing it I
know you won't miss use but yeah I will
not mention it
so for that
I will
take the file name as test.py and here
we'll just create a variable
and name test number and inside
we'll just write the phone number
okay
and get back to a file that is new node
py we have imported the libraries now
we'll create second file for phone
number that we have created now we'll
start with creating a variable and we'll
name it as check number and use the
phone numbers library and the pass
function parser phone number
so to do that first we'll create a
variable and name it as check number
and we'll use the pass function of
phone numbers Library
and inside will pass the number that we
have stored
into
the other file but to access that
variable from the other file we need to
import that file so from test
that is test.pi that is in the same
folder we will import the variable
number
okay
we have imported it
now okay just return number
now it's number
okay moving on now we will use the
geocoder class and use the description
for number
I will show you guys
what I am going to use
that is we'll use the jio code
geocoder.description phone number
function to determine the location of
the phone number and that to in English
language
so for that we'll create a variable and
name it as number location okay
number underscore
location
and inside this we'll use the geocoder
class
and what function values description
phone number
you could see this is the second
function so we are using this and inside
this what will pass we'll pass the
variable check number in which we have
passed the phone number
so we will pass this check number
and
we will ask it to provide the result in
English language for that we have used
en
okay
and after that what we need we need the
number location that is stored in the
variable we want to print it
so we'll just simply print it that would
be number
underscore
location
okay that is then
and now
if you just
run this
you will get the output as location that
is India and the most important thing
these libraries will tell you the
countries note the particular States
like it will these libraries try to
depict the particular state but they are
not such particular they will give you
the countries in which these phone
numbers are situated
okay
well where these phone numbers are
active
so we have done with the location
now we also want to extract the career
not career but the career that the
mobile service provider that is if in
India we talk about we have mobile
service providers that is jio Airtel
Vodafone idea psnl and if we go out so
we have nine mobiles and others so we
want those service providers okay yes
that is mobile careers
so for that
now we'll
use the phone numbers libraries again
and for that we will import the career
class
so for that we'll write from
phone numbers
import
area
okay sorry
now we have imported the career class
now we'll use a function that would be
career dot name for number function that
is in the career module that we have
imported from phone numbers
so for that first we'll create a
variable and name it as
service provider
okay and inside this variable what we'll
use is we'll use the phone number dot
parse first we have done that
in the check number variable also
so you could use the check number
variable or we could just simply pass
the phone number again here so for that
we'll just write phone numbers library
and use the pass function
and that is inside will pass the number
in which we have stored our number
okay
we have passed it
and now
no
we'll use the
career.name for number function and for
that we'll directly print it out
or you could store in a variable that's
your choice we will directly print it
that would be career
Dot
and you could find the functional name
for valid number no
that is name fundament that is the first
one and inside will pass the pass number
that we have stored in a variable
service provider or you could use the
check number
so we'll just pass service provider
and
will pass anything that would
we need
the
credit provider name in English
so we are passed en okay so this code
has used career dot name for number
function that is used to read minus
service provider of the phone number
that is in English
we have done that so we'll just save the
file
and run it
so you could see that states Tata docomo
I will run it again for you guys
now it has printed both things that is
the number location that is India and
the service provider that is started
docomo and what this Library does is if
you get your number ported it won't show
the current service provider it shows
when you have just
get your Sim the first time the first
service order it will show you that that
is
okay now moving on we will use the maps
to point out the location
so for that we'll use the open cage
module as we have already installed that
so we'll import jio coder or open cache
jio code from
the open kids module
so I will show you what will import that
is from
module
will import openk jio code glass yeah
the first one open gate jio code
okay
now
what we need is the key of open cage so
I will show you guys
will open the open cage
and you guys have to
enter that I have already login
so this is
the dashboard and we'll go to geocoding
API
and we'll use the free one free trial
and one time plan customers can have
only one active API key at a time okay
we'll use this only
and I will just like I won't show you
guys
so I will just blur it out
so I'll paste the key here
and coming back
so here we'll use the key so for that
we'll create a variable first
and name it as geocoder only
so jio coder and use the open KGO code
and inside we'll pass the key
but we have stored in a variable key
and now
we want the number location in a string
so we'll store it in our variable
for that we will just write query equal
to string and inside will
store the parse number as a string so
we'll pass the variable in which we have
passed the phone number that is number
location
and now we'll use the geocoder dot jio
code function and pass the query into it
so for that will create a function a
variable and name it as results
and we'll use the geocoder
and use the geocode function and inside
will pass the query that is the variable
in which we have stored the pass number
that is as a string and now what we want
is latitude and longitude of the
location
so for that we'll create a variable and
name it as latitude
and
from the results variable
we will just
okay let it equal to from the results
variable
we'll just take the
zeroth index
and
we will
take the geometry
and the latitude
and for longitude we'll do the same that
is in this code what we are doing is we
are importing the openk jio code class
from the open case dot geocoder module
which is used to get the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the location of
the phone number
it then initializes an instance of the
class with the API key that we have
stored in the variable key and then the
code creates a query variable but we
have created that is with the value of
number location and we'll use the
geocoder.geocode method to get the
latitude and longitude coordinates of
the location of the phone number that we
are doing now these coordinates are then
stored in the variable that is lat that
is we will store latitude in that and
we'll store the longitude in the LNG
variable and finally that latitude and
longitude longitude coordinates we will
print them in the console okay
so
now we will just get the longitude
so for that we'll use
results
and inside we'll use geometry
and the longitude
okay
so now we'll just print the latitude and
longitude
okay I will save this and
run this
so you could see the first thing it has
printed is the current location that is
India then the service provider and then
the latitude and longitude you would
just copy these latitude and longitude
and paste on a map or you could just
search on a any browser it will show you
the coordinates on a particular map
where these are
and to get the pointer
on a map we will use the folio module so
I will show you guys how we'll do so
we'll use the volume dot map function
that is the map function from the folio
module and we'll pass the latitude and
longitude coordinates that we have
stored in the variables latitude and
longitude and then the volume dot marker
function will use the marker function
from the folio module class volume
module and it will show the marker on
the map so
to do that I will show you guys I will
do we have imported the volume module
and first we'll create a
variable
and we'll store the file in an in an
HTML format so you could just open in
any browser and you could see the map
so in this variable we'll use the map
function
so volume
that is equal to
volume dot map and inside
use location and that is equal to
latitude
Uma
longitude
and
what we need to set Zoom
zooming can set Zoom start
and we'll set it as 9. you could set as
you want
okay
so we have set it as nine and now we'll
use the marker function so
for that
we'll just use the marker function
dot marker
and inside we'll pass the latitude and
longitude
okay
and we will just pop up the number
location for that will set
pop-up
and that would be equal to
the past number
okay and we'll use the add to function
that is
root add to and inside this will pass
the variable map location in which we
have stored the
so we'll pass map location okay
we have passed this and we want to save
this map location in an HTML format
so we'll use map location
dot save
and we'll name the file as
my location
go to HTML okay
so I'll save the file in an HTML format
so you guys could just open that and use
it so we have run the
program and you could see it has stated
that India Tata docomo and the letter U
and longitude and you could see in the
same folder that we have the my
location.html file
so we'll get back and you could see my
location we'll just open it and you
could see that it has pointed out into
the map that is the phone number belongs
to the India
and we'll get
check it out
now I will change the phone number and
test this
for a different phone number so put that
I will write
obviously I won't be showing the phone
number
what the phone
yeah
we have saved it and
the new DOT pure file we will run it
for this
phone number and
put C
Nevada
and the latest and it has notified the
service provider
okay
we'll run it again
okay
look it won't be able to
find out the service provider and the
location for this phone number has been
saved in the dot HTML file so we'll just
open it
and
check okay yeah the pointer is located
near Nevada
so our project is working fine and if
you want
not to store the phone number in like
the other file
you could just do it you would just get
the phone numbers entered in the console
so for that you just guys have to write
a small line for enter
ing the phone number
so first we'll do is I will show you
guys how to do that
and just get this
so we have commented the module that is
the test module and now to get the phone
number input
from the user will use the same variable
number in which gives stored the phone
number earlier
and we'll use
input and here we will write
enter
phone number
with
country code
okay
with the country code you guys have to
enter it
and if I run it
so here
I will enter
and I will
get this also blurred so it will take a
little
time for editing also you guys can see
India Tara docomo latitude and longitude
and
the file has been updated that is the my
location.html
and if I open this you could see that it
has pointed in India
and and with that
we have come to the end of this session
