hi Venus back here with the local
anaesthesia part okay so before going
into the topic okay so even if it is not
a live class the most common things that
I have encountered in the last one week
in the phone calls and as well as in the
messages is these two things okay
so always pointing someone or some X
apart from you for your failure okay
last year I was not successful I did not
clear my exam the reason was this okay
now I'm not able to do the reason was
this okay so I'm not going to talk about
the X person the person can be anything
sometimes can be a good friend sometimes
can be your parents or your family
members because I have seen many such
cases where the main issue what you're
pointing is just my parents are not
allowing me to read they are not giving
me the permission they are not giving me
the scope okay so XY jet so my
suggestion for all of you is whatever it
may be
okay whether you are with the best rank
on the day of result or with the worst
rank on the day of result the person who
is going to get hundred percent is
credit is you okay he if you feel that
your parents or your your best friend or
some good persons in your circle were
spoil your preparation means it is you
that is behind the particular individual
for example your parents are not
allowing you to study they're not
allowing you to do ambience they're not
happy with your preparation okay means
that is you how to take a move to
explain your parents or to explain the
particular person that how important is
the preparation for you okay how
important is this exam for you
professionally so that you will get into
good college or I may get into good
college I will get I'll be like this the
stoy friends will be like this or the
faeces will be like this if I get a free
seat these are the consequences that
- how and these are the benefits that we
are going to have professionally and
financially so it's you that how to
explain everything to your parents okay
because like I feel like only five
percenters or like one to two percenters
or the parents know what is really
happening in the industry what is the
scope of Dentistry rest most of us like
97 to 98 percentage of parents they
don't know what is the scope and what is
the liability of dentistry they just
know that dentistry okay he treat us he
treats the teeth or he's called as a
dental doctor that most of her peers
they don't they even the branches or
even the subjects that were present in
the dentistry okay it's you that you
have to take some time explain the
parents about the consequences and
explain the patient explain the parents
about the upcoming future in the
dentistry so that the person who is
going to stop you or prevent you from
successfully is going to understand like
what is really happening here okay so
the main characters in the preparation
according to me it's always you you are
the only character whether you're
successful you're the only character
whether you're failure so that is the
first note I want to make it very very
clear don't don't don't throw the reason
or your failure on some someone someone
okay maybe him but it's always you
behind them who are the primary reasons
okay so the second factor that I'm going
to discuss today is the fear factor okay
I think today morning I got a call okay
from the old student who is repeating
the examination it's not the first call
I used to get regular text messages from
the old students and people who has this
fear factor okay fear factor is the
primary reason for most of us like fear
of failure like why we study for the
university exams most of us we study for
the university exams including me last
one month last ten days last one day
last overnight I used to do hell of the
work
because it's not that I want to be the
university topper it's not that I want
to be the topper or a distinction
candidate holder it's always the main
factor is fear of failure I have a fear
of failure and I take that as a primary
concern I read duels and similarly I'm
not talking about the people who has to
start the preparation who have
nowhere bothered about the preparation
they don't worry about fear of failure
because need exam is not mandatory Sam
if you want to get updated to the next
level this is one of the option and this
is the best way of option but university
exams which you give at the end of the
year are mandatory and if you fail you
will be separated from your batch mates
right you will be separated from your
respect to batch mates and that
separation is the main reason of fear of
failure and that is the primary theology
why most of us like 90 percentage of us
really I'm not talking about the 10
percentage of Distinction candidates are
the people who treat from day one or
college university stalkers or college
toppers
but I'm bothered about this 90 percent
tears of the people in which I am
included I have that fear of failure
that I if I fail in this exam I'll be in
the same year I my batch mates are going
to get promoted so that fear of failure
made me too ready for study for the
University exams but it doesn't happen
with me or with most of us in the need
entrance or any sort of PG entrance exam
okay so so if you have this fear of
failure this fear is your driving force
because there there should be some fear
to drive you through the preparation
okay so fear should be there because
fear will drive you into the preparation
will force you to work hard in the
preparation but how to overcome and
manage the fear fear like the few people
who are psychologically feeling ill at
the end of the day that whether I'm up
to this mark or not whether I can etch
you this or not so always there is a
one-one saying of always when you are
with MDS concur always think positive
so universe is surrounded by lots of
molecules if you think positive the
positive will happen whatever you say is
going to happen if you say good good
will happen if you say bad bad will
happen so taking this in words into
consideration don't ever talk back about
your preparation or about yourself
let's talk good because good is going to
happen definitely for sure okay so
taking these two important notes into
consideration this video I'm just going
to move further into local anesthesia
part two okay so I have already
discussed about the classification the
basic pharmacology classification which
has divided it into esters and amides so
it's just again divided into benzoic
acid and paraben generic acid you can
identify paraben tannic acid with throw
and only stir which has to Isis this
rest all oysters will have only one line
coming to MIT amides easy way to
identify this emerged always will have
two eyes you can see all their meds will
have two eyes so that's well I'm moving
ahead okay yesterday I was discussing
some stuff related to the medical
emergencies where I have given few hints
that endotracheal route is the most
fastest route of activation right so the
next comes is the if you if you see this
is the time to reach the peak
intravenous please do make a note about
the angle of insertion of the injection
for all this okay which was asked in
2017 question and which was done and
they both whereas today's class right
done I'm just moving ahead okay so so
what happens we are done with the site
of injection that site can be any of the
modes like IV or anything but finally
the product reaches the blood from blood
it's going to distribute to all the
areas so there is to two aspects of
getting
equilibrium one is the slow equilibrium
and second one is the rapid decay
so rapid equilibrium is mainly within
the brain heart that is myocardium lungs
and liver whereas the slow equilibrium
is in the fat and the muscles note that
which equilibrium everything right so
what is slow slow comes which and where
do the rapid equilibrium is going to
come so I was talking like we need to
talk about a few things about the
half-lives right half life I hope you
know the basic definition of half life
half life is the amount of time required
to decrease the product of 100 molecules
250 half of it okay so most of your
questions will move around the highest
and the lowest so already discuss the
lowest is chloro propane and propane
whose the lowest values and that's the
reason by clora protein is most commonly
used in children easy to remember it
starts with C and it starts with C right
and the maximum I have already discussed
that is the Whoopi what kind okay what
kind is the maximum with 3.5 3.5 hovers
of half life okay
so apart from this most commonly used
buyers in the market right now is little
kinds of to make an order but little
friend values and ladokern is almost the
same as pretty low kind
okay so most of the values they move
around one point six to one point and
you can remember all these values right
one point six to one point nine and the
lowest and highest unmeritorious
sometimes they can give half-life based
questions by giving the value for
example the half-life of a particular
drug is this they can give you the
chloro broken has a half-life of 0.1
over that is six minutes right zero
point one over six minutes they can
mention the half-life and in sometimes
they will not mention the half-life
value you have to remember the off life
value and you have to solve the progress
and all these problems will be a part of
your general form of ecology okay don't
worry about them we're going to discuss
them in detail on the group but make a
note but the half-life value of highest
and lowest is important apart from that
it is mandatory that you have to learn
one two
three and four for the sake of example
so I'm done with the half-lives I'm
moving ahead so this is I mean basically
application based questions right
application based question condition
which are layer to be given which shall
a to be avoided and everything so first
of all I am going to discuss like as
already discussed the contraindications
can be categorized into two types
absolute contraindication means you
should never try relate to you can try
with some sort of abnormality and some
sort of risk so the two absolute
contraindications are the one and two
that is allergy is always an absolute
contraindication you can see local
anaesthetic allergy was documented
nowadays documentation will be on the on
the other on your like case sheet but
previously we used to have some tattos
you can see those tattos pictures on in
your muhammad or they are going to give
a brass light on which they are going to
write about the ellipsis okay they're
going to get write about the allergy so
they're going to keep a tattoo on the
body telling that this patient is a
legit achter this okay nowadays we have
the documentation so any sort of
question can be given to you but make a
note okay if there is a clear-cut
documentation that the patient is a
legit ik or the patient is having be
sulphate allergic make sure it is
absolute contraindication
okay so absolute contraindication right
so the next important point so the
patient is a legit ik than all the local
anesthetics in the same class for
example if the patient is allergic to
oysters then you can try emits if the
patient is a legitimate then you can try
mister right you can try the other class
the solution is you can try the other
class second one is bissell fatality
okay sulfate allergy is mainly an
ingredient that is present in the vas of
chemists or that is present in the local
anesthetics containing vasoconstrictor
so it is it is mostly related to the
vasoconstrictor so you go with LS
without massive canister - that is a
solution so next part is the relative
contraindications these are the
abnormalities or or the other or the
pathophysiology that are present in the
body okay the first one is a typical
plasma
mistress already discussed that Easter's
are going to get metabolized in the
plasma right whereas your amides are
going to get metabolized in the form of
liver right so plasma it is metabolized
by an enzyme called s plasma
cholinesterase so whenever you have an
abnormality with the plasma colonists
stress it is better to avoid Easter's
right it's better to avoid Easter's then
what what we have to do better to go
with the leftover class that is emerge
right so the next one I'm going to talk
about is myth hemoglobin II me or
idiopathic or congenital any sort of
miss myth hemoglobin emia has already
discussed it is mainly concerned with
pre loci it's mainly concerned with
brillig and so you can go with pre LOC
and Antarctica and are also concerned
with this abnormality so you can go with
other unless okay the next one is liver
dysfunction or liver diseases okay yes
yeah I hope you have you had a note
about a si is a classes class 1 class 2
class 3 class 4 classify classics what
does it mean and what does it reflects
is I get a most commonly asked question
which will be dealing in the further
classes but make a note if you have a
liver problem then as I'd already
discuss the Danites are going to get
breakdown in the liver so I might should
be avoided then you have to go further
Easter's if you have a renal problem
okay a renal problem is a condition
where whatever it is like whether it it
is metabolized in the plasma or whether
it is metabolized in the liver the final
output will be the kidney to eliminate
it right so if you have a renal problem
most of the local anesthetics are
contraindicated and if it is mandatory
that you have to go for the uses of
local anesthesia then you need to plan
some dialysis or anything to the patient
to remove the remnants of LD so next
course is the cardiac problem no I hope
you have very familiar with this leg
whenever you have hypertensive patient
or whenever you have some cardiac
problem patients the most common thing
that you need to contraindicate is high
doses high concentration of the
vasoconstrictor then you need to go over
either plain earlier or with the low
doses of vasoconstrictor the same goes
with hyper
paradism hyperthyroidism of patients
will have hypertension in the same go
state whether it can be tired a
toxicosis or anything right make a note
that local anesthesia vasoconstrictor is
avoided and you need to go for less
level of basic constructs so these are
the most commonly asked application
based questions related to the
contraindications of le okay so I'm
going to move to the next one I hope
you're very familiar with this what is e
ml okay there's a full form make a note
and if you want the definition make a
note because this is again a common
thing for your dental materials to make
a note the melting point of this mixture
is lower than the melting point of the
individual components and the most
commonly used product is this one that's
2.5 percentage of Lido kind plus 2.5
percentage of pillow kind is okay a few
other things that you have to make a
note about MLA which will be discussed
on the Krypton where I'll be sharing the
pic with clear underlining indications
contraindications mode of action many
other things which are very very
important so before going before that
and as already discussed in the morning
note that there's one more
classification which is based upon the
biological action so categorized into a
b c and so which is going to act which
is going to act which is the most common
thing apart from the definition of the
each class is the examples biotoxins
comes under a whereas your quaternary
ammonium compound and a lots of judoka
and scorpion venom comes into be and the
most important thing are the last two
allowed to ask questions on the last two
that is your pincher kind comes and
see and you were clinically used and as
most of your clinically used Elias will
come center of the class day so the
questions are most of the clinically
used Elias comes in to be Judith kind
comes under Dean ok quaternary ammonium
compounds which looks like a dog and
comes under B okay so biotoxins comes
under a so this biological side
classification is again an important
aspect that you have to make and not so
I already told there is one more
classification which is based upon the
duration of action right so in which
Elias are divided into shorter duration
intermediate duration long duration
shorter durations of 30 minutes that is
pol pol anesthesia is approximately 30
minutes
intermediate duration is 60 minutes and
it is 90 minutes very simple to remember
so most of the questions will be very
simple you can see that shorter duration
is mostly without any Vasa constructor
right without any vessel constructor and
this movie what kind is used in Pulp
revascularization ok this 3% is a movie
what kind is used in the pulp
revascularization which is of shorter
duration and make a note that this is
the most commonly asked question right
so of 0.5 percentage of boopie what kind
is of longer duration of MVA okay no
need of this but try to focus on this
and this most common last ok we're done
with this and moving ahead there okay
there is something called a speaker
value we have already discussed the pKa
values the pKa values are the maximum
okay the maximum for these two okay so
the program pros are the maximum you can
see all the pros okay
Pro stands maximum with the PK value and
you make a note about the minimum value
minimum values been joke I've been
jackin belongs to Class C biological
side classification when Japan belongs
to Class C so apart from this just make
a note most of your values will move
around seven point seven to eight point
one if you don't know the answer and
they're asking the PK value of a
particular thing apart from the highest
and the lowest most of the values we
varam 7.7 to 8.1 just making or don't
learn everything that's not smart
preparation most of your questions will
be on highest and lowest if not they
will ask a little kind if not anything
in the range of seven point seven to
eight point one I'm done with PK values
so next course with this Anatomy is very
very important because we have multiple
number of questions on this in most of
the examinations it's very simple I
don't want to make it complicated but
just go through this there's more than
sufficient solid there and almost all
the basic mcq books okay the first one
is no fiber very easy and which covers
the no fiber is end honorarium okay your
Indian medium is the one which covers
the nerve fiber okay and a bundle of
five hundred thousand no fibers now the
no fibers combined they form classically
the the one which covers the fasciculus
is the perineum okay you can see the
perineum here perineurium covering the
fascicle a right so the innermost layer
okay in the perineum which is the cover
of the fasiq layer then the most layer
is perry lemma okay don't get confused
is completely out the innermost layer is
perineum okay next one is epineurium
okay epineurium is the annular
connective tissue supporting the
fascicle a and carrying the new vessels
and the last one is AP AP neural shape
this is the pin Ural sheet and this is
the connector tissue you can see all the
this everything this here here and here
and everything you have a connector
tissue that is epineurium and the
covering outermost one is a pin you
little right so I hope you're very
clear please to make a note this is very
very important they can ask this they
can ask by giving this diagram directly
from textbook by labeling or they can
directly give it the simple definition
so these factors which affects the early
action are very very important we are
already done with PK value we learn the
highest lowest and ranges from 7.7 to
7.8
and it helps in onset of the early okay
so lower the pKa value more rapid onset
easterly don't don't go very deep lower
is the PK value if you have low PK value
the mode of onset will be very very fast
the second one is the lipid solubility
of LD okay so lipid solubility of any
effects which factor anesthetic potency
factor okay
so increase lipid solubility increases
the potency okay so I mean if the lipid
solubility is more the potency of the L
layer will be more right next the next
one is a protein binding property so
proteins if it is if it's have the
ability to bind to the protein the
duration it controls the duration so
increasing in the protein binding allows
the anaesthetic cation to be more firmly
attached to the protein located at the
receptor site thus the duration of the
action increases so it wants or it holds
for a longer duration of time whenever
it holds the availability of it will be
more and it will be for a longer
duration of time okay then the non now
as tissue diffusability it's also
depends upon the onset okay it helps non
set increasing in the diffusability
decreases the onset like if it is able
to diffuse into other tissues apart from
the nerves means it's going to go away
so the diffusability most moving away is
going to decrease the time of onset okay
next one is mass or delayed reaction so
it it helps in controlling the
anesthetic potency as well as the drug
the greater the vasodilator action
increases the blood flow to the to the
region okay there will be more blood
flow if the vasodilator action will be
more so and apart from that it helps in
whenever the drug well the main reason
to compensate this we give a
vasoconstrictor to hold it for a longer
duration of time i hope most of the
things are very interrelated i have seen
a decent number of questions on this
particular area so i have
right so next comes is the antic on
values and blood levels like one alia is
overdoses so there will be few
consequences which will be which I'm
going to deal in the second slide next
slide but making out this these values
are important so anticonvulsant blood
levels of local anesthetics so the
anticonvulsant level will be seen at
this value there is zero point five to
four and the procedures and the same
terms can be seen at four point five
this is very important whenever the
value goes and hits about seven point
five new gram per ml the tone of chronic
stress will be same okay
so please do make a note ok these are
the categories of sympathy emblematic
and mines which are categorized into
direct acting indirect acting and mixed
acting so recently there was a question
that is given in the aims exam very
simple which of the following is
indirectly Act and you need to pick the
options so please don't make a note add
to this notes do practice this there is
high chances that you can encounter the
same question so as already discussed
the overdoses or failure what is going
to happen what are the consequences so
the overdoses can be categorized into
two types that is a minimal to moderate
doses there will be some signs and some
symptoms and similar there will whenever
it hits moderate to high doses then the
complications will be more and more okay
so we'll just have a look like when when
the man it is minimal to moderate the
page talkativeness so the patient I mean
they may feel wanting sensation that
will be sweating elevated blood pressure
elevated heart rate elevated respiratory
rate failure to follow the commands
right this is important and these are
all signs and coming to the symptoms the
symptoms is restlessness nationís the
metallic taste visual disturbances
auditory disturbances loss of
consciousness incoherent everything okay
so but most important thing is moderate
to high dosages that is tonic-clonic
seizures have already discussed there
will be generalized
CNS system depression okay and there
will be
depress blood pressure I mean these are
the late complications or the
complications which are mainly concerned
with high doses of local anaesthetic
solution okay so so that's the you need
to make anyone because they can ask you
some questions okay so basing upon this
limited knowledge you can easily pick
the right answer okay so I'm just going
to move to the next part that is you can
see the bubble in the catalyst right so
they can ask you the bubble size okay
size is just one to two millimeters and
the content this is the Nitro some cash
okay nitrogen gas will be present in
this okay sometimes in the clinical
scenario you can see a condition where
the stopper the stopper can be extruded
and I mean that is basically when your
catalyst this particular catalyst is
stored inside the fridge nothing
sometimes regularly the the size should
be this one to two millimeters and
sometimes unfortunately you can identify
you can identify the presence of a
larger bubble okay
so large bubble the larger bubble may be
due to the contamination okay so
whenever you see a larger bubble it is
mandatory that you have to return the
cat rest okay should not use that
particular cat rests but I hope you
remember the auntie auntie rest like an
auntie rest solution which is used in
your operative dentistry that is sodium
right right right to person does sodium
nitrate that has been okay that they
contain is capable of releasing the
metal ions which can be related to the
incidence of edema so like to prevent
this rusting process few people they use
this and that leads to the complication
of local anesthesia so care should be
taken like before you start the
procedure when you are using cat rays
you should see the size of the bubble
because if the size of the bubble is
more than that
then definitely complete some sort of
contamination because few people they
store this local anaesthetics in
disinfectants like alcohols so whenever
you use an alcohol contaminated see this
point the local anaesthetic solution
containing alcohol produces say
uncomfortable burning sensation or
injection right so all these things has
to be taken into consideration because
they can give an application based
question on this particular area so it's
already known I think this is the to
marks question for you in the final year
right burning sensation upon injection
is mainly due to I mean it can be a
normal response to the pH of the drug
means the pH of earlier what you're
using may be the PK value has some role
and the second one of the catalyst
contains sterilizing solution like
alcohol I was discussing in the last
slide that alcohol can be used for
disinfection of these cat raisers
sometimes contaminates the ELMO
sometimes the overheated cat rages can
also cause a burning sensation or cat
raisers which contains some a supersuit
can also make a note about these four
points which are the primary reasons for
the burning sensation upon injection
okay so next one is the Food and Drug
Administration lactation categories this
is a very very important previously
asked in PG a followed by names okay and
of course their high chances that they
can repeat the same questions so
categories are the S category as
question mark estar and NS MS is very
simple and as means not safe and cushion
per clearly says that you don't pay
anything okay as is for the safety very
simple as is safe for nutrient nursing
infants and medication are usually
compatible with the breastfeeding
whereas s question mark you don't have
proper literature means you don't know
you don't have any idea whereas estar
potential for significant effects on
nursing women it's going to cause the
damage but the medication can be given
with some caution notice means not at
all safe okay so categories of pregnancy
drugs we'll be discussing in
pharmacology which is important thing
because there are many questions which
are asked on this in 2000
17 neat so there are different
categories of drugs which are to be
given in the pregnancy will discuss in
pharmacology but now we'll be focusing
more on the local anesthetics which
comes out of these categories and the
lactation categories right so most of
the local anesthetics all the local
anesthetics they come Center
B and C category and what is most
commonly used your little kind so can
Lido kind and pre low kinda comes under
B category and rest all they comes under
C category okay next one
not safe okay so in lactation time
epinephrine is not sure okay
epinephrine is not safe which is only
safest one the safest one is Lu token so
Lido kind which comes under a pregnancy
B category is the safest one okay both
for the lactation as well as for the
pregnancy category okay so please do
make a note about these points which
were very very important so Dan for now
signing off doctor's taken from team MDS
conquer the only extracting that I'm
going to cover in the part three part
three will not be a video class will be
a class which will be taken on your
respective groups okay so we will be
dealing with a few things which are
already discussed here I'm just going to
ask few questions answer them that is
the first part in the path tree and
followed by the problem-solving okay I'm
going to I'm going to explain the
problem-solving step face I hope you
remember all those things how much
amount of local anesthesia is present in
one cat race how much amount of
epinephrine is present in one cat race
how many cartridges can we give to this
particular individual who's of sixty
cases I hope you you have encountered
such questions in your ug life right
either in your vibe or in your clinical
scenario in the department's because is
the most commonly asked viable question
so such things are again most common for
your need and aims and PJ and all other
