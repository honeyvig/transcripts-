I didn't wanted to be a developer
throughout my career hence I upgraded
myself I have skilled and I wanted to
see myself in a manager role and right
now I'm into it that's why I always
believed in learning and upscaling
ourself and I did that and that became
my success Mantra after completing
training from Simply learn on PMP and
popm I have got a new job and a very
good salary hike hi my name is Mayor
Singh Chan and this is my journey I am
from MP basically but I'm staying in
Bangalore from last 25 years I have done
all my education here I've done BBM and
MBA in finance and it and I've been
working here from last 13 14 years
mostly into sap and software development
and project management uh domains so
when did I start realizing that I need
to up skill not only for the
certifications I got opportunities to go
to abroad but because of my uh education
was only the graduation I did not get
the chance I had to upgrade myself then
I did MBA and then I wanted to get into
project management I wanted to get into
senior leadership roles I have to do uh
project management uh certifications
like PMP and safe PM that I have done
already so it's always whenever you
wanted to get something you wanted to
achieve something you the realization is
always it's it's all through it's not
one day that I realized but when you
feel that I need to achieve the pursuit
starts there itself initially in my
career my brother he he always persuaded
me he motivated me to do like multiple
course learn something else uh learn the
new technology which are upcoming in the
market but later on uh when you have
experience quite handsful of experience
you have you realize yourself that you
need to learn so and so you can select
the courses which you wanted to do about
simply learn how did I know about it I
just said my friend one of my friend was
there uh he's in Canada right now he's
also into project man management he did
PMP and he's uh I was chasing him that
okay I also want to do it how did you do
let tell me he said okay I will teach
you just get the PD certificate and they
will also teach you and he had some
connections maybe he just made me
connected to Simply learn and then he
said okay do this course for some days
uh however I never thought that okay I
need to search for other institutes
whatever he said okay simply learn you
can do it from here and from then I have
done multiple courses from Simply learn
and I've have never gone to any other
Institute maybe the online uh platforms
but simpl has been my partner on
upscaling myself on S on PMP on safe PM
getting pdus or maybe I have also
introduced my friends to you know to do
multiple course from syar obviously the
course the LMS the structure is
absolutely um fantastic because uh it
will cover all the topics you need not
to go I think you know people will say
that you have to take multiple books to
complete some course you can buy you can
always refer multiple books but I feel
that if you complete only the LMS and
focus on the the content your instructor
will provide you that would be enough
it's just that you need to focus it
because uh project management is not
about learning something it's about ear
learning also because what all you have
done in your career may not be there in
the books they will teach you the
standard way recommended way and you
might not Implement as it is in your
office also so but learning whatever
they're saying it as it is and if you
focus it it is not going to be a tough
task for me the flexibility of timing
has been the best thing I would say
because my daughter was just born at
that time when I joined simp I have to
spend more time with her and me and my
wife only two people in in bangal like
all the other families they have they
don't have your parents and grandparents
there to support you with your child so
whenever I used to get time off from my
office maybe in the night I used to do
the course so simply provides your
flexibility of timing and then the
course material they have is exhaustive
they it covers everything see for
anyone's success the support of the
family cannot be overlooked it is always
there even if the family is not there
with you they are praying somewhere
maybe so the support of the family is
always indispensable I was married I had
a daughter but my wife take care of my
daughter so much and she's always there
with me I'm so blessed to have my wife
in my life she's the best ever lady lady
I would say apart from my work I like to
spend time with with my family I have
very lovely daughter and my friends also
I have really good friends in my life
and I like to to read books on
spirituality on
motivation to progress ahead as I
mentioned earlier that I always um keep
learning I'm I wanted to do PhD now
pursue PhD I have also applied for some
of the universities already so that is
my goal next because maybe after 10 15
years I feel like I need to get into
academics again that has been my passion
before to teach people so that's how if
simply Lear will help me with this this
aspirations also would be great actually
to study something to skill yourself
it's never late whenever you realize uh
you want to learn not only in terms of
uh maybe academics anything else also if
you want to do something out of the box
maybe uh Follow Your Passion it's never
late so it's always you need to grow in
your career I like my job I like my work
so I need to grow there and I need to
keep upscaling
