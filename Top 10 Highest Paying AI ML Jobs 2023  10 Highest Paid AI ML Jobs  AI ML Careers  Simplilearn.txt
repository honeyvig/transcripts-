is mentioned in the description box
below so without any further delay let's
start this video with what is artificial
intelligence artificial intelligence
refers to the development of computer
systems and software that can perform
tasks that typically require human
intelligence
these tasks include reasoning problem
solving learning from experience
understanding natural language
recognizing patterns and making
decisions AI aims to create machines or
softwares that can mimic human cognitive
functions enabling them to perform tasks
with worrying level of complexity AI is
surely one of the most sought-after
Industries for professionals looking for
a promising career and a lucrative
salary so let's talk about the top five
AI jobs with the highest salaries at
number five we have a computer vision
engineer a computer vision engineer is a
programmer skilled in creating software
using visual input sensors and
algorithms these systems can interpret
their environment as seen in
self-driving cars and facial recognition
computer vision Engineers uses languages
like C++ and python they work on tasks
like object detection image segmentation
facial and gesture recognition and scene
comprehension consequently the
compensation packages for computer
vision Engineers have become notably
attractive according to glaso the
average salary of a computer vision
engineer is
$155,000 in the United States and in
India it's rupees 8 lakh perom serving
as a significant incentive for
individuals venturing into this domain
at number four we have software
Engineers software Engineers handle
tasks from design to deployment but it's
rare to find experts in All Phases they
usually specializes in specific areas
this specialization applies to AI
software Engineers too they work on
various applications including machine
learning inference learning NLP and
intrusion detection covering different
aspects of AI development consequently
the compensation packages for software
Engineers have become notably attractive
according to glaso the average salary of
a software engineer is
$140,000 in the United States and in
India it's rupees 9 lakh perom serving
as a significant incentive for
individuals venturing into this domain
moving on to number three we have
machine learning Engineers a machine
learning engineer creates and deploys
training algorithms and models which is
the most demanding part of machine
learning most machine learning Engineers
hold Advanced degrees in computer
science mathematics or statistics due to
the need for advanced math skills many
also pursue specialized master's degrees
or certifications in machine learning
deep learning or neural networks
consequently the compensation packages
for ML Engineers as well is notably
attractive according to glasso the
average salary of a machine learning
engineer is
$150,000 in the United States and in
India it goes up to 11 lakh rupees perom
with additional cash benefits at number
two we have an AI research scientist AI
research scientists often computer
scientists focuses on innovating AI
algorithms and models their duties
include creating and evaluating new AI
models collaborating in research
publishing papers and presenting at
conferences while programming is a part
of their work it's just a portion unlike
the tech industry's openness to
self-taught programmers AI research
scientists need strong backgrounds in
computer science mathematics and
statistics consequently the compensation
packages for AI research scientists have
become notably attractive according to
glaso the average salary of an AI
research scientist is
$125,000 in the United States and rupes
21 lakhs perom in India with additional
cash benefits and finally at number one
we have an AI product manager an AI
product manager is much like other
program managers they oversee teams for
AI product development handling
schedules and Milestones to do this
effectively they need to understand AI
components like hardware and programming
languages which helps them support their
teams creating AI apps differs from web
applications in structure and
development processes consequently the
compensation is the highest for AI
product managers in 2024 according to
glaso the average salary of an AI
product manager is
$190,000 in the United States and in
India it goes around 26 lakh rupees
perom with additional cash compensations
so these are the top five job roles you
should consider entering in
2024 so let's go through the reasons why
AI individuals are are paid so much the
first reason is surging demand AI is in
high demand across Industries due to its
