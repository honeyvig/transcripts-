hello everyone i am mank and welcome to
simply learn today we will take you
through the hands-on lab demo of how you
can create a speech to text or speech
recognition system using python
before we start i hope this screen is
clearly visible and the audio is fine if
yes please type in yes if there are any
issues do let us know in the chat
section so that we can resolve them
i am repeating again before we start i
hope the screen is clearly visible and
the audio is fine if yes please type in
yes if there are any issues do let us
know in the chat section so that we can
resolve them
let's wait for some more minutes to let
other people join
yeah until then let me tell you guys

it i think we can get started
so in today's session we will go through
what is a speech recognition system
moving forward we will see how speech
recognition system works after that we
will create a speech recognition system
using python
we will perform different function and
create speech recognition system using
different python libraries before we
move on to the programming part let's
discuss what is a specific cognition
system first and proceed further for the
same
what is space recognition system
a program capacity to convert spoken
language into written language is known
as a speech recognition system also
known as automatic series recognition
computer voice recognition or speech to
text despite being sometimes confused
with voice recognition
speech recognition focus on converting
speech form a verbal to a text format
whereas voice recognition only aims to
distinguish the voice of a certain
person
voice and speech recognition are two
distinct technologies and they shouldn't
be confused
to recognize word in spoken language
speech recognition is used voice
recognition uses biometrical
technologies to recognize a specific
person by their voice
so after knowing what is speech
recognition system let's move forward
and see how does his recognition system
work
pc cognition in python works with
algorithm that performs linguistic and
acoustic modeling acoustic modeling is
used to recognize phonetics in our
speech to get the most significant part
of speech as words and sentences
specific cognition start by taking the
sound energy produced by the person
speaking and converting it into the
electrical energy
with the help of microphone
it then converts the electrical energy
from analog to digital and finally to
the text
it breaks the audio data down into
sounds and it analyze the sound using
algorithm to find the most probable word
that fits that audio
all of this is done using natural
language processing nlp and neural
networks
hidden markov models can be used to find
temporal patterns in speech and improve
accuracy so here is one question for you
guys i will give you one minute for this
you can comment or you can give your
answer in the chat section so i can see
if the answers given by you are right or
wrong
i'm repeating again so here is one
question for you guys
i will give you exactly one minute for
this you can comment or you can give
answer in the chat section so i can see
if the answers given by you are right or
wrong
so the question is
which of the following is the correct
extension for the python file
i'm repeating again which of the
following is the correct extension of
the python file
option a dot python
option b dot pl
option c dot p y and option d dot p
so let us know your answer in the
comment section below
so i am starting a timer of one minute
just type your answer in the comment
section or in the chat section do let me
know your answers please
i currently ask that everyone take part
in this to make this live session
exciting
so i am starting the timer
you can comment or you can give your
answer in the chat section so i can see
the answers given by you are right or
wrong
so the question is which of the
following is the correct extension of
the python file
37 seconds remaining
option a dot python option b dot pl
option c dot py option d dot p
let us know your answer in the comment
section below
i can't ask that everyone take part in
this to make the live session exciting
you have 15 seconds remaining
10 seconds more
which of the following is the correct
extension of the python file
3
2
one
after that allotted time has passed
those who provided the correct or
response will receive a response and
those who provided the incorrect
response will receive one
okay so now let's move to our
programming part to create
a speech recognition system using python
so first we will open a command prompt
to write a command to open jupyter
notebook so here we will write jupyter
notebook
press enter
so this is the landing page of jupiter
notebook and here you can select new
python file
so this is how the jupiter notebook ui
looks like so at first we will import
some major libraries of python which
will help us in creating space
recognition system
so here we will write
first let me remain rename this
speech
recog
so first i will import import
each
underscore
recognition
and second import
pytts
x
3
presenter
so the incredibly attention i repeat the
incredibly extensible speech recognition
library serves as a wrapper for a number
of well-known speech apis
the speech recognition library includes
default api key for one of these
the google web speech api hard coded
that implies that you can start moving
without needing to register for a
service
and python project would benefit greatly
from using the speech recognition
package due to its virtuality and
usability
and then pytts x3 a python text to
speech conversion library is called
pytts x3
it is compatible with python 2 and
python 3 and work offline unlike
competing libraries to obtain a
reference to a pytts x3 engine instance
an application calls the pytts x3 in it
it is very user friendly program that
turns type text into speech
so moving forward let's write code for
actual speech recognition system
so here i will write
sr
equals to speech
underscore
here i will write with
speech
underscore
recognition
dot
microphone
source
2
then colon
yeah
here
i will write print
right here okay silence
please
then i will write here sr
dot adjust
underscore for
underscore
ambient
underscore noise
then
source
2
comma duration
equals to 2
okay
then enter
then i will print something like
peek
now
please
something like that
then i will write here audio
audio 2
equals to sr
dot
listen
source
2
and here i will write for text
equals to
sr
dot
recognize
okay
underscore
google
audio
two
then here i have to print in small
letters
in lowercase so i will write here text
equals to text
dot lower
just
then here i will write
print
it
you say
plus
text
everything look great
so a recognizer is a machine ability to
listen to spoken words and identify them
you can then use a speech recognition in
python to convert the spoken words into
text
make a query or give a reply you can
even program some devices to respond to
these spoken words
like every time the recognized speech
from mic function is invoked the
recognizer is calibrated for changing
noise condition using the edges for
ambient noise this one for ambient noise
the backlog parameter of the listen
function allow a quiz size to be
specified it will listen to what we are
speaking or saying
this recognize google
a function on the recognizer class
which you have now developed will be
used to query the google web speech api
and convert spoken words into text
recognize google needs the argument
audio data in order to function properly
otherwise it will fail
python built in function lower is mostly
used to handle strings
the lower method converts each capital
character in the provided string to
lowercase before returning the lowercase
string it accept no arguments it
returned to the original text if the
supplied string has no capital letters
now let's check whether it's working or
not so i will run it yeah
run all
hello how are you doing
you can see hello how are you doing
printed
so let me try another one
subscribe to simply learn youtube
channel and press that bell icon to
never miss any update from simply learn
so here you can see subscribe to simplyn
youtube channel and press that bell icon
to never miss any update from simply
learn is printed
so speech to text is working fine
so i hope you guys understand till here
if you have any questions or any queries
regarding any code or you have any
questions just put as in comments our
team will shortly provide you with the
correct solution
now moving forward what if we want that
system will write what we are saying and
speak that to
this will be printed and
now moving forward what if you want that
system will write what we are saying and
speak that too
so for that we will write a small line
of code
so first we will do
we will create one
here
like we will insert cell below we will
write a function here so df f
speak now
command
colon
then voice
equals to
p y t t s x 3
dot init
okay
then voice dot say
command
and voice
dot run
and
wait
yeah
so what we will do here
we will write
like
speak
now
then
so this voice is nothing just a variable
to text to speech and in it pytt x3
engine has started obtains a pointer to
an instance of an engine that will
utilize the specified driver
if another engine stand is already using
the given driver the other engine stance
is returned if not a new engine is built
a speed now is a function in which
using get function i am getting the
values of the text this one i will get
now let's run this sort of code and
let's see if it is working or not so i
will
run
hello how are you all
peak now is not different okay
speak now okay and small
okay my bad run this again
hello how are you all
hello how are you all
i hope you can hear properly so let me
run this again for another demo example
subscribe to simplyland youtube channel
and press that bell icon to never miss
any update from simplylearn
subscribe to simple and youtube channel
and press the bell icon to never miss
any updates from simplylearn
yeah so i hope you guys understand till
here if you have any question or any
queries regarding any code
or you have any question related to
python just put as in comments our team
will shortly provide you with the
correct solution
okay okay moving forward
so at last let's create speech
recognition system from which we can
open our websites and all
like youtube like facebook like simply
learn
anything
so we will open
open new file for this i will create the
separate one
and i will write speech
to web
websites
okay
speech to web
so here i will import import
speech
underscore
recognition
and
import
pytts x3
then
one major library import
web browser
okay then i will run it
yeah
i hope you already know these two first
two libraries so this is third library
is used for
web browser is the file source code the
web browser modules offers a high level
user interface that enables user to view
web-based content
in most cases executing the open
function from this module
will result in the desired outcome
so moving forward let me write code for
it
so i will write code first then i will
explain you linewise
so i will write
if
underscore underscore
name
then again to underscore equals to
equals to
underscore main then again underscore
then colon
yeah then you have to give a path like
for your browser you can use edge you
can use google chrome
anything firefox anything
so here i will give path path equals to
then
c drive
i have my path
already
program
files
and
x
86
microsoft
and
edge then
okay then
application
and msh
dot e x e
you have to write at the end this
percentage s
don't forget to write this
okay so path is set so let me create sr
equals to
speech
recognition
dot
recognizer
same as previous one
and i will write with speech
underscore
recognition
dot
microphone
as source
and sr dot adjust
or
bend
noise
then source
now everything seems good
let me write print
but we have wrote there
like
speak
now please so here i will write
please
hey
something
to open
okay
i'll write audio equals to
sr dot listen
listen
that source
and i will print
like what you said
so it will hear
hearing
and i will here i try and accept
then try
so here i will write destination
equals to sr
dot recognize
let's go google
then audio
print
you
asked
to open
right here plus
destination
okay
so then
web
browser
browser
dot
get
that path
then open
that destination
destination
okay
so here i will write that accept
exception
caption
as
you can write e
then
print
if there will be error
error
still
e
okay
so our recognizer is a machine ability
to listen to spoken words and identify
them you can use speech recognition in
python to convert the spoken word into
text
you can even program some devices to
respond to these spoken words
every time the recognized speech from
mic function is invoked the recognizer
is calibrated for changing noise
condition using the adjust ambient noise
method
a socket is all ready to receive
connection after calling the listen
function
prior to performing the accept method on
the server socket the listen method
should be called the backlog parameter
of the listen function allow our cue
size to be specified it will listen to
what we are speaking or saying
the recognized google function on the
recognizer class which you have now
developed will be used to query the
google web speech api and will convert
spoken words into text
recognize google needs the argument
audio data in order to function properly
otherwise it will fail
okay
so okay so let's try this it's working
or not
let me run this
okay invalid syntax perhaps you forgot a
comma
okay let me see
that print error
inc it should be yeah
okay let me check this
let me run this again
valid syntax perhaps you forget a comma
hey
try to run this again
two
okay
let me remove this i guess it will work
fine
still
didn't put okay okay no issues
so here i will write
again
accept
exception
e
and
errors
tr okay i forgot to write plus okay okay
e
yeah now it will work fine
