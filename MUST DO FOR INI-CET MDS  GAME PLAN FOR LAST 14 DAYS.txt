very good morning one and all
now i'm going to give a brief idea of
what you need to do
for the upcoming 14 days for your d-day
of inict
that is on november 20th
so first of all taking the things or
subjects you have done in module 3 into
consideration
okay i will be focusing on
your splitting your days and using them
in the right way before you give the
exam
and assuming these 14 days
you're working minimum 15 hours
per day and i hope coming to the
modules and the special exams into
consideration
for the need okay so i hope most of you
are already done
with two to three mock exams of inic 80
so please do allocate the leftover time
like
you're done with mach 1 mark 2
it's already said mach3 is going to be
the november ames
and mach 4 which is going to be the june
ames right
so you'll have one more mock exam that
is going to be the mock file
so this is a rough idea of your mocks so
keep some time for mocks
along with once i am done with the mock
exams i will provide you the special
exams
okay special exams are going to be one
two three four and five special exams so
please do
keep some time for this to finish this
exam
followed by to read the synopsis
associated with this exam
so apart from that i'll be uploading
last minute revision part exclusively
friends
until now what whatever 25
the the pdf files that you have on the
smart nodes on the website are
common for both aims as well as sorry
common for both ini cd as well as for
the neet
but from now from today i'm going to
upload few more pdfs
which are exclusively from ames okay
i mean the topics that are frequently
asked in the ames
or a nact and the textbooks
and the pages in which most of the
questions of inicit
and aims are moving so such things will
be uploaded on the website and the
notification will be dropped on the
group and
make sure you try to finish those pages
and apart from that please try to attend
the discussion
you will have some hardly 30 to 45
minutes of discussion
which is going to take one hour to read
so don't write the discussion part in
this peak time
my suggestion is to read it on the group
itself make sure you read it on the
group itself
right so your dividing the day is more
important make sure you split the day
into multiple halves a minimum five
halves so for example 15 hours
you need to split into three three three
three right so in this three hours
i want you to spend
one and half hour for power play books
revision and one and half hour
for your group stuff revision that is
that is maybe your rapid
last minute revision pdfs or
other group stuff one and half hour is
going to be sufficient every day
and similarly one end of our power play
books revision
and i i mean like every corner of pp
book is very very important
right so that you need to do
okay so one end of one and up so you are
left over with
12 hours so in this 12 hours
you divide your day accordingly
so that already i hope most of you are
done with
one two three so left or with two mock
examinations
and five special examinations special
examinations each of
hundred marks are not going to eat much
of your time
whereas 200 marks examinations are going
to take some time
to finish them so please do allocate
these
five plus two seven examinations
properly in this 14 days
accordingly if you are not done with the
one two three marks also please do
allocate the time for them
in this 12 hours every day right
so rest of the time should be allocated
as per your request
like as per your consent which subject
you are weak at which subject you are
good at
you need to check and you need to focus
on
so like for example if you ask me i am
not asking to
fade out or neglect any other subject
but i am stressing the
few subjects which are very very
important
because of course aims aims uh
like if it's in ict or if it's neat
luckily we have blueprint for the neat
okay
blueprint for we have a blueprint for
the neet and
in most of the scenarios in ninety
percent of the situations
uh by analyzing the question papers or
by talking with the students we came to
a conclusion that they are following it
but there is no blueprint for aims okay
there is no blueprint for aims
all the analysis we regularly give but
there is no blueprint frames
but i am going to stress out few
important
subjects or corners where the questions
are moving a bit
such thing is one is anatomy
so anatomy cannot be neglected
okay so good thing is anatomy is done
for you
in the recent module so i hope most of
you are good at
so what you have to focus in anatomy is
mostly embryology
you have many questions given in the
examinations on embryology
okay that moves around your head and
neck that moves around the development
of tempo mandalore joint cleft lift
cleft palate
maxillary process all these how how
these are very simple questions
and the second one is exceptions
most of your questions will be tagged in
the anatomy
or in the in the ina cd like probably
you'll get to know on
the 20th you have to know everything
about every statement
okay because the questions are all of
the following are true except
which of the following is a false
statement so exceptions are very very
important in
anatomy all the modules of this
are supplied by one except so in anatomy
you have
exceptions no supply or any other supply
you have exceptions
so questions are moving around those
exceptions and
and anatomy questions are regularly most
commonly asked questions and it is very
easy to handle and it's a scoring area
the next jumping to the next important
subject
in your first year is biochemistry
even biochemistry questions are direct
questions
because they cannot ask an application
based question or a new question
in anatomy or a biochemistry which are
which in which the modifications or
advancements are very little
to our concern okay so please do make a
note
uh your biochemistry where the questions
are being
asked make a note make a note this this
this suggestions or this schedule is
exclusively for the people
who are aiming for inic who are
seriously preparing for inec
and make sure make sure don't revise
the content uh
which which everyone revises okay so
biochemistry i hope most of you
in the first round when you're doing
biochemistry you have done fibia
right you have done phobia and i hope
you have done the same in the second
round
and i want you to revise the same in in
this limited time
i am not asking you to do enter phibio
part but
i hope you have marked few areas few
tables okay
of course most of the content related to
biochemistry is properly covered in your
pp books also in the form of tables
uh all the all the memory based stuff so
make sure you do whatever the content
which you have
done in the first round very specific
i'm very specific even if it is anatomy
i want you to do the content or the pdfs
what are being shared on the group
uh i mean like the shade on the group or
what are being present in the website in
the smart video session
so please do the content okay so anatomy
and coming to the next important subject
okay you can fade physiology a bit
questions are being asked in physiology
but they're bitter tricky so
they may not hurt your computation job
so you can fade physiology but i'm
asking
not to remove your physiology entirely
but
do normal revision of physiology within
your limitations whatever the group
stuff has done whatever
the videos that you are accessible to or
you do that
but don't do exclusively hard hardcore
preparation on
the physio okay so the next one is the
dental materials
so dental materials is also direct okay
questions are being directly
taken from phillips okay so it's very
difficult to read phillips but it's easy
to read your pp books and the content
which is accessible to you so once
just have a random look over the
numericals and everything okay because
one or two numericals are going to
change
your game plan completely okay so this
is the main concept about your
first year subjects and the next moves
to the
uh dental anatomy and dental histologist
okay
so dental anatomy dental histology yeah
luckily god's grace
this is also done in the recent module
for you and make sure
you give some limited time but make sure
you revise more
d a when compared to d h because
d a is more of memory based and of
course they ask
all the numbers and anything they can
ask which can be application based
question also
so this is a this is a recently done
topic so
give some limited or proper time for
revision of
dn and next jumping to the next subject
that is pharmacology
pharmacology is one subject which is
very very
very important in ames
either in scoring wise as well as in
in making your rank better okay so
whatever things we have done
related to pharmacology whether it is
spurs
or whether it is the group stuff or
whether it's a powerful book content
okay so make sure you give at most
important importance and try to cover it
if you feel if it is tricky
keep everyday half an hour pharmacology
or half an hour to 45 minutes
pharmacology
from today because this is a subject
which has a decent waiters
the paper setters are really giving
questions on this and it has to be done
at your best
so coming next to the pharmacology uh
the next thing you have to take
into consideration the microbiology
microbiology has a decent weightage
questions are moving around microbiology
so please allocate some time and make
sure
you you try your best to cover this
microbiology
there is no specifications like you need
to be very focused on this
the questions are generalized of course
the questions are on the most common
things which we have discussed
so you just please do the proper
revision
the next comes is general path
make sure uh apart from i mean general
path is
a very very limited subject in a dental
student point of view
okay most of you are well familiar with
the
necrosis inflammations calcifications
apoptosis
oh most of you are familiar but the main
concept of
you should be when you are talking about
these both like
micro and pathology is immunology
okay immunology cells
the markers okay when you're talking
about the malignancies
tumor markers everything these are all
completely solidly memory
based which has to be revised end times
okay
what are the different markers and again
coming to the
next chapter in general path that is
genetics genetics also you have
lots of numbers that you have to make
you own so it's completely
memory based i hope most of you can
handle this
this part that is the necrosis and
inflammation immunology
hemodynamics and everything can be
handled at your best but
i feel the trickiest aspect is going to
be the immunology
and the numbers which move the memory
based stuff which move around immunology
and genetics
so go back do the consent stuff
okay make sure you you you're good at
good with the subject
okay so this is how you need to cover
micro gp and the pharmacology
so next jumping to the next part
that is your oral path oral medicine
and radiology so
these three subjects combined with
the general medicine is the
most important
combination for aims
most of your questions in the
examination hall directly indirectly
moves around this combination
of course if you if you observe the last
three sessions or rounds of
inaced medicine is a bit neglected
neglected means it's being combined in
oral medicine or it's being combined in
general
path or it's being combined in
physiology but i want you to give
up most important covering each and
every corner what has been discussed
what
what is going in your preparation phase
on the group
okay make sure you try to give your best
because this combination is important
and this combination is very easy to
score
because the depth of the subject is
known by the dentist
so it's very easy to score this
combination if you maintain high
accuracy in this combination
it's going to be very very useful for
you to crack the examination
the next comes is general surgery so
keep your limitations
uh in the in the preservation don't give
much of your time
for general surgery for now it's
important very important for need
need but the questions were a bit less
from general surgery
in concern with your iron icd okay
make sure you give a limited time okay i
don't want you to quit general surgery
but keep a limited time for general
surgery so that's about the
subjects up to the third year so coming
to the final year subjects
of course i am covered with oral
medicine and radiology
so the final year subjects the first one
i want to talk about is perio
peria is a very very important
important subject it's a five star
subject among the clinical subjects
where the questions are being picked
directly from kharansa it's difficult to
do currency at this peak time
but it's easy to do pp books which was
prepared from karan's
as a reference so i want you guys to go
back finish the pb books part
and finish the discussion part because
most of the discussion content
in the first round and the second round
were taken directly from karanza so
do some do some work like whatever the
subject you have
please do given utmost importance to
this subject of course
luckily the subject was covered in the
group on
in the recent recent 15 days back so
i hope you're good at this the next
comes
is ortho
in combination with p dot
most of your diagram based questions
are being picked from this particular
area
even questions on dental materials
related to orthodontics
are being asked okay and i want you to
work on that particular area also which
is which is
most often neglected by most of the
students dental materials
of ortho okay
i hope you have done this in round one
uh when you when we are dealing with the
dental materials make sure you try to
finish this
don't don't miss that because questions
are being pulled from
dental material related stuff of
orthodontics and peter and everything
you can just go back and have a decent
revision
uh of your like pedo
most of you have done muthu and for
ortho you have done
sharon okay so most of you have done
these books so please go back
okay and and i mean like if you have
done go back and
just have a glance that's going to help
you a lot
okay when when it went to the
competition it's a tough question coming
it's going to help you a lot so cue good
importance to these
orthopedics so once we are done with
this
we'll jump into the next part so endor
is
more important when compared with the
cons if it is a comparison
ender is more important most of the
questions are being picked from endo
linda is one of the important subject
for ini cet
so please do finish the stuff in pp
books
and everywhere like whatever you have
done related to ender
so please do have a proper glance
because ender was done in module one
cons was done in module one orthopedic
is done in module one so
there is a little lap of two months
whereas your period is being done
in module 3 so there is no lap so give
more importance to these
subjects so once i'm done i'm just
jumping to the prosthetics
so prosthetics plus implants implants is
a very very
important content so i want everyone to
do implants from pb books everyone to do
the
video content that is present on the
on the website related to the implants
okay so please do some
good work on implants the dental
materials or the implants perio part of
implants surgical part of implants
prosthetic blood of implants all the
different bone densities their values
the textures their examples
the classifications anatomical landmarks
and their considerations
distance indications contraindications
infections everything complications
everything related to the implants
implants is not most important thing
and coming to the prosthetic part i want
you to go
because this is what this is done in
module one two months back
so i want you to give more time for
prosthetics
uh either to recap your fpd rpd or rcd
make sure you give up most important to
the diagram based stuff also
your landmarks anatomical landmarks in
the case of complete denture
and coming to the maxillary and
mandibular major connectors
diagrams the clasps and their diagrams
and the content indications
contraindications
advantages disadvantages your finish
lines
where they are given what are the
advantages what are the disadvantages
all all sort of things like everything
has to be done from prosthetics
and implants part because you have done
this subject two months back
that's the reason why i'm stressing it
long
so see keep some uh good time allocate
some good time for this
okay so we are done with that and we are
jumping to oral surgery
of course oral surgery is recently done
but it's one of the
most important subject and of course in
oral surgery
uh the most sub important topics are
is very very important when compared to
lea hopefully i i hope most of you can
handle earlier based questions
but i want you to have a depth oriented
uh stuff related to general anesthesia
okay the next is the medical emergencies
medical emergencies of course i'll be
taking few more uh
discussions related to the medical
emergencies from medical emergencies
malmet the questions are being
picked from these these areas okay so we
will have some
discussions and of course you have major
video content which is prepared for
medical emergencies of malamate
individual medical emergencies videos
are available in your smart videos part
i think those
these videos are present in your channel
medicine so please do go back
and check they are going to help you for
sure they are going to help you a lot
the next important sub topic that most
of the people neglect is factures
and the treatment plan and of course
your orthognathic surgeries all the
recent advances in
oral surgery are very very important
okay your scopes
your incubations very important is
incubations
different types of incubations when they
are given what are the advantages what
are the complications and everything
so oral surgery is is is an important
area
the next coming to is the community
medicine plus community dentistry
uh not a heavy heavy subject but of
course luckily it was done recently for
you
in the module 3 and module 2 so
what you need to focus on concert things
i i hope like most of you can handle
the the bio statistics part uh
some some basic numericals not a depth
oriented by bio
biostatistics even aims are picking one
one hard odd number odd question from
biostatistics which no one can answer
so i don't want you to go to depth into
bio biostatistics part but whatever
epidemiology and biostatistics
you can do some concepts related to the
tests of chai square or
t-test paid and paid
different types of studies i hope you
can handle them
if you want you can just go back just
have a glance like which type of
test is used which type of study is used
just have a
glance i i hope most of you can handle
that the few memory based content in the
biochemistry uh
give half an hour or 45 minutes to
finish that make sure you are strong in
handling
that basics questions on your normal
curves your sensitivities your
specificities formula positive
prediction negative prediction values
so all these values your alpha alpha
errors beta address
all this just have a have a glance your
pp books
are more than sufficient because they
were properly prepared
giving some examples that's more than
sufficient and rest of you can
you can sort out in the mock
examinations during the practice or in
the special examinations
so that's about the community dentistry
please do go through the
indices okay uh which were discussed on
the group or
please do open your shopping page and
just have it glance over the indices
your biostatistics part is
very important your epidemiology is very
important your wh
themes your school health programs
and few more things will be shared on
the group and all these are very very
important contents which
you should not regret last but not least
is
just have a glance of foreign i don't
want you to
go very deep into forensic medicine
there is no need of going very deep into
medicine part
but foreign is important that picking
one or two questions from this
particular area
and your power play books and the videos
that are available on the website are
more than sufficient whatever content we
have discussed
is more than sufficient to crack these
one or two basic questions which are
going to
prepare the competition like uh the the
conclusion of this
is very simple so always make a note
like of course when you when you saw the
recent question paper you feel like
oh i don't know 30 or 40 questions in
this very new to me very new or
extraordinary
now the computation will always be in
the known questions
so the two two parts of questions known
and
unknown okay so no
and unknown most like most of the exams
80 to 85 percentage of questions are
known 20 to 25 percentage of questions
are
unknown unknown questions means tough
questions
known questions means can be tough or
easy but in a known topic
for example if a question being asked on
a dry socket
that's a known question the dry socket
question can be easy or tough
basing upon the options or the
difficulty index of the question so it
can be
easy or hard okay whereas the unknown
question
unknown question is going to be hard for
sure
so if you if you have a good preparation
in the last
few few months or anything
the number of unknown questions will
decrease
but as of now in the last 14 days you
cannot do anything for these unknown
questions
luckily if you are being exposed to the
concept in in a mock exam or in a
special exam
okay that's very luck and that's a god
god's grace
okay that's a broad case and like luck
factor but
you cannot do anything very specific to
drop the number of unknown questions
but what you can do you can do in this
14 days
for your aims or your 40 days for your
need
what better you can do is you can
increase the
accuracy in known questions
so after talking with most of the people
who
topped the country or who topped the
state
okay from the mds conquer
family so this is a conclusion that
increasing in accuracy of known
questions
is very very important rather than
cracking an unknown question
okay so the conclusion of this story is
very simple
that revision is more important
than learning new things in this last
one month
so you hardly have one month 30 to 40
days for your need
and hardly 10 to 14 days for your aims
so revision is more important
so similarly in this way allocate yours
80 days of time to revision
and 20 percentage of your time
to learn new things i don't want you to
miss the new things also because if it
is a medical student based
need or aims preparation that's a
different story because they prepare for
a long time they start their preparation
in
mbbs third year fourth year internship
post intern post post intern so they
have a lengthy preparation so most of
the mentors of
medical students they they just conclude
that don't do anything very new
focus on revision entirely but i feel
like most of us
we start preparation in internship okay
i have seen very rarely
student doing or starting their
preparation in a final year very rare
less than less than 0.5 percentage of
cases
so i don't want you to follow the game
plan of a medical
medical back or with a medical
background or of course few mentors they
say
even even i have seen few mentors
they don't suggest to read anything new
but
i i don't want okay you read new things
but make sure it should be around like
20 25
this means one fourth of the time should
be given to the
uh new things and three fourth of the
time more than three fourth of the time
should be given to the revision of known
things
okay done for now signing off dr
srikanth from team mds conquer
the only suggestion i always say is
let's work hard
uh need to make some betterment in the
life
so this is what we are working for we
are working so long
uh keeping this covered 9 and 10 into
consideration
so lots of things are going around the
minds lots of calls lots of issues
personal issues professional issues
medical medical
illness mental illness so
covet 19 in this preparation phase has
not given four or five options
it has given n number of options but
we are we are still positive i know most
of you are very positive
it's very good to see a student calling
talking sharing their personal issues
health issues but at the last they're
very positive that
we have to work hard right so so kovit
has given so many bad uh
experiences for us but still we are
doing our best right so
covet has many options but the exam has
only four options
and i hope four options can be easy when
compared with the options that are given
by the covert so
the revenge should be planned for this
19.
not 2019
the revenge should be planned for kobet
19 and the year 2020
should end up with something good in the
last phase
that is on november 20 that is on
december 16
and that is on december 31st and i hope
you have already marked these dates like
right so these dates are going to change
your life
change the fate of two zero two zero
hopefully we'll have best two zero two
one
love you all signing off dr srika from
