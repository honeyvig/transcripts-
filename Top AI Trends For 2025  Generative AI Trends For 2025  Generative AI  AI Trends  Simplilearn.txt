artificial intelligence is almost
certain to remain the most discussed
technology in 2025 influencing
everything from boardrooms and
classrooms to hospitals and homes it
will continue to become more deeply
integrated into our daily lives as AI
presence grows so does the need to
address the ethical concern related to
its impact on the human and Society many
critical questions remain unanswered how
will AI affect employment will it take
over human creativity and what are the
Privacy implications of the increasing
need to collect personal data to fuel AI
algorithms in the digital age in 2025 we
might begin finding answer to some of
these questions we will also likely see
amazing breakthroughs that would have
seemed impossible just a few year ago so
here is the list of what I think will be
the most important topics and discussion
about Ai and Automation in the next year
so hi I am mayank welcome to this video
on the top 10 AI trends for 2025 so in
this video we will talk about AI Trends
and automation for 2025 so without any
further Ado let's get started so number
one is responsible AI in 2025 there will
be a growing emphasis on developing AI
in the way that are ethical secure
transparent reliable and respectful of
intellectual property some of this will
be driven by new laws but there is also
an increasing awareness of the risk of
using AI irresponsibility issues like AI
bias and false information are now
widely recognized and reducing these
risk requires effort businesses that
ignore these concern in 20125 could face
negative press regulatory scrutiny and
customer dissatisfaction number second
next gen Voice Assistant AI Voice
Assistant like Ci and Alexa have been
part of our lives for a while but there
are conversational abilities have been
limited this year open AI introduced a
more advanced voice mode for charity
capable of holding humanlike
conversation Google is also integrating
its Gemini chatboard into mobile devices
replacing the outdated hey Google
feature by 2025 we can expect these
improvements to be available in more
devices enabling more natural voice
interaction number third we have
generative video imagine typing out a
movie idea or at least a short video and
watching it comes to life think of it as
share chity for videos open AI has
already shown a glimpse of this with its
Sora model and by 2025 we could see the
technology becoming more accessible
while we won't be making Hollywood level
films just yet this gives an exciting
preview of where generative AI could be
headed number fourth we have augmented
working this year almost every major
software tool quickly added generative
AI features as no one wanted to fall
behind in 2025 I expect more thoughtful
approaches to how humans and AI can work
together to enhance our technical skills
while giving us more time to focus on
creative and social task that machines
still can't handle instead of just
adding chat Bots everywhere smart
businesses will start using AI in ways
that create real value the next we have
realtime automated decision making as
businesses better understand the
Strategic use of AI those with more
developed AI strategies will move toward
automating entire business processes
this will likely happen in areas like
Logistics customer service and marketing
where algorithm will make decisions such
as managing inventory or responding to
customer inquiries with minimal human
involvement this will lead to faster
reaction to changes in customer Behavior
or Market condition and decreased
efficiency so before jumping to sixth
Point here is Quick Info for you dive
into the feature of AI with the
generative Ai and machine learning
course in collaboration with e ICT
Academy I guti learn tools like CH gbt
open AI hugging face Python and more
join master classes led by iatg faculty
engage in Hands-On project and earn
executive alumni status this generative
Ai and machine learning course enriches
your career Journey with comprehensive
coverage of machine learning deep
learning NLP generative AI reinforcement
learning computer vision and more
combining Theory with Hands-On project
it's offer live virtual session projects
with integrative labs and master classes
by I go faculty find the coting from the
description box below and the pin
command and number six we have
predictive AI analytics so predictive AI
analytics will become even more powerful
and accurate in 2025 it uses machine
learning to examine large amounts of
data and predict future RS businesses
will use it to forecast customer
Behavior Market shift and potential risk
in healthcare it can help predict
diseases outbreaks or patient outcomes
while retailers will optimize inventory
by forecasting Demand by 2025 more will
adopt predictive AI leading to quicker
more precise and data driven decisions
this technology will be key for staying
competitive in an increasingly Digital
World number seven we have autonomous AI
agents today's AI tool generally perform
simple task like generating text or
analyzing data to make prediction
however AI agents can carry out multiple
tasks and adjust based on the results
without needing precise instruction this
could be a step toward Journal AI that
can handle a wide range of ask however
this also brings up the question about
the need for oversight and
accountability next we have virtual
agents virtual agents are AI system
designed to mimic human conversation
helping user with tasks like answering
questions or managing schedules example
include CI and Alexa which are becoming
more advanced able to understand context
and emotion better by 2025 virtual
agents will be more personalized and
easier to use changing industry like
customer service and Healthcare and even
more these agents will make everyday
interaction quicker and more efficient
the next we have ai in cyber security
and defense as cyber attacks become more
frequent and sophisticated in 2025 AI
will be essential for detecting breaches
spotting unusual activity and automating
system to handle threats before they
cause damage AI will also help combat
fishing and social engineering attacks
by simulating these threats and teaching
users how to avoid them last we have
sustainable AI so there are two aspect
of sustainable AI first as cloudbased
system consume more massive amounts of
power there will be a push to shift data
center to renewable energy sources
second AI can help other Industries
becoming more sustainable by for example
reducing water and pesticide use in
agriculture or managing traffic to cut
down on vehicle emission so in 2025 AI
will further establish itself as a key
tool for environment prodection in
conclusion AI Technologies in 20 25 are
expected to bring continuous changes
reshipping Industries and daily life in
the coming years AI will be smoothly
integrated into everyday task from
generative AI boosting creativity to
autonomous vehicle transforming
Transportation AI will become a natural
part of daily routines so with this we
