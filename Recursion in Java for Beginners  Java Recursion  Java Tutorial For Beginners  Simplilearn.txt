foreign
and let's get started with today's topic
which is about recursion in Java so
let's first understand what do we mean
by recursion and then we will look at
the details of the class which you are
seeing on your screen so recursion is
the phenomena of an a method calling
itself so so we we have the scenarios
where we call a particular method or an
object right but what if you have a
scenario where a method wants to call
itself now you might be wondering why a
method would call itself because this
will go into an infinite Loop right if
you write a method called sum and then
the sum at inside the sum method you
again invoke the sum method then this
will keep running into Loops till your
program goes out of memory I will show
you the example of that as well but the
basic idea is the use case where if you
have a need where the where the method
wants to call itself that is where you
will use the recursion concept another
thing whatever you can achieve with
recursion generally you can achieve the
same output using for Loops as well but
when you reuse it for for Loops it will
require you to write lot of code
recursion will reduce the number of
lines you need to write and manage in
your code but on the other side
recursion can get a bit complex because
it requires an advanced understanding of
how methods actually work in Java so
before I go any further understand that
methods whatever you define inside the
method that goes on to a stack remember
I covered about stacks and it's a lifo
Arrangement so whatever you define
inside your method all those variables
and all those statements they go on to a
stack and then the stack gets emptied
one by one executing the statement which
is sitting on the top of the stack that
is the concept of the method execution
that under the hood it is using a stack
now when we talk about the recursion it
also follows the same stack insertion
and stack item removal concept that how
do you insert elements into the stack
and how do you remove them so we are
going to walk through an example of
recursion with the help of a use case
called factorial now if you if you have
studied about factorial in your in your
school classes you might remember that
factorial is a way where let's say if I
have to calculate the factorial of 10
then it would be 10 into the factorial
of 9 into the factorial of 8 into the
factorial of 7 so you see I'm repeating
the concept of calculating the factorial
again and again first I am calculating
the factorial of 10 in 10 into factorial
of 9 then I say 9 into factorial of 8
then I say 8 into factorial of 7 then I
say 7 into factorial of 6 and so on so
forth so this is the concept of how do
you calculate factorials another example
where you can use recursion is a
Fibonacci series so when we talk about
this if you Anarchy series the basic
idea is that you sum the previous two
elements and that's how you create the
next element then this then you sum the
immediate previous two and you create
the next element so again you perform
the operation of summing the past two
elements again and again to calculate
the next element so you see again you're
repeating the same operation again and
again so try to identify that particular
thing where you have to repeat the
particular operation again and again on
the whole sequence that would be the use
case where you might be needing to use a
recursion concept so here I have
prepared an example for calculating the
factorial of a number so what you see on
your screen is a class called complex
function and then it has a method called
calculate factorial and inside the
method you supply an argument which is
basically a number for which you want to
calculate the factorial so if you supply
5 a factorial of 5 will be calculated if
you supply 10 a factorial of 10 will be
calculated now the first thing which you
need to do when you write a recursion
function is to know the exit condition
that is probably the most important
concept when you write recursion you
should know when to end the program if
you get it wrong then your program will
start will be stuck into an infinite
Loop and it will only exit when there
would be a stack Overflow basically
there will not be enough memory inside
the jvm to run your program it will
crash technically so remember always to
define a exit condition some people also
call it as a base condition but remember
the base case or base condition or the
exit condition either of the terms can
be used interchangeably but always
remember to First Define the base
condition so here when do you end
calculating the factorial you know the
factorial of 1 is 1 and it cannot go any
further so that would be your base
condition that once if if you if you
encounter a scenario where somebody
inputs one as an argument then you
simply return one because the factorial
of 1 will be 1 so this is your base case
this is what is going to make sure that
your program exits smoothly if you get
it wrong your program will never end it
will go into an endless mode then in the
else condition you write the factorial
logic based on the recursion so like I
said what does a factorial function does
is if you calculate the factorial of 5
then it would be 5 into factorial of 4 4
into factorial of 3 3 into factorial of
2 2 into factorial of 1 and that's when
it will end so here I'm saying let's say
if n was 5 so you say 5 into you again
call back the same function 5 into
calculate factorial of 5 minus 1. so now
again the function will be invoked with
an N equal to 4 it will go here this
condition will not be met because n is 4
it will goes to the else block again the
same thing will happen 4 into calculate
factorial of 3 so you are again invoking
the same function but this time
supplying and as three so it will go
here n will be supplied as 3 it will
again check the base condition and is
still not 3 and is still not 1 so it
will go to the else block so 3 into
calculate factorial of 2 it will again
go up and again it will invoke the
calculate factorial method but this time
with n equal to 2 this condition is
still false because n is still 2 it will
go to the else block and it will say 2
into calculate factorial of 1 it will
again go up this time it will invoke
with n equal to 1 and it will go here
and it will satisfy the condition and
that's where your program will have its
first output you remember previous
execution of 5 into factorial 4 into
factorial 3 into factorial 2 did not
result into an output these were the
executions of the method call which were
just going on the stack so you were just
at first you had the calculate factorial
of 5 on the stack on top of it you had
the calculate factorial 4 on the stack
then you had calculate factorial 3 on
the stack then you had 2 and then you
had one but when you had one your
program did uh received or reached any
particular end so that was your first
output once you have your first output
ready then you go back to the previous
one so the first statement has been
popped now you go back to the calculate
factorial of 2 and you calculate that
once you have the output of that then
you go back to calculate factorial of
three and so you basically unpack the
stack now you basically try to remove
the elements from the stack to visualize
this this is how it will look like that
you first call the factorial five let me
just change the name of it just to make
it look exactly how it will go on the
stack so this is how it is going to go
on the stack so you first you call the
calculate factorial of 5 which in turn
called the calculate factorial 4 which
in turn called calculate factorial 3
calculate factorial 2 calculate
factorial one and once you had the
calculate factorial one you got the
first output and once you have the first
output then you start unpacking it
because you had the value of the
calculate factorial 1 so you can say 2
into calculate factorial once output
calculate factorial once output was 1 so
2 into 1 becomes 2 and this is the
output of calculate factorial 2 right
then it goes to the next step basically
this one sorry this one and calculate
factorial 3 was demonstrated as 3 into
calculate factorial of 2 so 3 into
calculate factorial of 2 which is this
one two so this gets replaced here 2 and
you get the output as six now you have
this one also resolved the next one on
the stack was calculate factorial of 4
which was written as 4 into calculate
factorial of 3 so 4 into calculate
factorial of 3 is output so this
function calls output this functions
call output was 6. it goes back and it
says 4 into 6 24 and you have this one
also calculated now you go to the last
statement which was calculate factorial
of 5 which was written as 5 into
calculate factorial of 4 and calculate
factorial of 4 has been already computed
as 24 so now you can simply say 5 into
24 which is the output of calculate
factorial 4 and you get the output as
120 and this is the final return
statement which will be returned to you
so if you try to understand this till
this particular point you are just
calling function after function after
function with a different value of N and
everything started getting into a result
due to the base condition this was the
base condition and that's why the base
condition is very important now imagine
there was low base condition then this
would never return and it will keep
calling calculate factorial calculate
factorial and it will keep going down
the stairs it will never be able to come
up because there is no base condition
and that's why base condition is very
important at the same time also
understanding how recursion works is
also very important always remember that
the output of the first execution gets
supplied in the second execution the
output of the second execution gets
supplied in the third execution and
that's how the stack unpacks or empties
itself so here I'm just doing the normal
drill here where I am saying complex
function complex function equal to new
complex function and then calling the
calculate factorial method passing 5 to
8 and then printing the eventual result
and if I run this I get the output as
120 which I just walked you through so
remember how to use the recursion why to
use the recursion how to define the base
condition all of these things will will
be of of very much importance when you
try to implement recursions practice
this a lot recursion is a concept which
takes time to to get used to so practice
many different examples and many
questions of recursion and you will be
more confident about it read more about
this concept in the Java docs look at
different examples on the internet that
will help you build more knowledge
around this and that's all I I want to
