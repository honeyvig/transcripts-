the description box below so without any
further Ado let's get started firstly
let us understand what is SQL now SQL is
a programming language designed for
managing and manipulating relational
databases it sounds as a standard way to
interact with databases allowing users
to retrieve insert update and delete
data efficiently SQL provides a logical
and structured approach to organizing
and accessing information stored in
tables using commands such as insert
update modify and delete it basically
enables users to Define relationship
between tables create complex queries
and perform various data operations it
is widely used in web development data
analysis and database management making
it a fundamental tool for handling
structure data efficiently but now comes
the main question why should you learn
SQL now SQL plays an important role for
managing databases and one of the main
reason is it is used to access and
manipulate data present in the databases
using SQL queries now some of the main
reasons why you should be learning SQL
is it retrieves specific data
efficiently now SQL allows you to
retrieve specific data from databases
efficiently with SQL queries you can
extract relevant information from large
data sets based on specific criteria
such as filtering by conditions sorting
and aggregating data so this capability
is crucial for data analysis and
decision making process secondly
powerful tool for data manipulation now
SQL provides powerful tools for
manipulating data you can perform
operations like inserting updating
deletion as well as alternate table data
and its structure sql's data
manipulation capabilities enable you to
transform and modify data according to
your needs ensuring data accuracy and
integrity now it is instrumental in data
integration now SQL plays an important
role in data integration where you need
to integrate data from multiple sources
so by using let's say SQL joint you can
combine data from different tables or
databases based on common fields this
allows you to create comprehensive data
sets for analysis reporting and decision
making and finally aggregation and
summarizing data easily now SQL enables
you to Aggregate and summarize data
easily with the skills aggregate
functions you can calculate metrics such
as some average maximum minimum and
count with its simple syntax so
aggregating data allows you to gain
insights and understand trends at a
higher level fascinating effective
analysis and Reporting now that we have
understood what is SQL let us have a
quick introduction to what is data
science now now data science is a field
that combines statistical analysis
machine learning and programming to
extract insights make predictions and
solve complex problems using data it
involves Collective cleaning and
analyzing vast amounts of structured and
unstructured data to uncover patterns to
derive actionable insights now data
science has been rapidly growing and has
gained importance due to the exponential
growth of data and advancement in
computing power and Technology it will
be integrated into Core Business
processes enabling real-time position
making personalized experiences and
improve operational efficiency and it is
likely to be approached in various
sectors like marketing Finance supply
chain automation customer service
transport and much more so let us now
understand what is the importance of SQL
in data science now the first reason is
efficient data retrieval and
manipulation now SQL is designed
specifically for managing and querying
structured data in relational databases
it provides a powerful set of commands
and functions that enable data
scientists to retrieve filter Aggregate
and manipulate large volumes of data
efficiently seamless integration with
databases now SQL is a standard language
for interacting with relational
databases most organizations store the
data in databases such as MySQL posture
SQL Oracle or SQL Server so being
proficient in SQL allows data scientists
to seamlessly connect to these databases
extract data perform complex queries and
integrate results into the data science
workflows so SQL acts as a bridge
between data stored in databases and the
analytical tools and algorithms used in
data science next data exploration and
Analysis now SQL provides powerful
capabilities for Expo covering and
analyzing data data scientists can use
SQL queries to investigate relationships
between different variables identify
patterns summarize data calculate
statistical methods and create derived
tables so with SQL data scientists can
perform any kind of analysis to generate
summary statistics and gain insights
into underlying data structures which is
crucial for understanding the data
before applying more analytical
techniques and finally database
performance and efficiency now SQL is
designed to optimize data retrieval and
manipulation operations relational
databases are built to handle large
volumes of structured data efficiently
and SQL queries are optimized for
execution now data scientists can
Leverage The indexing and query
optimization capabilities of databases
to improve the performance of their data
operations so these were some of the
main reasons why you should be learning
SQL in data science so let us now
discuss some of the SQL skills that you
need to master in order to apply them in
data science the first firstly having a
good knowledge on relational database
models now we know the field of data
science focuses on studying and
analyzing data to effectively analyze
the data it is necessary to extract in
from the database and for data
scientists having a solid understanding
of how rdbms and SQL works is certainly
valuable as it remains a prevalent and
important technology now rdms is
basically a type of database management
system that organize and stores data in
a structured manner using tables columns
and rows so SQL is a standard language
which is used to interact with these
rdbms and perform various operations
like querying and much more so having a
broader knowledge on rtpms data model is
important for data scientist secondly
having a good knowledge on SQL query
commands now SQL commands are basically
the backbone of querying the databases
right so having a knowledge on various
query commands such as ddl which is help
to define the data structure or schema
or even DML with which allows user to
modify the database instantly by install
starting modifying building data and
data control language which gives access
to the data stored in the database by
granting and revoking permissions and
finally transaction control language
which commands deal with the
transactions within the database so
having a good understanding of all these
SQL commands which allow data scientists
to effectively retrieve manipulate
Define and Control Data in relational
database Management Systems next having
a good knowledge on table constraints
now there are various stable constraints
which are imposed on the table now
constraints are basically a set of rules
imposed on the tables of relational
databases which helps in maintain the
accuracy integrity and reliability of a
database now we have different types of
constraints for example not null foreign
key default unique primary key and check
so these are a few examples of table
constraints in SQL which improves query
performance by creating an index on a
column or set of columns so
understanding and utilizing these
constraints appropriately can help
maintain data consistency and in improve
the reliability of database operations
in data science tasks moving ahead you
have to have a good knowledge on various
SQL key constraints as well now we have
various SQL Keys which is an attribute
or set of attributes which help you to
identify a unique row in a table so SQL
key is basically establish relationship
between multiple tables in our databases
so having a good knowledge on various
Keys like primary key candidate K Super
Key and foreign key is a must for a data
scientist looking ahead having a good
knowledge on SQL aggregation and join
operations now as a data scientist you
have to learn about table relationships
and how to use joins to combine data
from multiple tables so first let us
understand what is aggregate functions
now aggregate function in SQL is
performed on a calculation on multiple
values and returns a single value so you
have to explore various aggregate
functions like sum count average Max and
minimum and understand how to group the
data using a group by clause and apply
aggregate function to calculate summary
statistics on group data also as
discussed you have to have a good
knowledge on joint functions where you
need to combine data from multiple
tables so understand different types of
joints such as inner join left join
right join and full joint now in order
to practice writing these queries that
table joins based on common columns you
have to have a good knowledge on SQL
join functions which is used to join one
or more tables moving ahead having a
good knowledge on SQL classes and
functions now Clauses are inbuilt SQL
functions which are used to filter and
analyze data quickly which in turn
reduces the complexity of a query so
having a good knowledge on various
classes in SQL can surely help data
scientists in order to minimize their
workflow and work on various complex
queries so you have to have a good
knowledge on various classes like where
which is used to filter because in the
database order by cross which sorts the
data either in ascending or descending
order group by clause which is used to
group identical data in order to obtain
summarized database results with
aggregation methods next we have having
clause which filters the rows where
aggregate function meets the specified
conditions that we have given to the
query next having a good knowledge on
limit clause which is used to limit the
number of results from the query and
finally best in clause which discards
the rows with duplicate values and also
familiarize yourself with various window
functions which allows you to perform
calculations learn how to use functions
like a row number rank to perform
database operations on order subsets of
data so practice using window functions
to solve complex analytical problems as
well moving ahead having a strong
knowledge on SQL views and indexing SQL
views and indexing are crucial aspects
of data science when it comes to
efficient data access and Analysis so
what is an SQL view so SQL view is a
virtual table derived from one or more
existing table in a database so it is
created based on a query and behaves
like a regular table but its data is not
physically stored views help data
scientists simplify the queries by
abstracting the underlying complexity so
instead of writing complex joints and
aggregations repeatedly they can create
a view that will encapsulate the
necessary logic this allows for more
concise and readable queries reducing
the potential for any errors and also
having a good indexing strategy will
help retrieve database data quickly by
providing a lookup mechanism and helps a
faster data recovery so when a query
includes a condition on an index column
the database engine can use the index to
locate the relevant data rows directly
instead of scanning the entire table so
which enter will improve the search
efficiency so this significantly speeds
up query execution especially for large
tables and finally sub queries and CT
now SQL sub query and comment table
expressions are powerful features that
data scientists can utilize for Advanced
Data analysis and manipulation now SQL
query which is also known as a nested
query is a query embedded within another
query it allows data science is to
perform complex operations by using the
results of one query as an input for
another on the other hand we have common
table Expressions which is a temporary
named result set that can be referenced
with the SQL statement so it allows data
scientists to create complex queries by
breaking them into smaller and more
readable parts so these are some of the
main SQL skills that you need to master
for a data science role I hope you
understood them clearly and with that we
have come to the end of today's session
guys by mastering all these SQL skills
data scientists can effectively retrieve
manipulate and analyze data stored in
complex relational databases and perform
operations optimize their performance
