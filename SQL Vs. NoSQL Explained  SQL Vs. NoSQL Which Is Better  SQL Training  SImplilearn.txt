Ado let's get started SQL databases
provide robustness and consistency
through structured data schemes ideal
for complex queries and transactions on
the hand the no SQL databases so they
offer flexibility and scalability by
ensuring the structured approach of SQL
databases allowing for easier management
of unstructured data now it's obvious
that both these platforms have a huge
demand for their specific needs and
requirements now the major question for
today's session is which one of these
two has the higher demand and best
suitable for most of the use cases and
what are the critical differences
between the both and which one of these
differences that you need to discuss and
consider before getting started with a
SQL based
project right so that said let's get
started by understanding each one of
these and popular database management
tools and the critical differences
between the both starting with the
agenda for today's
session firstly we will discuss major
companies which are dependent on SQL
developers and which are actively hiring
SQL as well as no SQL developers next we
will discuss the salaries offered to a
certified SQL and no SQL Developer and
after that we will understand what
exactly is SQL then the popular SQL data
basis followed by that we will
understand what is no SQL with a brief
introduction to both and then what are
the popular new SEC dat bases which have
being currently used in the IT industry
and next we will close with the most
important part of today's session which
happens to be the critical differences
between the both SQL and non SQL
databases having said that I hope I made
myself clear with the agenda now let's
proceed with the companies hiring SQL
and nosql developers now SQL and nosql
databases are the most popular databases
which are currently actively used in the
ID industry some of the major companies
product based companies or service based
companies which are dependent on SQL and
no SQL dates are as follows majorly the
man big for and many more like PepsiCo
exano well Faro Cap Gemini Netflix and
many more like IBM Walmart are solely
dependent on dbas Management systems and
these are the companies which are ready
to pay huge compensation for the
certified developers who know SQL or no
SQL now let's also discuss about the
huge paychecks they're offering to the
certified developers in s and most s so
if you are in America and if you know
your this management then they are ready
to offer you the salaries from $90,000
to $100,000 prum if you are a beginner
and if you're an intermediate candidate
let's say with about one to two years of
experience you can expect salaries
ranging from $100,000 to $110,000 per
anom and if you are an experienced
highly experienced candidate with about
four or five or more experience then you
can expect salar R from $120,000 to
$130,000 or even more based on the
company you're working with and on the
project you're working for and if you're
in India and if you're a beginner in SQL
development or no SQL developing from
three lakhs to six lakhs perom and if
you're an intermediate candidate let's
say two to three years of experience you
can expect salaries ranging from six
lakhs to 8 lakhs per anom and if you're
a highly experienced candidate let's say
more than 5 years of experience you can
expect around 8 lakhs to 12 lakhs perom
as a minimum or average salary and the
number can go as high as 40 lakhs 50 LX
panum based on the company you're
working with or based on the technology
let's say like article Etc or on the
project you're working for right so
based on that your number can go as high
as 35 to 40 lakhs per anom so that's the
importance of SQL so it's a good time
for you to get certified as a SQL
Developer or a no SQL Developer now
let's proceed with the next part of
today's session where we will be
understanding what exactly is SQL
so what is SQL so there are many
definitions to SQL some say it is a tool
some say it is a programming language
but as a full form for it SQL stands as
an appervation for structured query
language majorly proving that it is
basically a language now it is a domain
specific language used to manage data
especially so we have DML ddl right so
especially related to DBS management
system it is helpful for handling
structure data by incorporating
relationships among the entities what we
call also as tables right it's primary
key foreign key using which you can
establish a successful relation between
them and try to join both the tables and
extract data now let's also discuss some
of the features of these SQL dat
behs so SQL will help you keep track of
your transactions and SQL will help you
with data loading from different sources
apart from that SQL offers top notot
security and then it also helps you with
data transformation and userfriendly
user interfaces now we have a brief
understanding of what exactly is SLE now
let's proceed with understanding some
popular SQL databases which are
currently being used in the ID
sector so some of the popular databases
of SQL that are actively used in the ID
sector are article mongod DV post SQL
Microsoft SQL Server Azure redis elastic
search MySQL and anyal now let's proceed
with what exactly is no SQL so there are
uh many concepts of no SQL some say it
is no SQL or somebody say that it is not
only SQL meaning it can perform more
than what just SQL do right so the
definition that we have for no SQL is no
SQL is an approach to these design that
focuses on providing a mechanism for
storage and retrival of data that is
modeled in music other than TBL
relationships used in relation vares so
as we said that SQL can manage data
which is only present in data tables
under named columns and rows right apart
from that we cannot do anything but in
SQL you can rely on that for handling
not non structured or unstructured data
as well apart from just handling the
data cables it can do a lot more than
that it can also help you manage the
nonstructured or unstructured data like
media photos and everything now let's
also understand some of the popular
features of
Nole so no SQL databases are easily
scalable and they you can expect high
performance through no SQL da basis and
similar to SQL no SQL is also capable of
offering High and security and
replication of data or shifting data
from one place to another is also very
easy using no SQL and lastly no SQL
databases can be updated very easily
without any hassle now let's proceed
with understanding some of the popular
databases based on nosql
platform so some of the popular nosql
databases are Raven DV mongod DV yes
mongod DV can also work with S as well
as no s followed by that we have Apache
Cassandra one of the popular DD pces
created by Facebook and next we have
Dynamo DB from Amazon cach DB Apache
Edge space which is also from Apache and
Neo 4i and also redus now that we have a
comfortable understanding of what
exactly is a noq database its features
and some popular databases which are
currently being used on the IT industry
so we have a comfortable understanding
of both SQL as with asq basis now calls
for the major part of today's session
which is the critical differences
between so SQL versus no SQL so the
first difference so as we discussed SQL
deals with named columns and rows and
the data is stored in a tablet form like
an Excel spreadsheet so SQL supports the
relation dbas management system on the
other hand no SQL supports both
relational as well as it can support non
relational database management system so
basically it tries to function on the
fundamentals of non- relation management
system now the second point of
difference is data storage so SQL
chooses to store data under name rows
and columns in a table format on the
other hand no SQL prefers to store data
in the form of Collections and documents
so what are Collections and documents in
nol passs so those are just some
interchangeable data formats which are
human and machine readable so those are
the files which store data in the form
of Json and Bon formats which are
readable by Machine ands now let's
proceed with the third point of
discussion so the point three is SQL
follows asset properties but no SQL will
not or maybe need not to follow asset
properties so what are asset properties
and seq so basically asset is in full
form for atomicity consistency and
isolation and curability so first let's
understand what is a a is atomicity
where each statement is a transaction
right and it is treated as a SLE unit
either the entire statement is executed
or none of them is executed next
consistency ensuring that the
transactions only made changes to the
tables in a predefined and predictable
ways transaction consistency ensures
that corruption or errors in your data
do not create unintended consequences
for the Integrity of your table next one
is I isolation so when multiple users
are reading or writing from the same
table all at once isolation of their
transactions ensures that the concurrent
transactions do not interfere or affect
one another now the last one D for
durability ensures that changes to your
data made by successfully executed
transactions will be saved even in the
event of system favor so these are the
abset properties which SQL abides and
follows but no SQL may or may not or
need not to follow these asset
properties now the fourth point which is
about the complex joints and queries now
SQL supports the types of joints maybe
the inner joint outer joint left joint
outer join and cross join Etc and it can
also support some complex queries like
CTE and sub ques Etc but no SQL on the
other hand does not support these joints
and complex queries now the last point
of L is discussion between both so SQL
is dependent on vertical scaling and no
SQL is dependent on horizontal scaling
now what is vertical scaling and
horizontal scaling so let's say you have
a database and you are managing some
website or something like that and you
have a bunch of requests which are
additional requests on your current
request let's say you have 100 requests
today and tomorrow you're expecting to
have about 120 queries right in such
scenario if you are using a no SQL
database then you can just expand the
network let's say you have five buses
today to handle those 100 requests and
tomorrow you have additional 20 right in
such scenario what you do is just add a
no SLE dat P one extra we will be having
one more dedicated for that extra 20
queries that's called horizontal scaling
just add another DDP to your existing
network but on the other hand when you
come to SQL it is dependent on vertical
scal let's say you are having just one
database to handle 100 queries and
tomorrow you get an additional 40 or 50
queries in such scenario you cannot just
add an extra ddps what you have to do is
you may have to add some extra juice to
your server right let's say your server
or database can have about 100 GB of
processing capability you need to
increase that processing capability to
150g basically you're upgrading your
Hardware you are not just adding more
Hardware you're upgrading it in such
scenario it is mentioned or it is called
as vertical scale so SQL is dependent on
vertical scaling and no SQL is dependent
on horizontal scaling for additional
requests so these are the top five
differences between SQL and no SQL so
before you get started with a database
project these are the five differences
that you need to consider and understand
andure and that brings us to the end of
this session on the differences between
SQL and no SQL should you have any
