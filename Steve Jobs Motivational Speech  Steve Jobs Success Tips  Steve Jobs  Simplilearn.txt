after six months i couldn't see the
value in it
i had no idea what i wanted to do with
my life and no idea how college was
going to help me figure it out
so i decided to drop out and trust that
it would all work out okay
it was pretty scary at the time but
looking back it was one of the best
decisions i ever made the minute i
dropped out
i could stop taking the required classes
that didn't interest me
and begin dropping in on the ones that
looked far more interesting
it wasn't all romantic
i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on
the floor in friends rooms
i returned coke bottles for the five
cent deposits to buy food with
and i would walk the seven miles across
town every sunday night
to get one good meal a week at the hari
krishna temple and much of what i
stumbled into by following my curiosity
and intuition turned out to be priceless
later on you can't connect the dots
looking forward you can only connect
them looking backwards
so you have to trust that the dots will
somehow connect in your future
you have to trust in something your gut
destiny life karma whatever
because believing that the dots will
connect down the road
will give you the confidence to follow
your heart
even when it leads you off the well-worn
path and that will make all the
difference
i was lucky i found what i loved to do
early in life
woz and i started apple in my parents
garage when i was 20.
we worked hard and in 10 years apple had
grown from just the two of us in a
garage into a two billion dollar company
with over 4 000 employees
we just released our finest creation the
macintosh a year earlier and i just
turned 30.
so at 30 i was out
and very publicly out
what had been the focus of my entire
adult life was gone and it was
devastating
i really didn't know what to do for a
few months
i was a very public failure and i even
thought about running away from the
valley
but something slowly began to dawn on me
i still loved what i did the turn of
events at apple had not changed that one
bit
i'd been rejected but i was still in
love
and so i decided to start over
i didn't see it then
but it turned out that getting fired
from apple was the best thing that could
have ever happened to me
the heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a
beginner again less sure about
everything
it freed me to enter one of the most
creative periods of my life
during the next five years i started a
company named next another company named
pixar and fell in love with an amazing
woman who would become my wife
pixar went on to create the world's
first computer animated feature film toy
story and is now the most successful
animation studio in the world
in a remarkable turn of events
apple bought next and i returned to
apple
i'm pretty sure
none of this would have happened if i
hadn't been fired from apple
it was awful tasting medicine but i
guess the patient needed it
sometimes people come to me and say i
want to start a company and i say why he
said oh i want to make lots of money
i said forget it that's not a good
enough reason you will not most likely
you will not succeed most people that
have started companies because they want
to make lots of money i haven't seen
very many of those succeed
the ones that succeed are people that
come sometimes they don't even want to
start a company they just have an idea
that they want to get out expressed out
in the world and oftentimes they have to
start a company because nobody else will
listen to them
my entire life's been spent only in one
industry which is this one
and but i've been in it now for about 15
years and i've seen a lot of people make
a lot of things i've seen a lot of
people fail a lot of things and my my
point of view on this or my observation
is
that
the doers are the major thinkers
uh the people that really create the
things that change this industry are
both the think or doer in one person
and if we really go back and we examine
uh you know did leonardo have a guy off
to the side that was thinking five years
out in the future what he would paint or
the technology he would use to paint it
of course not
leonardo was the artist but he also
mixed all his own paints he also was a
fairly good chemist knew about pigments
knew about human anatomy and combining
all of those skills together the art and
the science the thinking and the doing
was what resulted in the exceptional
result
and there is no difference in our
industry the people that have really
made the contributions have been the
thinkers and the doers
when you uh a lot of people of course
it's it's very easy to take credit for
the thinking
uh the doing is more concrete but
somebody is very easy for somebody say
oh i thought of this three years ago
but
usually when you dig a little deeper you
find that the people that really did it
were also the people that really worked
through the hard intellectual problems
as well
[Music]
sometimes life's going to hit you in the
head with a brick
don't lose faith
i'm convinced that the only thing that
kept me going was that i loved what i
did you've got to find what you love and
that is as true for work as it is for
your lovers
your work is going to fill a large part
of your life and the only way to be
truly satisfied is to do what you
believe is great work and the only way
to do great work is to love what you do
if you haven't found it yet keep looking
and don't settle
as with all matters of the heart you'll
know when you find it and like any great
relationship it just gets better and
better as the years roll on so keep
looking
don't settle
