hey guys this is Matt welcome back to
zen and the art of trading today's video
is gonna be extremely short I'm just
going to explain to you guys how to add
alerts to your scripts so you can add
this alert functionality to scripts that
you create or scripts that you download
from other people say you find a script
on tradingview that you like they look
off but it doesn't generate alerts by
adding this functionality to the script
you can basically turn any script out
there into an alert generating script so
I'm gonna be building off lesson 4 so if
you haven't watched that video I'll
leave a link in the video description
and go back and watch how we did this
the script just generates RSI signal so
when the RSI goes overboard or oversold
it just plots as visual signals to the
chart so I'm just gonna rename this to
lesson 5 now this is going to be
extremely simple we're just adding one
line of code here and this is going to
send out an alert if this particular
candle meets our conditions so all you
need to type here is alert condition
open parenthesis and now this function
here takes three inputs takes a boolean
input which is the trigger for the alert
if the boolean is true then the alert is
sent out it takes a title which is for
the pop-up box and the email heading and
it takes a message which is like the
body the text body of the alert so I'll
explain all this as I go first of all
the bully and we're going to combine
these two boolean values here into one
so what we're going to do here is were
going to say if the RSI is overbought or
the RSI is oversold , this alert will be
triggered now the title of the alert is
going to be RSI signal and then we'll
put another comma and then the message
is going to be set to RSI signal
detected for and now trading view added
this
this new cool alert functionality here
where you can use these placeholders
special placeholders in order to inject
certain information from the chart so
you can inject the closing price at a
time etc if you hit the question mark
here it'll do it have a whole list of
things so what we're going to use here
is probably just the ticker the ticker
will do so you can see here that if you
were to use all of this text this is
what it would replace as so you can
reference the exchange or the in forex
this case the broker you can list the
ticker symbol the currency pair in our
case you could have the price on there
and volume and there's a whole bunch of
things you can choose from so I'll leave
that for you to look through in today's
example we're just going to be using
ticker so if I just throw that in there
hit save that's literally it this script
is now ready to generate email and pop
up alerts SMS alerts push notifications
all of that stuff straight to your phone
whenever one of these signals is
generated so it's amazingly simple it's
what my fit one of my favorite things
about trading view is how simple they
make this stuff and just quickly before
I move on I just thought I should better
point out the fact that if you hover
your mouse over a function did you run
familiar with it'll tell you exactly
what inputs it takes so you can see here
it takes a condition a title and a
message and if you hold down ctrl or
command on a Mac and you click on the
function it will pop up this help box
which will explain in great detail what
the function does so now if you hit the
create alert button the way that you
would set an alert for the script is you
just come down here and click the name
of your script and that's it it's ready
to go you select your options here
notify an app show pop-up etc you can
play a sound whatever you like and you
can change the message down here so yeah
that's up to you that's personal all of
this is personal preference but up here
in under options you can set how the
alert is triggered so you can set set it
trigger only once and that means that if
the signal shows up on your chart you
get one alert and then the alert will
disable itself once per bar means that
it will repeat every time there's a new
bar so if you get multiple signals like
this it'll send out an alert on this one
then you won't get an alert for these
this to these two candles here but then
you get another one here another one
another one all in a row so that's
pretty helpful for day trading but if
you are trading in the higher time
frames it just gets annoying so you
probably don't want to have that set my
favorite one to use is once per bar
closed so this will only trigger see
once per bar will trigger even before
the candle closes so if you get an alert
here say that this next candle went
overboard and then you got an alert st.
was overbought but then the candle
closed and the signal was invalidated
you still get an alert even though the
setup didn't really occur so once per
bar closed is my personal favorite
setting to use that means it will only
send out alerts for confirmed signals
and once per minute it's
self-explanatory
and that's it all you do is hit create
it'll be added to your list of alerts
let me clear out some of these inactive
alerts and there you go done simple as
that so if I just quickly change these
settings to the traditional RSI values
just for this example hit OK and create
a new alert
I'll take show pop-up so we'll get an
actual pop-up to my screen I'll change
this to that change it to once per bar
closed and hit create then once this
candle closes here we should get an
alert sent to our charting platform and
my phone so let's wait and see what
happens
three two one dawn and there we go
there's our alert and I can hear my
screen beeping in the background she's
probably gonna wake my girlfriend up
it's a bit early here in the morning so
whoops forgot about that but anyway
that's it done so that's the end of this
lesson
good luck with your trading good luck
with your coding and I'll see you in the
next lesson where we'll go over how to
detect
patterns see there have a great day
goodbye
