without further delay let's get started
with our topic for today that is
building an interactive tblo dashboard
so if you are a beginner in Tabo and if
you want to understand what exactly you
you can perform data visualization in
table and create an interactive
dashboard then this particular tutorial
will be the perfect one for you so we
will quickly create an interactive
dashboard and we will be using some
sales data set from European nations and
we will try to perform some data
visualizations and try to extract some
important insights and finally segregate
all the charts and graphs that we
created into an interactive dashboard at
the end so that's the agenda for today's
session so let's get started with the
latest version of t that is 2023 version
there you go we just got started with
the tblue public desktop now here the
data set that we are going to deal with
is a Microsoft Excel version so TBL will
help you get connected with text files
Json files Microsoft Access PDF file
spatial file statistical file and much
more and you can also get connected to
realtime Service as well but now we will
be connecting to Microsoft Excel data
set so you can just click on Microsoft
Excel and here here I have Excel data
sets and out of which we will be working
today with the table sales EU that is
European sales click on that so don't
worry if you want the data set or if you
want to continue with me to work on this
particular data set then I will be
linking that particular data set link in
the description box below you can
download the data set and uh you know
learn in real time with me as we go
ahead building this particular dashboard
so we have uh got connected to our data
set as you can see so here we have the
columns and rows and we have the cells
filled with data so here we have row ID
order ID order date ship date ship mode
customer ID customer name segment City
Etc so these are the uh columns and
column headers or in normal sense or in
um you know uh short sense you can call
it as the metadata of the data that we
are dealing with today right now we can
straight up we go go ahead with the
first worksheet and here we have all the
dimensions and here we have all the
measures so the qualitative data in your
data set is called as Dimension and the
quantitative data we have on a data set
is called as measures so here we have
filters marks and everything that we
need here we will be dragging and
dropping the columns and rows so let's
get started with the first story or chat
which is about the kpi of your sales so
this particular sheet will help you
understand the key performance
indicators of your data set so we will
be like having how many number of U
customers do we have in a you know a
particular State City Country Etc and we
will be having how many number of orders
we received how many number of uh sales
we got from them what's the quantity of
uh products the ordered and what's the
profit everything in one single you know
story right so we will be dragging the
required measures and dimensions onto
the rows and columns so firstly let's
try to drag the customer IDs right we'll
place the customer IDs add all the
members so we will be creating a small U
you know measure here will change the
measure to count disting So currently it
is taking up all the customers which are
available in the data set which may be
in thousands so we don't want all the
data sets over here so so we will just
have the count count distinct uh
customers there you go we have around
800 customers so maybe uh few customers
got redundant uh in buying the product
from the website now let's continue with
a few more options that we want to have
on our kpi so okay let's go with product
ID so that we have how many number of
products they uh you know purchase from
the website so add all the members same
as customer customers so you can go with
product and here you have measure change
the measure to count we are not going to
use count desting here we're going to
count here so we have the actual number
of how many number of products that have
been ordered now let's go with the
quantity here what's the quantity that
they have ordered hold and drag it onto
the so don't worry currently you can see
we have a bar graph over here we can
change this into a taba format from
this particular available option over
here which named which is named as show
me now we have a quantity over here
let's quickly close it now next will be
sales and then lastly we have the profit
sum of sales sum of quantity and sum of
profit right so everything is good to go
and now what you can do is just change
this particular chart from bar graph to
taable graph right now you can again
ship this to the column so that you have
a table format and here you can edit
this edit alas product ID or products so
this will give you the number of
products which have been ordered from
the customers and instead of distinct
count of customers you can edit this to
read it as
customers so you'll get to know how many
number of customers you have so in the
interactive dashboard that we are going
to create we will be having a place
where we can we will be having an option
where we can select a state or a region
or a city or a country and get to know
what's happening in that particular
country what's what are the sales
numbers right you get to know that
now if you uh format this you have
alignment where you can Center align all
the text here or or or the um you know
table headers or column headers
and so it will be in the
center font if you want to increase your
font you can do that I'll go with
18 it's not working for some reason
let's select this and try once
again there you go now we have uh the
bigger headers now we also want this
particular you know numbers to be in a
uh to be mentioned in in a bigger font
so you can do that by just clicking on
this go to automatic and should be
centered and here select this particular
text the entire text and increase the
size to about 16 or 18 and if you want
you can bold the numbers and if you
don't want to bold them you can keep it
as it is and apply okay there you go and
here we have standard uh look we can
select this as entire view so that you
have a bigger uh space to show the
numbers so when you drag this to the
dashboard you will have a bigger space
to Showcase your numbers there now with
that we have finished the first chart
that we wanted now let's continue with
the second chart where we will try to
understand a product wise or you know
segment wise
sale now for that we will try to drag
the categories or subcategory iies okay
we'll try to drag the subcategories into
columns and sales to
rows there you go now you have the
category wise sales which category is
giving you highest number of sales Etc
you can either you know order them in
ascending order or descending order we
will now order them in descending order
and if you want to know the um products
or the subcategories which are
performing above average sales then can
do one thing you can try to add an
average SE know segregator go to
analytics and here you can find average
line you can add that average line by
double clicking on that and here you
have the average sales numbers right so
the average sales numbers in this
particular line will tell you the what's
the average sale number which is1
72,8
129 and now if you want to segregate
these uh subcategories into the ones
which are performing above average and
the ones which are per Performing below
average then you can do that as well go
to data again and here you have an
option to create a new calculated
field and here uh you can you know
rename this calculation as
products
or
degrees above
average and here you can write down the
formula sum of
sales then
some
of there you go it's valid press okay
and if you drag this particular newly
created calculated field onto the color
it will give you two different colors
and in case if you want to modify it you
can do that as well just highlight you
know edit colors and now here you can
select green color for the ones which
are performing good and uh for the ones
which are not performing good you can
turn them into a different shade maybe
this particular one and press apply and
okay there you go now you have them okay
true edit colors for true you can select
green and press okay there you go now
you have the top uh 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven
performing subcategories which are
giving you above average sales or
profits now you can rename this sheet
as
category VI
sales subcategory by
sales now next what you can do is
location wise if you want to perform a
location wise sales chart they can do
that as well location wise so here you
can drag
your city or
country and here you can drag your sales
to
rowes here you can choose the
map there you go now you have the region
wise sales and the darker shade will
give you the highest number of sales and
the lighter shade will give you the
lowest number of sales so here you have
a legend which explains you
8,638 is the lowest number of sale and 8
lakh
58931 is the highest number of sand if
you want to edit this edit the colors if
you don't like the colors you can also
go back here and choose the one which
you like so I'd like to go with a green
gold shade where gold or yellow shade
will explain you that the lowest number
of sales are happening in that
particular region and the darker ones
tells you that the darker regions are
the ones with the highest number of
sales so now let's go ahead with the
next type of chart where you can find
out the region wise sales right in our
particular data set if you go back to
the data source here here you can see we
have something called as region so which
will tell you about the south north east
west and Central right so now we can
also find out the region why sales so
let's
get region wise and you can drag region
onto columns or rows and uh sales to row
there you go now you have central region
east region North Region and South
Region you can drag region again onto
the colors so that you have a different
color for a different region there you
go now you have different regions for
different colors and uh so far we have
the kpi subcategory sales okay if you
drag some of sales or sales which is
right over here onto the label you have
the numbers as well okay it looks it
looks more clearer now and location wise
sales as well and if you want you can
drag a
country let's TR a lot clumsy then we
will not use it but if it's a little
clearer we can use
it
lab region by sales now you can have the
sales onto the label we have numbers for
that so we have region wise kpi sub
category location and now if I want to
calculate the month- on Monon sales or
year- on-ear sales so our particular
data set has year on year as well so we
have about four to five years of data
set so let's try to calculate the month
on month and year on
year you can drag all the date onto
columns and
fails to thr there you go now we have
here so starting from any any date which
is previous to 2020 or it is null uh it
is considered as zero after the next one
we have 2020 21 22 and 23 now let's say
I want the data of only 2023 so you can
also do that just by you know clicking
here you have 2020 21 22 23 years data
here uh so we will you know divide it
into months we will eliminate the
quarter so so now we have a month on
month sales for every year now what you
can do is let's say if I want to have
only the uh data for 2023 I can double
click on that and it'll give me only the
data for 2023 and uh you can also now
drag the sum of sales sales into color
so that you have a different color for
everything which shows the least color
where we have the lowest to sale and the
highest color for the highest sale now
you can also change the color if you
don't like the blue one you can go with
a different color so you can go with
something around U green there you go so
you have the darker green shade for uh
highest number of sales on the lower uh
green shade for the lowest number of
sales so month- on Monon sales for
2023 and if you want to make some
changes to it you can also do that here
you have this type of uh graph which
will show you the
details okay so now we have it so we
have added some of sales to label and we
have the numbers over here with the
dotted indicators now we have kpi
location wise sales region wise sales
and month on month uh in 2023 let's
check out if we can do anything else
with the data set that we have here if
we can build any uh other uh you know uh
graph and demographics about the date so
we have ship mode here so let's try to
calculate which ship mode is giving us
the maximum amount of profits so which
mode should we use if we are trying to
you know uh generate some good profit so
we'll try to uh you know add profit into
the color so that we have different
colors so standard class is the one
which is generating us the highest
number of profits and and you can also
you know try to create a descending go
here there you go you can name it ship
mode
profits now you can also create another
dashboard where you can identify the
quantity of products ordered so quantity
the quantity to rows or columns and the
subcategory right which subcategory has
the highest number of uh you know uh
quantity ordered so add sub category to
different colors that we have different
colors you can reorganize them there you
go so far we have uh 1 2 3 4 5 six seven
and eight uh stories so you can you know
uh drag all the stories onto the final
dashboard so here we have the final
dashboard and if you want to make some
modifications to your dashboard you can
increase or decrease the width of your
dashboard so let let us do
that let's check the height and
width now if you want to customize your
dashboard by adding an image in the
background you can also do that just
drag an image fit the image Center image
and uh choose the image from your
desktop I'll choose this particular one
and apply there you go and in case if
you don't want any images onto your
desktop or the dashboard you can quickly
cro that
right now you can continue with the
dashboard here we have the kpi U story
first you can drag it over here and you
have the perfect numbers right on your
dashboard and now you can drag the
subcategory sales just drag
them or you can change the subcategory
sales into a bar graph change the
color this to Green dashboard here it is
there you go now you can also increase
or decrease the size of of your uh
kpi there you go now let's try to add
the location wise sales here we have the
location wise sales region wise sales
month on-month sales right
here let's try to add the shipment which
can go
here there you go now the last one is
the quantity which can be added right
here there you go now here we have
another Legend where you can select the
individual let's say I want the data
only from Central so you have the
central data here the order and sales
States and let's say I want everything
and I want I can change my location so
if you uh drag a little if you remove
the
selection
and uh if you would like to go with the
location wise
data you can also do
that let's say I want the data only for
Switzerland you can just click on it and
you get the sales for only Switzerland
and uh if you want some other you know
let's say Finland just click on it and
you'll get the data for Finland so
that's how you create an interactive
dashboard so you can see here we have 33
customers from from Finland theyed 64
projects products and we have about
$33,900 of profit and we sold about $21
number of goods and the sales figure is
20,7 not4 right and we also have the
subcategories over here and here we have
the quantity region wi sales everything
and uh that's how you create an
interactive dashboard in tblo and with
that we have come to an end of this
session on creating a tblo dashboard if
