cryolite
now let's see the historical evolution
of fluoride
we will see the history of it let's go
now
historical evolution of fluoride the
history of fluoridation
started with a rival of frederick mackay
in coloration springs colorado usa in
1901
jessica meets dr frederick mackay
hey dr frederick mckay hey dear
glad to see you sir i would like to know
how did you find the fluoride in 1901
while i was practicing in usa in 1901 i
found that many patients of usa were
having permanent
stain on their teeth which was known to
locally a stain
i thought and i decided to give name to
that stain
so i gave name to them the modeled
enamel
i know one dr frederick mackay called
those stains as a bottled enamel
oh great work
what happened after that in 1912 dash i
found an article written by dr j.m eager
in 1902 he reported unusual occurrence
of brownish-colored stains among the
majority of resident in naples
1902 jm eager given the name dante
eager had termed this brownish
discoloration dundee dale chill
i am eager to know more sir what you did
then
then i confirmed that this unknown
element is present in water
and this element is a definite cause of
enamel modeling

1931-the mysterious factor was
identified in its name is given fluoride
1931 the mysterious factor was
identified and its name was given
fluoride do you know what is the shoe
leather survey
no dr dean will tell you about the next
part of this fluorite journey
hi i am dr trendy h dean
i conducted shoe leather survey among 21
cities in 10 states of the usa
the main aim to establish this survey
was the fluoride and which was the
causative factor for the modeling of
enamel
then what was the result of this survey
well i got to know that as high
concentration of fluoride and water the
more severe was enamel metallic
no modelling was widespread in areas
with having fluoride content of 3 ppm
modeling was discrete pitting of enamel
was noticed at fluoride level of 4 ppm
modeling was less in case of fluoride
level of 2.5 to 3 ppm
with the dull chalky white appearance of
tea and there was no modeling appeared
with an area contain fluoride of 1 ppm
in 1942 dean developed a standard system
of classification of ferrosis the
moteling index known as dean's index of
fluorosis
in 1945 world's first artificial
fluoridation plant was started at grand
rapids usa
in 1969 wh advocated that one ppm of
fluoride in community water supply and
effective public health measure
