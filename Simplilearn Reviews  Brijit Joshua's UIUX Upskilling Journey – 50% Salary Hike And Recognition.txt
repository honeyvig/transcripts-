it's tough handling additional
responsibilities but the hard work pays
off I was working as a business
development professional helping my
organization to onboard new clients I
enroll in simply learned uiux design
expert Masters program after finishing
the program my company acknowledged my
dedication promoting me to a brand
ambassador role with a 50% salary hike
hi I'm bridet Joshua I'm the ambassador
of noai Management consultancy Services
after my graduation I started my career
as a marketing and Business Development
professional since childhood I always
had a passion for pursuing a creative
career this made me think of learning
uux designing at that time our
organization also did not have any
in-house uux designer since I had a Keen
Eye for aesthetic and Technology I
decided to grab this opportunity and
upskill myself in the uiio design but
this came with additional responsibility
as I would have to learn and work then
is when I came across simply learn and
enroll in their uiu course from the
moment I enrolled I was impressed by the
userfriendly platform the industry
experts had a passion for teaching they
provided real world examples throughout
the course the Hands-On projects and
assignments challenged me to apply my
newly acquired skills and practical
scenarios Blended learning was a feature
that helped me to balance my work and
studies
with the help of knowledge that I
acquired I onboarded new clients since
there was no UI designer in my company
at that moment I stepped in and my
company recognized my dedication and
promoted me to a brand ambassador role
with a 50% salary hike apart from my
professional life I like gaming and
designing in my leisure time I do
whiteboard animation and also I'm a
drummer my long-term career goal is to
become a chief design officer someday I
recommend simply learn to folks who are
looking to upscale in uiux and I would
like to thank simply
