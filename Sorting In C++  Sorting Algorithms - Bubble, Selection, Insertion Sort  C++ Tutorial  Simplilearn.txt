hey everyone this is harsh bharadwaj and
welcome back to another video by simply
learn
in this session we will learn about
sorting in c plus
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
we will learn what is sorting in c plus
then the categories of sorting which are
internal and external sorting
after that we will understand types of
sorting in c plus that are bubble sort
selection sort insertion sort and quick
sort
and at last we will understand sorting
using c
library
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
so first is
what is sorting in c
plus sorting in c plus plus is a concept
in which the elements of array are
rearranged in a logical order
now this order can be from the lowest to
the highest or highest to the lowest
rearranging them in a sorted order helps
in dealing with many problems like
searching the maximum element or the
minimum element from an array of
elements
in c plus sorting is categorized into
two types that is internal sorting and
external sorting
so let's understand these
in internal sorting the data to be
sorted is present in the main memory
and the process of sorting will also
take place in the main memory itself
while in case of external sorting the
data is not always present in the main
memory because the data is large
so data is filled in the main memory in
small portions
so this is the difference between
internal sorting and external sorting
now coming to types of sorting in c plus
there are various types of sorting in c
plus that are bubble sort selection sort
insertion sort and quick sort
so let's start with bubble sort
bubble sort is one of the easiest
sorting techniques in c plus
in this technique the comparisons are
done starting from the first two
elements
the adjacent elements are compared if
the element on the left is greater than
the element in the right then the
swapping is done
and it will proceed till the end of the
array
so first the comparison will start from
the first two elements that are 22 and
13
and as we know that 22 on the left is
greater than 13
so we will swap these elements and make
them 13 on the left and 22 on the right
now it became 13 22 5 7 11.
so now we will compare 22 which is at
index 1 with 5 that is at index 2
and as 22 is greater than 5 we will swap
these elements as well
then again we will compare it with the
next element
and if 22 is greater than that element
as well then we will swap them as well
so in this way round one of comparison
is complete as one of the element
reached its actual position
two more rounds of the comparisons will
occur till the array becomes sorted
it is because for n elements the number
of comparison are n minus 1
so number of comparisons here would be 3
as the elements are 4 in numbers
now
coming to selection sort
in this selection sort technique
the smallest element is fetched by
comparing itself with the rest of the
elements
and is sorted at the first position of
the array
once the first element is sorted
the search for second minimum element
begins from the rest of the array and is
positioned at the second place
similarly one by one all the elements
are positioned like this
so this is selection sort
now
moving to insertion sort technique
in this sorting technique the elements
are sorted by comparing the second
element with the first element
if the second element is smaller than
the first
then we will swap it
after that we will compare the third
element with all the elements that are
before it
similarly it goes for the fourth element
and so on
once all the comparisons are done the
elements becomes sorted
as we can see in the figure
so this was insertion sort technique
next is quick sort technique or quick
sort algorithm
quick sort algorithm is one of the most
widely used algorithm and the most
efficient sorting
algorithm the quick sort algorithm
follows a divide and conquer approach
in this approach a paper element is
selected and the array is partitioned
into two halves on the basis of this
pivot element
the elements that are smaller than the
pivot element are shifted to the left
side of it and elements greater than the
pivot element are shifted to the right
side of it
after this
both the left and the right sub arrays
are sorted and combined
for example
let's suppose we have 6 elements
5 15 1 8 22 and 6
and we want to sort them using quick
sort so first of all we will select any
pivot element let's say 6.
now we will divide the array to two sub
arrays based on the pivot element
in such a way that the elements smaller
than the pivot element are on the left
and the elements greater than the pivot
element are on the right as you can see
in the figure elements smaller than 6
are on the left and elements
greater than 6 are on the right
now we will sort both of these sub
arrays separately
we will select a pivot element from each
of the sub array
like we can see
from the first sub array we have
selected 5 and the second sub array we
have selected 15.
similarly if the element is less than
the pivot element then adjust it on the
left otherwise on the right
by doing this both the sub arrays will
become sorted and now we can combine
them to become a complete sorted array
so this is how quicksort algorithm works
so as we have understood about the
sorting technique
now let's understand how to sort using c
library
we can sort using the c
library as well
to use that library function we must
include the hash include algorithm
header file
this function compares each and every
element within the range
the syntax of function is sort
then
within the brackets there will be the
starting iterator and the ending
iterator
and we must include this algorithm
header file with hash include which is a
preprocessor
so as we have understood about these
sorting algorithms
so let's move to our code editor that is
vs code to do some examples on this
sorting algorithms
all right so this is our code editor and
here we will do some examples of sorting
techniques
so let's first of all create a new file
and let's name it
sort
one dot cpp
so let's add first of all
the header file hash include iostream
then the name space standard
so first of all we will do an example of
bubble sort algorithm
and now we will create
the main function
inside the main function we will create
some variables
let's say into i in
j
and a temporary variable
temp
after that we will declare an array arr
and let's say the size of the array is 8
and the elements of array are
12
let's say 3
1
5
18
and
10
7
and 35
so these are the elements of the array
now we will
display these elements
so we'll
display a message unsorted array as we
know that these area elements are
unsorted so
we will print the message unsorted
with slash n
all right
now
we will
write the for loop in i equal 0
that runs from i 0 to i 8
because you want to print the array
i less than equal to 8 i less than 8
i plus plus
now here we will print the array
arr
i
so one by one all the elements will get
printed
and we'll add the slash t
to add the horizontal space between each
element
all right
now
for space we will
write we can write endl
now we will write the logic for bubble
sort as we know in bubble sort the
swapping is done starting from the first
two elements and if the element on the
left is greater than the element on the
right then the swapping is done
so we'll do that
we'll write a for loop
which runs from i 0 to 8
and i equal 0
i
less than
8
i plus plus
and
the second for loop would be
int
j equals
i plus 1
j less than 8
j plus plus
now i'll explain both of these loops
but before that let us just write the if
condition for swapping
if
a r r
i
is less than
a r
j
oh
i write the opposite of that which i
have to write
let's make it i
yeah if a r of j is less than a r of i
then we'll do the swap so now i'll
explain this part
here when i is at
0
then j is at 0 plus 1 that is at index
1.
so now comparison will take place
between element and index 1 and element
at index 0.
if the right element that is index 1
element is smaller than the left element
that is index zero element then swapping
will take place
and similarly one by one each element is
compared with the next element and it
will proceed till the end of the array
so now here we will write the
swapping logic
we will store the first variable into
the temporary variable
and then we will store the second
variable into array of i
then will again store
into area of j
the value holded by the temporary
variable
all right so this is how swapping is
done
now all we need to do is to just print
the array elements because it
because we have to show the sorted
elements of the array so
we'll first display a message
sorted
elements
all right
and then we'll use slash n as well
now here again we will use the for loop
and
which runs from i 0 to i 8
e less than 8
i plus plus
and now we will print the elements of
the array of sorted array
just to add the horizontal space we can
write slash d
and now
after that
return zero
let's save it and let's hope it will
work
so as we can see this is the unsorted
array 12 3 1 5 18 10 7 35 and this is
our sorted elements of the array 1 3 5 7
10 12 18 35 so as you can see these
elements are sorted
and
using the slash t we have added the
space between each of these elements
all right now let's do another example
so now let's do an example of insertion
sort first of all let's save it
and let's name it as
sort
2
dot cpp
now let's add the head files
hash include iostream
then
write the namespace standard
then we'll start with the main function
in main
now we will
write the variables like
and i int j and
num variable
then the temp variable temporary
variable
and we'll also initialize the array
let's
make it 30 size
now we'll take the input from the user
so
right enter the elements
enter the number of elements first of
all
all right
we'll take the input
as num
and then
we'll ask the user
to enter the
elements
all right
now
using for loop
sorry
using for loop
i
equals to 0
till i less than
num
i plus plus
we will take the input
of the elements of the array one by one
so
num is the size of the array so one by
one all the elements
will the user will enter all the
elements
all right after that
all right now we'll write the code for
insertion sort
please keep in mind in insertion sort
we start by comparing the second element
with the first element if the second
element is smaller than the first
element then we will swap it
after that we will compare the third
element with all the elements that are
before it similarly it goes for the
fourth element and so on
we can see this figure for reference and
now we'll start doing the code
we'll start by writing
the for loop which
starts from 0
till num minus 1.
less than m i plus plus all right after
that
we will store the array in the temporary
variable
once it's done
then we'll write j i minus 1
first of all we have copied the elements
of array to the time variable then we
have set j equals to i minus 1 because
we have to compare it with the previous
element
and
all right
now we'll write the while loop
okay so
temp
is less than a r of
j plus one
now
only j
and for termination j must be greater
than zero
all right let's
make them inside the brackets
all right now
first of all let's write the code then
and i'll explain the part
i have j plus 1
array of j
we will move this element forward
and then we'll write
j minus 1 will decrement it
then
you have to insert the element in this
place
all right
i'll explain this part
in this part we have copied the elements
of array to the temp variable first of
all and then we have set j equals to i
minus 1 because we have to compare it
with one previous element
and
while in while loop we are checking if
the value of element prior to array of j
is more or less
if it is less than removes the element
in order to set it to the right position
using area of j plus 1 equals to temp we
are actually inserting the element in a
proper place
or the right position
we are validating that j remains greater
than equal to 0
so
this is how it's done and now we have to
print the elements
so now we have to print the sorted
element so we will
write the message will display the
message
sorted
elements
and then using the for loop
we will display all the elements one by
one
i plus plus
arr
inside it will write i
and
will add some space
once it's done then
all is left is to write return 0
return 0
now let's save it
once it is saved then now let's check
if it is running fine or not
as we can see enter the number of
elements in the array let's say there
are five elements
right
eight
one
four
nine
two
all right eight one four nine two so
our output is wrong
let's check
uh where it is
i less than equal to
this is the problem
let's save it
and let's check it once more
five
now
eight
five
seven
2
6
8 2 5 6 7
all right now i get it actually we are
checking from the first element so
we have to start with the first index
now let's save it
and try one more time
five
nine
five
eight
2
and let's say 12
2 5 8 9 12. so finally our output is
correct
because of some logical mistakes our
output was getting wrong but now we
finally can see that 2 5 8 9 12 the
elements of the area are finally sorted
and
this is how you can do insertion sort
now after this we'll do another example
all right now let's do an example of
selection sort
let's name it as sort 3
dot cbp
so let's understand the selection
sorting technique one more time in this
technique the smallest element is
fetched by comparing itself with the
rest of the element and is sorted at the
first position of the array
after the first element is positioned
the search for the second element begins
from the rest of the array and is
positioned and the second place
similarly all other elements are
positioned like this
as we can see in the figure
now let's do its practical
implementation
so let's start by adding the header
files
hash include iostream
let me write the using namespace
standard
now we'll start with the main function
all right so first of all we'll declare
some variables like in i
and j
and
num variable
then
a variable p
and a temporary variable temp
and we also need a minimum variable
we'll name it min
and now we will declare the array
let's make it of size 10 and yeah
now
we will display a message saying that
enter the number of elements
all write enter
the number of
elements
all right
now we will take the input
see in num
now
we'll ask them to enter the elements
so we'll write slash n
enter the
elements
all right now again we will use slash n
once it's done now we can take the input
of the array
so we'll start with it int i equal 0
i less than num
i plus plus
and now c in
array arr
index i
so
yeah
now we can take the input from the user
and now we have to do the actual part
that is the selection sort we have to
sort the array
using the selection sort technique
so let's start
we'll write a for loop and i equals
0 i less than num minus 1
i plus plus
inside this loop we will store the value
of the first element of the array
min equals arr of i we are storing the
first
element of array into this min variable
so here we are storing the value now we
have to store the index
so
the p variable which we have declared
and we are storing the
index i to this p variable
all right after that we have to use
another for loop
where the actual comparisons
begins
now we will write
j
equals to i plus one
and
j less than num
j plus plus
now i'll explain you this for loop
in this for loop we are doing i plus 1
because here the comparison will take
place and the comparison will occur with
the preceding elements
so we have to do j equals to i plus 1
now we have to do inside this for loop
we'll use a if condition
so we'll write
if
minimum is greater than array of
j
that if
that is
if any element is smaller than the
minimum element then that particular
element will be set as minimum element
so we'll do that we'll write
min equals
array of i arrive j sorry
and we also
have to change the index so we'll assign
the index of j to the p earlier we have
assigned the index i to p
but if that particular element is
smaller than the minimum element then we
also have to assign the index to p
now all we need to do is to swap
so now let's do the swapping part as
well
all right
so first of all the temporary variable
temp we will assign arr of i
we have to swap error of i and arr of b
because the index j is assigned to p
and we all know how to do the
swapping
of i
now we will
put the value of error of p into error
phi
now the value at temp
goes to error of p so the swiping is
done here
and now we have to just print the sorted
array
so now let's first of all display a
message saying that the sorted elements
are
right slash in
sorted
elements
are
slashing again
now using for loop we will print all
those elements
equals 0
i less than
n
num sorry i plus plus
all right now we will
just print the array
and now in order to give some space
we'll
use the double quotes
now it's done
now return 0 will write
now everything is done now let's check
if it is working or not
it's done by our end so let's save it
and
let's try to run
enter the number of elements okay so
let's add five
now five elements are
eight
one
five
sorry
one
five
three
seven 1 3
5 7 8 as you can see
these are the sorted elements and this
is correct
so this is how we can do the selection
sort
this is our logic behind the selection
sort
you can try this example as well
all right now we'll do an example of
quick sort
so first of all
let's create a new file
and
name it as
sort four dot cpp
now as we know in quick sort follows the
divide and conquer algorithm so let's
have a look at it
as we know in quick sort a pivot element
is selected like
here we have selected 6 as a pivot
element and then the elements which are
smaller than 6 are put on the left side
and elements which are greater than 6
are shifted to the right side and
similarly
same thing is done with the
partitions or the sub arrays
and in the end when we combine we get a
sorted array so now
practical implementation so first of all
we'll start by creating a main function
and before that
we'll add the header files hash include
iostream
and the namespace standard
all right now we'll start with the main
function
inside the main function we will
declare a variable num and another
variable i
and
declare an array arr size let's say 10
now we'll display a message
saying that enter the number of elements
enter the number of elements
all right now
here it is
now we will take the input
from the user
num
now we will display another message
saying that enter the elements
and now we'll use for loop
to take the input from the user
i equal 0 i less than
num
i plus plus
so inside the slope
c in and ar i will
take the input from the user
user enters all the digits or the
elements now we will call a function
quick
and we'll pass the arguments array and
the starting index and the ending index
the starting index would be 0
and ending index would be num minus 1
that is size minus 1.
so this is where we are calling the
quick function
and after that we can
display a message saying that
after sorting
the elements are
and now using for loop again
we can display
the sorted array afterwards
add some space
yes
and
we'll write return 0
so our main function is done
now all we need to do is to make the
quick function
all right so let's create this quick
function
quick
and its data type would be void
quite quick and will pass the
the arguments on the parameters are
array and the starting index and the
ending index
start
hint and
so these are the parameters and inside
this quick function
we'll write the if condition
that is if start of the index is less
than end that is if the array element is
more than 1
then
here we will find the point of division
d
and then there would be recursive calls
for the divided sub arrays
or the partitions
so now
we will make the division point d
and
now we will call
the function divide
and we'll pass
the parameters array and the starting
index and the ending index to this
function as well
so here
d is the division point and by calling
this function we'll find this division
point
after that we will do the recursive call
for the left sub-array and the right
sub-array
so let's do that
quick
array
in starting index
and ending index
but here ending index would be as it is
a sub array as it is the left sub array
so the division point is the point of
division
so the ending index for the left
sub-array would be d minus one
and similarly now again we'll call for
the right sub array
here the starting index would be
d
plus one
and the ending index would be
end
let me explain this part again
the first recursive call would be from
start
to d minus one and the second recursive
call from is from d plus one
to the end
so these are the two sub arrays this is
the right sub array and this one is the
left sub array so d minus one is this
element and d plus 1 is this element
all right now we'll make this divide
function
and we have to make this divide function
above the quick function otherwise it
will show an error or
if you don't want to do that then you
can do the forward declaration but i'll
prefer doing this only
so
it is the data type divide is the name
and now
in
arr as we have passed the starting index
and the
sorry the starting index
and the ending index
all right
now inside this divide function first of
all we will
set a pivot
element
so we'll do that and r
we always we usually select the last
element as pivot element or you can
select the first element as well or any
random element
now
we'll create another variable in index
and
we'll assign it start index
now this variable will keep the track of
elements in the array
starting from all first element and all
these elements
so
now
we'll use a for loop
and now we will do the comparison with
the pivot element so inside the for loop
int i equals 0
sorry int i equals start because we'll
start from the first element so i equal
start
i less than
and we will not use
less than equal to we'll use i less than
n because we don't want to include the
pivot element so that is why we'll use i
less than end and now i plus plus
all right now inside this for loop we
will create
if condition
now in this condition if the array of i
is less than the pivot element then we
will shift it towards the left then
we'll do the swiping
arr i
is less than
pivot
then
temporary variable temp and we all know
how to do the swapping
so we'll do that
arri index
please note that index is storing the
start
and pivot is storing the end
so keep in mind that
now arr
index
this temporary variable
now we will increment this index plus
plus
because this index plus plus will do the
further comparison with pivot
element
so
if
that particular element is smaller than
the pivot element then it will move to
the left side otherwise on the right
side
all right now it's done
now the only thing left is the
positioning of the pivot element
and to do that because we have to find
the partitioning point so we have to
position the pivot element at at its
proper place so for that we'll use the
temporary variable again
and
arr
and index
then
we'll swap it
with index
so here we are done with the swapping
now we have found the partitioning point
so we will return the
index
now the pivot is at its proper position
now all the elements on the left side of
the pivot element are smaller than that
and all the elements on the right side
of it are greater than that
now let's try to save it and run it
i hope it works
there are some errors let's check
all right all right let's do it
and this one is
this one is extra
all right now let's save it and run it
enter the number of elements let's say
we have entered five
not that place
five elements
three
one
nine
five
