factual control with China the statement
of the army Chief really says and I am
in fact quoting from that statement as
far as we are concern we want to go back
to status quo of April 20 today has
capability to carry X number of weapons
but the that's again Civil War army
commanders 7.62 7.62
that so uh majorly this is what the Army
Chief has said that India wants to go
back to that position of pre-april 2020
that was the status quo between India
and China along the line of actual
control and he also goes on to say that
what India is trying to do is to restore
trust how will this be restored that
will be once uh we go ahead and see each
other that is he's probably talking
about that impending meeting of prime
minister Narendra Modi with the premier
of China Xi Jinping an important
statement of the army Chief right after
we are getting news of this
disengagement with the Chinese troops
along the line of actual control and
also how new patrolling agreement has
been reached upon by India and China my
colleague Akash Sharma is with us on the
broadcast for more inputs on the story
Akash that's a very important statement
by the Army Chief especially after this
impending bilateral that prime minister
Narendra Modi will be having with Xi
Jinping at The Brick
Summit right uh so you see GHA first of
all an importantance statement came
yesterday uh you know when the foreign
secretary in fact mentioned it
categorically that how you know we are
we have agreed upon uh you know on
petring points and how this will lead to
the disengagement we know that how after
2020 Galvan Clash we had several
friction points between India and China
on the line of actual control and you
know among these points five out of
seven points in fact were resolved and
buffer zone strategy was in place but as
as far as Zang and CH concern so these
were the two points where we still had
escalations and in fact engagement but
Asos now Army sour are in fact telling
us that as far as this particular
development is concerned so both the
sides have been working and in fact
discussing on uh the petrol points we
have more than five petrol points on
these locations and it has been worked
upon and now we are learning that on
ground it will be implemented uh I mean
you know whatever has been decided it
will be implemented on ground but this
time Army Chief is categorically saying
that Indian army wants to go back to the
2020 position we have some traditional
points where Indian army used to petrol
and this petring was blocked by Chinese
troops similarly when Chinese troops
blocked our petring you know our Javan
also you know erected some sort of tents
and structures and blocked their petring
so from both these sides you know
petring is not happening from last 4 and
a half years and it is not about just
deang and Dem chalk the issue is not
limited to that you know these two
friction points as far as the remaining
points are concerned where we had
disengagement in the earlier years and
where we have buffer zone strategy in
place there also we have several sort of
conditions so as of now Army Chief is
categorically saying that we want to go
back to 2020 positions foreign secretary
did not mention about any sort of
friction point he did not you know
expend on as to uh you know what is
going to be the design of the
disengagement or petring for that matter
but as of now we are expecting some sort
of announce M after the possible meeting
between the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
and president XI jimping and you know it
is expected that on ground design and
implementation will come out very soon
right Akash stay with us in fact we were
not able to play out that entire
reaction of the army Chief when he
speaking about this disengagement
especially at demchuk and deang the
friction points there along the line of
actual control let's listen into what
exactly he said so as far as some
statements have already been given out
so what does it
mean as far as we are concerned we were
looking at that we want to go back to
the status quo of April 2020 Point
number one thereafter we will be looking
at disengagement deescalation noral
normal management of line of actual
control and this normal management of
line actual control will not just stop
there there are phases in that also so
this what I'm saying we it's have been
asked St from April 20th self Angel y
josi was the Army Commander and even
today that remains the same
way so as of now what has happened we
are trying to restore the trust how the
trust will get restored it will get
restored once we are able to see each
other and we are able to convince each
other look the buffer zones which are
there which have been created we are not
creeping and both have to reassure each
other petroleum gives you that kind of
Advantage so that's what is something
which is convincing and as we restore
the trust the other stages will also
follow through
soon I think this is the Diplomat we are
learning that Army Chief pend dedi is
made a big statement after this
particular new patrolling agreement has
been reached along the line of actual
control with China the statement of the
army Chief really says and I am in fact
quoting from that statement as far as we
are concerned we want to go back to
status quo of April 20 today has
capability to carry X number of weapons
but the that's again Civil War army
commanders 7.62 7.62
that so uh majorly this is what the Army

that was the status quo between India
and China along the line of actual

will be once uh we goad head and see

sheing and you know it is expected that
Ong ground design and implementation
will come out very soon right Akash stay
with us in fact we were not able to play
out that entire reaction of the army
Chief when he's speaking about this
disengagement especially at Dem chalk
and they have sung uh the friction
points there along the line of actual
control let's listen into what exactly
he said so as far as some statements
have already been given out so what does
it
mean as far as we are concern we were
looking at that we want to go back to
the status quo of April 2020 Point
number one thereafter we will be looking
at disengagement deescalation noral
normal management of line of actual
control and this normal management of
line actual control will not just stop
there there are phases in that also so
this what I'm saying we it have been our
St from April 20th self Angel W josi was
the Army commander and even today that
remains the same
way so as of now what has happened we
are trying to restore the trust how the
trust will get restored it will get
restored once we are able to see each
other and we are able to convince each
other look the buffer zones which are
there which have been created we are not
creeping and both have to reassure each
other petroleum gives you that kind of
Advantage so that's what is something
which is commencing and as we restore
the trust the other stages will also
follow through
soon I think this is the diplom we are
learning that Army Chief pendra dedi has
made a big statement after this
particular new patrolling agreement has
been reached along the line of actual
control with China the statement of the
army Chief really says and I am in fact
quoting from that statement as far as we
are concerned we want to go back to
status quo of April 20 today has
capability to carry X number of weapons
but the we that's again Civil War army
Commander 7.62 7.62
that so uh majorly this is what the Army
Chief has said that India wants to go
back to that position of pre-april 2020
that was the status quo between India
and China along the line of actual
control and he also goes on to say that
what India is trying to do is to restore
trust how will this be restored that
will be once uh we go ahead and see each
other that is uh he's probably talking
about that impending meeting of prime
minister Narendra Modi with the premier
of China Xi Jinping an important
statement of the army Chief right after
we are getting news of this
disengagement with the Chinese troops
along the line of actual control and
also how new patrolling agreement has
been reached upon by India and China my
colleague Akash Sharma is with us on the
broadcast for more inputs on the story
Akash that's a very important statement
by the Army Chief especially after this
impending bilateral that prime minister
Narendra Modi will be having with Xi
Jinping at The Brick
Summit right uh so you see GHA first of
all an important statement came
yesterday uh you know when the foreign
secretary in fact mentioned it category
Ally that how you know we are we have
agreed upon uh you know on petring
points and how this will lead to the
disengagement we know that how after
2020 Galvan Clash we had several
friction points between India and China
on the line of actual control and you
know among these points five out of
seven points in fact were resolved and
buffer strategy was in place but as as
far as Zang and B are concerned so these
were the two points where we still had
escalations and it's in fact engagement
but as of now Army sours are in fact
telling us that as far as this
particular development is concerned so
both the sides have been working and in
fact discussing on uh the petrol points
we have more than five petrol points on
these locations and it has been worked
upon and now we are learning that on
ground it will be implemented uh I mean
you know whatever has been decided it
will be implemented on ground but this
time Army Chief is categorically saying
that Indian army wants to go back to the
2020 position we have some traditional
points where Indian army used to petrol
and this patrolling was blocked by
Chinese troops similarly when Chinese
troops blocked our petring you know our
Javan also you know erected some sort of
T and structures and block their petring
so from both the sides you know petring
is not happening from last four and a
half years and it is not about just
deang and Dem chalk the issue is not
limited to that you know these two
friction points as far as the remaining
points are concerned where we had
disengagement in the earlier years and
where we have buffone strategy in place
there also we have several sort of
conditions so as of now Army Chief is
categorically saying that we want to go
back to 2020 positions foreign secretary
did not mention about any sort of
friction point he did not you know
expend on as to you know what is going
to be the design of the disengagement or
petring for that matter but as of now we
are expecting some sort of announcement
after the possible meeting between the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and
presidenti she imping and you know it is
expected that on ground design and
implementation will come out very soon
right Akash stay with us in fact we were
not able to play out that entire
reaction of the army Chief when he's
speaking about this disengagement
especially at demchuk and deang the
friction points there along the line of
actual control let's listen into what
exactly he said so as far as uh some
statements have already been given out
so what does it
mean as far as concern we were looking
at that we want to go back to the status
quo of April 2020 Point number one
thereafter we will be looking at
disengagement deescalation noral normal
management of line of actual control and
this normal management of line actual
control will not just stop there there
are phases in that also so this what I'm
saying we it's have been asked St from
April 20th self Angel YK josi was the
Army commander and even today that's
Remains the Same
Way so as of of now what has happened we
are trying to restore the trust how the
trust will get restored it will get
restored once we are able to see each
other and we are able to convince each
other look the buffer zones which are
there which have been created we are not
creeping and both have to reassure each
other petroleum gives you that kind of
Advantage so that's what is something
which is convincing and as they restore
the trust the other stages will also
follow through

7.62

and China along the line of actual
