hey what's up Traders hope you're doing
well in today's video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to install real
test so first of all what is real test
if you haven't seen my recent videos and
email newsletters about real test go and
check them out but basically it is a
multi strategy portfolio level back
testing software so let me break this
down multi strategy means that it can
back test multiple systems in a single
back test so you can mix and match
systems together like you would in a
recipe for example it's probably a bad
example but uh you could have a long
only system and a short only system you
could have a system that's a um mean
reverence system and a system that is a
trend following or momentum system you
could even have two systems trading
different time frames so a daily chart
weekly chart and you could merge them
together uh you could even have systems
that trade different markets so the
Aussie Market the Australian Market or
the Canadian Market or the US market and
you can merge those systems together
multiple currencies Etc obviously
something we cannot do in uh pinescript
so that's why I've been using this
software to develop my stock market
systems now portfolio level means that
we can trade a portfolio of symbols in
our back test so for example I have a
system that trades 20 different stocks
at a time or up to 20 it doesn't always
have 20 positions but it can trade up to
20 Max positions so on a very very busy
day all 20 positions will be filled and
uh yeah I'll have 20 open stocks in my
portfolio we can back test that using
real test another thing we can't do in
pin scripts now real test is a terrible
charting software I'll just say that up
front you wouldn't use real test to
analyze markets with drawing tools that
is something that is very much trading
views strength if you're analyzing price
action you'd want to use trading view
pinescript is unparalleled when it comes
to analyzing price action in a visual
manner for charting when it comes to
back testing multiple systems across
multiple stocks it is very lacking in
that system we can't do that so using
both of these together these two tools
has made me a very very uh what's the
word holistic Trader I use trading view
to analyze markets I use it for my um
handful of discretionary or semi
discretion I'm a rules based Trader but
I do have systems that depend on my
interpretation of price action I use
trading view for those sorts of systems
with real test I have pure mechanical
systems the systems that I trade in real
test are very black and white they're
very green light red light either I have
a trade or I do not have a trade but the
system itself has basically no
discretion in it obviously there's
discretion in developing the system
itself in choosing what conditions the
system uh users and what techniques the
system uses that requires discretion to
decide what to do or how to build your
system but once the system is built real
test spits out my orders every day or
every week or every month whatever time
frame I'm trading and I just press the
buttons it's that simple now building
the system is the hard part obviously
back testing it properly making a robust
system that can stand the test of time
uh but once you have a system that that
fits that criteria uh real test is very
powerful and so in the videos to come
I'll share what I've learned about real
test how I use it in my personal trading
process um but for today's video we've
got to start somewhere let's start with
installing real test and getting the
software running on your computer
because it's not as simple as trading
view trading view you just go to
tradingview.com so before we get started
let me just quickly explain exactly how
real test Works technically so it's a
standalone software it's an application
it's a Windows only application so if
you're going to use this on a Mac or
Linux or any other operating system you
will need a virtual machine to do that
I'm not going to show you guys how to do
that in this video but for those of you
with Windows computers this will run no
problems on um unless you're maybe using
Windows 95 it should work on your
computer one other thing I should
mention up front that I'm not sure I
have in the past videos I've made um and
newsletters I've sent out Is that real
test is a daily chart only back testing
software so if you're an intraday Trader
you're trying to develop intraday
trading systems especially if you're a
currency Trader so you're trading
intraday currencies Forex markets for
example you probably want to stick to
trading view for that just because they
have such a massive amount of intraday
lower time frame data in their platform
basically for free it's included in your
subscription but when it comes to real
test um this software is designed to be
traded end of day now that doesn't mean
that it doesn't take many trades I've
developed systems that take hundreds of
Trades if not thousands of Trades a year
um simply because there are so many
stocks out there so even though it's
trading end of day for example my system
that trades 20 uh positions per day has
a sample size of 30 something thousand
trades over a 20 or 30 year period so
for those of you who are thinking that
trading end of day means less
opportunities that's simply not true
because of how many markets we have to
trade so with all that out of the way
let's get into how to install this
software so I'll leave links in the pin
comment below and in the video
description to real Test's website uh
but it is mhpr trading.com once you're
here you need to go to the free trial
and purchase link if you've never bought
real test before then you do have access
to this 30-day free trial which I
obviously recommend you use you get full
access to the software and there's no
restrictions so you can play around with
it see if you like it or not see if it's
something that you want to commit to
otherwise it's
$389 current Curr for a new license
price that's a one-time payment and you
have access to um lifetime use of the
current version plus all releases and
updates for the next 12 months and you
can also install real test on two
computers at once so I have real test on
my main computer I've uninstalled it for
today's video so that I can reinstall it
with you guys um and show you the steps
but I also have it installed on my
dedicated machine so that when I'm
traveling or I'm just not home uh for
whatever reason I can jump into my
remote computer my remote um dedicated
machine and I can do my trading from
there Norgate data which will get to
later also has a similar feature where
you can have it installed on multiple
computers but there is a limit so you
can't share your license with your mates
your family once your 12 months is up if
you do need access to the latest updates
maybe maren the creator of real test
fixes a bug that you need fixed for your
trading then you might need to purchase
this license extension would which is
159 USD and it adds a year license to
your date so that you can get um updates
for another year now if you click these
links that will take you to the purchase
page uh but if you've never installed
real test before you need to click this
one here download real test installer so
I'll do that right now there we go that
is done so now I've open up my downloads
folder here is the real test installer
let double click that so here we go make
sure to read the uh license agreement
unless you're uh you like to live
dangerously like me and you never read
these and you just accept them um
there's no reason why you can't install
this to the default Drive um if that's
what you want to do for me personally I
like to install this onto my second hard
drive doesn't really matter what type of
drive you install it to as far as I know
um a solid state drive is probably going
to be a little bit quicker but it's
really the the speed of your back test
is probably going to depend more on your
um CPU as far as I know having more RAM
and a better C CPU is probably going to
help speed this software up more so than
where you install it to so I've already
got my folder here from when I
uninstalled real test before recording
uh I guess it didn't delete the folder
so I'm just going to click real test
there and it's going to install into
real test/ real test so click okay click
next folder already exists that's fine
yours won't say that if this is the
first time installing click install and
we're done very quick um I don't want to
read the release notes cuz I read them
recently on the latest update I just
want to run real test so let's click
finish now you won't get this message if
you haven't used your free trial period
you won't get this message now I've
obviously used mine so I get this error
and now I need to enter in my license
information for those of you who can
start your free trial uh you'll get 30
days access to the software without
needing to put in a license for those of
you who have purchased the license this
is where you enter your information so
I'm going to activate my license for the
rest of today's video all right so when
you install the software and open it for
the first time activate your trial this
is the interface you'll be met with it's
a little bit overwhelming at first um
we've got a lot of stuff just crammed in
at the top um so you can see this is a
functional software this isn't made to
look pretty like trading view is uh this
is pure functional back testing software
and that's its strength that's uh what's
great about it we'll learn all of these
um in settings over time in the videos
to come for today you don't need to know
any of this really um we'll get to
running our very first script in a
moment let me close these um my systems
I have open here let's open up the
examples folder so I'm going to scroll
through these and look for a system that
I recognize so let's um let's start with
the doio rayo's all weather um example
system so this is a system that trades
ET ETFs it uh buys spy bonds gold and
commodities and these are the
percentages of the portfolio allocated
to each ETF the reason I chose this
example script is one because it's very
simple there's only a handful of lines
of code here um it's obviously very
different to pinescript it's going to
take some time to learn this we'll get
into that in future videos uh but for
now the important part to pay attention
to is this section here the import
section this is where you import your
historical data so there are a bunch of
options if I go back to the examples
folder and scroll down to import here
are a bunch of example scripts that show
you the methods for importing different
data sources so you can import directly
from an Excel spreadsheet which is
interesting given that um trading view
can export its intraday price action I
wonder I haven't tried this I'm just
speculating but I wonder if it's
possible to import trading views
intraday data into real test to run back
tests on intraday time frames by
tricking it into thinking that each bar
is a daily bar for example I don't know
that's getting a bit outside the scope
of today's video but who knows uh the
point is there are a bunch of different
options for importing the the one I use
the most the one that most professional
Traders use and the data source that is
recommended by real test by the
developer of real test himself uh is
Norgate data we'll get to that in the
next half of today's video how to
install Norgate um it does cost money
and that's why I want to show you guys
this script first because this script
imports from Yahoo which is free so when
you're first um trying out real test
especially during your free trial period
you might want to just play around with
Yahoo it's free data doesn't cost a
scent and all of the syntax is identical
so you can still learn real tests
software and its syntax without having
to pay for data and then you can pay for
the data later down the track when you
feel comfortable uh and ready to move on
and get more advanced with your scripts
now the reason why you need to pay for
data with real test is that when we're
back testing stock market systems free
data isn't going to cut it when it comes
to ETFs you might get away with free
data I haven't played around with many
ETF systems yet so I'm not sure if
that's true but um the the reason why
you need paid data with stocks is
because you need a data source that
accounts for several things that are
unique to stocks such as their listing
status are they delisted are they part
of an index so index constituents and
then you also need to know was the stock
a member of a market index in the past
but is no longer so historical index
constituents we need data that adjusts
for dividends splits it gets quite
complicated and these are things that do
not get managed by a free data source
like Yahoo Yahoo will provide data
sources for currently listed stocks so
you can simulate your back test based on
the current members of the S&P 500 for
example the problem is those members
weren't always the members of the S&P
500 and we need to account for that in
our back test when we're back testing on
a portfolio based system we need to
account for markets that have come into
the index fallen out of the index
markets that used to exist but have now
gone bankrupt markets that we would have
traded 10 20 30 years ago if we were
trading our system but no longer exist
on these free data sources trading view
has the exact same problem trading view
does not provide data for Dlisted stocks
so if a stock goes out of business if a
company goes bankrupt and gets delisted
from the Stock Market trading view does
not provide data for that market anymore
because why would it it's not a back
testing software as such it's a charting
software with back testing sort of tax
on that's why we need dedicated software
like this for things like developing
portfolio based stock market systems but
anyway for those of you who are just
playing around with real test getting
your feet wet stick to Yahoo for now
there's no reason not to so here in data
source we're telling real test to import
from Yahoo these symbols so these are
ETFs we specify a start date an end date
we can just use the latest keyword to
import from this start date all the way
up until the latest you could also
change this to earliest the problem with
doing this is as this comment says DBC
was not listed as an ETF until this date
so if you're trading multiple ETFs for
example you need your start date to be
um the first date of whenever the last
ETF was listed if you were trading the
constituents of the S&P 500 for example
you might be able to set this just to
earliest and then your data source will
include the first possible date and the
last possible date in your historical
data but I'll leave that as it is for
now finally you have a save as this is
your data file so this makes importing
very quick the first time you run this
it will save all of the price data to a
file and then when you run your test it
will import all of the data from that
file and things run a lot quicker than
if you had to import the data every time
you ran your test so to import this data
from Yahoo for free we can simply leave
this as it is and come up to this button
here and click import and now the
software is connecting to Yahoo now it's
importing the historical data from the
five symbols we have listed here now
this is much much slower than using a
paid data source um Norgate data would
have had this done a long time ago but
this import's been running for couple of
minutes now which is a long time to
import five symbols but anyway that's
what happens when you use free trading
resources there we go it is finally done
so now in my settings I'm referencing
the same file we just imported and saved
so now when I run back test this
information comes into play so now we
are starting from the earliest date
included in our data source so by
default this is going to be this date
here because that's when we set our
import date to start from so our back
testing date is this one it's going to
be the earliest included in our data set
and the latest included in our data set
and our bar size is monthly so this
system is going to uh adjust its
position sizing at the end of each month
now I can click test we're done now that
was really really quick let's do that
again
test it's almost instant very cool um so
this system this rid doio system has a
6% rate of return not fantastic uh but
better than the interest rate you get on
a bank balance but the Max draw down
you're almost beating the um Benchmark
which I believe is around
7% okay so was a bit off it's it's about
10% holding spy for the past 30 years
produced about a 10% annual compounded
return however it also endured about a
50s something per draw down during the
2008 financial crisis so you know this
is not a bad system yeah you're cutting
your return almost in half but you're
cutting your draw down over half so this
is the kind of thing billionaires put
put some of their money into to mostly
probably to protect it from inflation
more so than grow their wealth but
anyway this simple system profitable
very easy using free data source if
you're following along then you've
imported your first data set made your
First Data file run your first back test
through the real test system uh we'll go
into more detail in future videos for
now let's just go over uh the summary
report so if I click this and bring this
over this gives us a report of the
system how many trades it took its win
rate its average win average loss whole
bunch of statistical information even a
year by year and month by month break
breakdown of its p&l as a percentage of
the account balance your Max draw down
so this system has a very low Max draw
down here's your Equity curve uh draw
down stats you even have some Monte
Carlo information down here which
simulates um potential outcomes for the
system if Randomness is introduced so
that the black line is our actual system
performance the colored lines of
theoretical potential uh performances if
things was slightly different in
historical data so ideally you want a
system that ends up profitable in all of
its Monte Carlo simulations now so
anyway these are all things that we'll
break down in future videos for now that
concludes the real test version of this
installation guide let's jump over to
Norgate now and I'll show you how to
import paid data including historical
constituents and all of that fun stuff
all right so back on my web browser here
is Norgate data's website again this
will be linked below somewhere in the
comments or um description now Norgate
data does cost money so in order to
create an account we need to come over
to the order form so click on this link
here so you can pay for 6month or 12
month subscription so if you're not sure
if you want to commit to this yet maybe
stick to a six-month but the 12mon is a
little bit cheaper I believe so most of
you will be creating a new account so
let's click this this button
here so now we have to confirm our
access method so gate data Works in
association with supported third party
applications and platforms for us today
we just need to click on real test
that's this option here you also have
Amy broker and you can select multiple
options here if you want to so if you
know what any of these other system um
import systems are feel free to click
them there's no reason not to but for
today's video I'm going to be clicking
real test because that's the only
platform of this list that I use
currently I have used Amy broker in the
past that's a great software as as well
uh but I prefer real test I like its
syntax I find it syntax a bit more
intuitive to learn and the fact that it
can back test multiple systems
simultaneously is obviously a big
advantage and that's why I'm doing this
series obviously I'm a fan of real test
as we come down you need to put in an
email address so this needs to be a real
email address because your um login
credentials will be sent to this email
once you U pay for the data so make sure
to put in a real email address you need
to consent to their privacy policy um
you don't need to receive emails about
Norgate data developments if you don't
want to so you need to click yes on this
if you want to use Norgate but you can
opt out of the um optional emails here
next up you need to select your payment
currency I select AUD because I'm Aussie
but you should select the one that um
you're going to pay in because you'll
pay less fees I'm going to select 12
months I don't have a coupon code now
this is the important part this is where
we select the data that we need
so you click on which one you want to
extend they do have Forex data and
Futures data which is something I
haven't explored yet but I will in
future videos currently I only trade the
US market and the Aussie market so if we
click on US Stocks data here is the list
let me zoom out my browser slightly so
the one that you will need eventually is
platinum it's not cheap it is
$630 a year this is a
recurring payment so you need to pay
this every year to get your back testing
data now the reason we need Platinum is
because Platinum is the
only um option other than Diamond which
includes Dlisted
Securities and historical index
constituents we need both of these
features in our data in order to
simulate our back tests accurately you
also get data all the way back to 1990
which is obviously big advantage in
terms of sample size
and market conditions to test over a lot
has happened since the
19990s you don't need diamond and
Diamond does include the same features
Dlisted Securities so companies that
have gone bankrupt or simply withdrew
from the market or were merged into
other companies or whatever uh we also
have historical index
constituents both of these are suitable
for back testing the main difference
with diamond as far as I know is that
you get data all the way back to 950
which is even more Market condition more
sample size so if you have the money
there's no reason not to go Diamond but
platinum's a great option as well now
you need one of these platinum or
diamond in the US Stock data section in
order to get accurate back testing
results once you have built a system if
you are no longer in the development
process you can get away with the silver
option because you get current end of
day updates and current major exchange
listed Securities so silver is perfect
for live trading so once your system is
built and you've back tested it and
you're happy with it and you're not
tweaking it anymore you can probably get
away with silver which is half the price
less than half the price of platinum and
this is perfect for for um executing
trades but in the back testing process
we need at least Platinum so you want to
click subscribe that will add it to your
cart we don't need OTC stocks I don't
trade OTC Securities but you can add
that on if you want to um now with
Aussie stocks things are slightly
different but again we need at least the
Platinum option we need historical index
constituents and Dlisted Securities so
I'm going to add that as well um I don't
need derivatives so already I'm looking
at U $1600 a year for my data but you
know in the past two months since this
uh year started I've already I'm up
about
$35,000 it trading my systems so it's
just the cost of doing business as a
Trader and um un unfortunately there's
no way around it and Norgate data are
worth every cent because they do a
fantastic job of curating their data
keeping it up to date making sure it's
accurate so that's why it's the
recommended option for real test Norgate
data do a fantastic job of what they do
but it's not cheap so keep that in mind
if you're going to go down this route
you need to have money to make money in
the stock market it's not like crypto on
Forex where you can start with 100 bucks
you'll probably lose it but you can
start with 100 bucks you can't do that
with stock definitely not then we have
um similar deal with Canadian stocks
data you will need Platinum if you're
Canadian a Futures data I've never used
you only have one option there and um
same with Forex data I'll probably
explore Forex data in future videos but
for now we'll stick to us markets and
Aussie markets here you need to fill out
your billing details um agree to the
terms and conditions and then proceed to
payment and once you pay for your
subscription you will get an email with
your login details and then you can come
over to the downloads Tab and you can
download the software that keeps your
data updated on your PC so the real test
can import it and run tests on that
price data so let's do that next click
on Norgate data program installer all
right that's downloaded come to my
download folder double click on the ndu
installer now this is interesting I've
never had this pop up before um but I do
know that this software is legitimate I
got it from a legitimate source so um a
little bit concerning that this pops up
I've never seen this happen before but
the Norgate data updator is completely
legitimate this publisher is legit so
I'm going to click run anyway hopefully
they fix that by the time you download
this uh installer so now again just like
real test you can leave all of these
settings as the default you need to
accept the license agreement um you can
leave this as the default path if you
want to I'm going to change mine to my
um real test application folder in in my
real test folder just so I can keep
everything together but you can leave
this as the default path if you want to
uh real test will automatically find
where you've installed nor gate data or
at least it should so it doesn't matter
where you install it now we also need to
select our database folder now for some
reason not sure why it has some um
requirements some important requirements
so the database folder needs to be
located along a separate path to the
application folder it cannot be located
under program files this has probably
got to do with read uh read write
permissions some of these folders don't
allow you to read and write if they're
in use and things like that um the
database folder cannot contain any other
file so it needs to be installed into
its own unique folder so for this
particular file path I'm going to leave
it as the default I'm just going to
leave it on my C drive because it can't
go in the installation folder for the
software so let's just leave it where it
is Click next now I do want to update
automatically that means every time I
open the software it will automatically
update my um databases that's fine click
next it requires some Microsoft packages
that's fine click install we'll install
everything for you shouldn't take very
long and there we go we are done so now
I can click run Norgate data updat okay
there's a major update to install so let
it do its thing you'll notice that mine
automatically logged into my account
that's probably cuz my my information
was saved on my PC somewhere I did
uninstall this software before doing
this video but it's kept my sub describe
your information I'll show you how to
log into your um account in a moment but
for now these are the databases that I'm
going to import so these will be based
on what you selected with your Norgate
subscription I'm going to leave all of
these ticked and just click okay now
it's uh downloading and extracting all
of my data and updating everything to
the latest historical price data for
each market that will take some time
depending on your internet connection um
it could take a little while um so it's
a good time to go make a coffee let it
do its thing and when you get back it
should be done but for those of you who
are using this for the first time you
will need to log in to your account so
if you come to settings and click login
details this is where you input your
username and your password mine are
already inputed and I can't change them
for some reason um but you will need to
import this from your email so make sure
to um write down what Norgate data send
you it's very old school this software
it doesn't um I don't think it even lets
you change your password you're just
given a randomly generated number as a
password or at least I was and um I just
had to save this in a text file
somewhere anyway once you've logged in
let it update let it do its thing and
I'll show you how to import data into
real test when it's done all right now
that that's done let's open back up real
test and now let's open up a different
example script let's open up clan
House's stocks on the move this is a uh
momentum rotational system developed by
Andreas kenau in his great book stocks
on the move I highly recommend reading
that book if you're a systematic Trader
and you haven't read it already it's
fantastic it's a great manual on really
good practices for momentum trading
systems in particular and systematic
trading in general but anyway this is
what the import section looks like for
Norgate if you're using Norgate instead
of Yahoo you need to specify Norgate as
you see here this requires the Platinum
subscription that's because we're using
the current and past constituents of the
S&P 500 I already exped what that means
we're also including spy that's for the
regime filter so those of you who have
followed my channel for a while will
know that I'm a big fan of regime
filters in this particular system the
S&P 500 ETF the Spy ETF needs to be
above its 200 day moving average in
order for the system to rotate into new
stocks I won't go over the code to this
uh system in today's video this is all
explained in Andreas clenow uh stocks on
the Move book so again read that if you
haven't already it's fantastic so now
we're importing the S&P 500 current and
past historical constituents into the
SPX RTD file we're importing that into
our back test under the settings uh
section here we're importing from 1995
until the latest available data and
we're back testing from 1999 until 2015
that might be when the book was
published I'm not sure why um that date
set to that uh let's change this to lat
hit save and now hit
import now I might need to restart real
test because it's not recognizing that
I'm upgraded to the Platinum
subscription so I'm going to close real
test open up real test again and hit
import there we go now it's working fine
so I'll bring this up a little bit so
you can see what's happening we're
importing
1,00 symbols from the S&P 500 current
and past constituents into this file
this data file that's done and we're
good to go now if I had multiple scripts
referencing the S&P 500 I can reference
this same file and um whenever I run an
import that will update the data for all
of these systems if I'm using the exact
same data file for this particular
Market anyway now that we've imported
that data set I can hit test and we'll
run a back test on this system there we
go as you can see the system is not bad
it beats the real test version of uh
rayo's all weather so I don't know how
accurate that script is to rayo's
official actual system but I assume it's
pretty close if not spot on uh we beat
that system with Andreas Clen House's
system hope you found this interesting
in the next video we'll write our first
script we'll import something we'll do a
little back test I don't know what we'll
do yet but um I've got some ideas a
bunch of my friends recently had kids
I've got four new babies that my uh
friends have had and I've pledged some
money to each of them to invest in the
market until they turn 18 and then they
can access that money when they turn 18
so I'm working on some long-term ETF
systems um that I can use to invest that
money in for them over the next 18 years
maybe we'll look at one of them in the
next video I might start playing around
with some ETF rotational system
something simple even something as
simple as just buying and holding spy
but using some filters to avoid those
nasty draw Downs that come along every
couple of decades what could also be fun
is uh converting some of the trading
view strategy IES I've made into real
test which we'll look at in future
videos as well but anyway that will do
it for today's video I hope you found
this interesting I hope you guys are
excited to check out real test I know
it's very different to pinescript I know
that a lot of you guys probably aren't
interested in this and that's okay I'll
still be doing trading View and
pinescript videos but I do really want
to do a short series on real test
because it's something I've been using a
lot in my own trading I'm loving it it's
producing fantastic results for me and I
want to share um my experience and
anything that I found success with I
want to share that with with you guys
because I enjoy sharing the knowledge
and wisdom and experience that I'm
accumulating that I learn from Traders
much better than me I like to pass it on
to my audience so I hope you guys are
interested in that and excited about
that if not um stay subscribed because
there'll be more Pine script videos to
come soon take care guys and girls good
luck with your trading I love you all
and I'll speak with you soon
goodbye
