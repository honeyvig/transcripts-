in the field of data science statistical
testing is a crucial yet challenging
aspect to master it plays a significant
role in the data analysis process as it
allows researchers and stakeholders to
draw informative and accurate
conclusions from their data statistical
testing is a method of evaluating the
performance of algorithms and models as
well as identifying patterns and Trends
in a data set this method provides
insight and confidence in the accuracy
of the results enabling informed
decision making there are several
statistical tests that can be used in
data science including the t-test Anova
and chi-square test each test has its
unique purpose and is used to answer the
specific question it is therefore
important for data scientists to have a
solid understanding of different type of
test and where to use each one in order
to draw meaningful conclusions from
their data in summary statistical
testing is an essential tool for data
science providing a systematic and
comprehensive approach for exploring and
analyzing data sets it provides insights
confidence and racing in the research
process all of which are crucial for
making informed decisions based on data
however it also requires a deep
understanding of the test and how to
apply them correctly making it a
challenging but rewarding aspect of data
science hey everyone so today we will
get started by types of statistical
testing statistical tests are crucial
tools for drawing meaningful conclusions
from data they allow us to uncover
patterns compare groups essay
associations and make informed decisions
from t-test for comparing means to see
Square test for categorical data and
from correlational test to regression
analysis statistical tests provide a
systematic framework for analyzing
diverse stereotypes these tests enables
to explore relationships identify
significant differences validate
hypothesis and uncover hidden insights
by employing the appropriate statistical
test researchers and analysts can unlock
the power of data unravel complex
relationships and confidently make data
driven decisions various types of
statistical tests are used to analyze
and interpret data in order to make
statistical inferences here are some
types of statistical tests but before we
begin if these are the type of videos
that you would like to watch then hit
the Subscribe button and the bell to get
notified on our future content also
don't forget to like our videos and if
you are one of the aspiring data
scientists looking for online training
and certification program from the past
universities or a professional who Alex
to switch careers with data science by
learning from the best experts then try
giving a shot to Simply large
postgraduate program in data science in
collaboration with Caltech University
the link to the program is in the
description box below and it should
navigate you to the home page where you
can find complete overview of the
program being offered now back to our
statistical tests so let's begin with
the first one
that is t-test
the t-test is a statistical test that
compares the means of two groups to
determine if there is a significant
difference between them it is commonly
used when the data are normally
distributed and the variances are
assumed to be equal the t-test considers
the sample sizes means and variances of
the groups being compared it produces a
t value and a corresponding p-value
where a smaller p-value indicates a
significant difference and the t-test is
valuable for hypothesis testing and
assessing whether the observed
difference between groups is likely due
to chance or represents a real effect
next we have crucial Wallace test the
Crystal Wallace test is a non-parametric
alternative to Anova it is used to
compare the medians of three or more
independent groups The crucial small
stress is a non-parametrical statistical
test used to compare the medians of
three or more independent groups it is
an extension of the Mana whitening your
test for comparing two groups the
crystal ballistas does not assume that
the data are normally distributed making
it suitable for non-normal distributions
it ranks the data across all groups
calculates the test static and generates
a pay value to determine if there are
significant differences among the groups
if the p-value is below a predetermined
significance level it suggests that at
least one group differs significantly
from the others regarding the medians
now the next one will coxson signed a
rank test this non-parametric test is
used to compare paid samples and
repeated measures it assesses whether
there is a significant difference
between two related variables the
wilcoxins signed rank test is a
non-parametrical statistical test used
compare paid or matched samples it is
employed when the data do not meet the
assumptions required for a parametric
test such as paired t-test moving ahead
we have Pearson correlation
Pearson correlation measures the
strength and direction of linear
relationship between two continuous
variables it assesses the degree of
association between them Pearson
correlation is also known as Pearson's
correlation coefficient and it is a
statistical measure that quantifies the
strength and direction of the linear
relationship between two continuous
variables it ranges from -1 to plus 1
where minus 1 represents a perfect
negative correlation and plus one
represents a perfect positive
correlation and 0 indicates no
correlation now moving ahead at the
sixth position we have this pmn rank
correlation this spearman's rank
correlation is a non parametric measure
of correlation that assesses the
monotonic relationship between two
variables it is suitable for variables
that may not have a linear Association
Spearman rank correlation rho is a
non-parametric measure of correlation
that assesses the more newtonic
relationship between two variables it is
used when the variables are measured on
an ordinal or non-linear scale this pm
and correlation coefficient ratings from
-1 to plus 1 with minus 1 indicating a
perfect negative monotonic relationship
and plus one indicating a perfect
positive monotonic relationship and zero
suggesting no monotonic relationship
next on the seventh position we have
linear regression linear regression is
used to model the relationship between a
dependent variable and one or more
independent variables it helps in
understanding the impact of independent
variables on a dependent variable it
assumes a linear relationship width to
find the best fitting line that
minimizes the sum of square differences
between the observed and predicted
values moving ahead we have logistic
regression
logistic regression is a statistical
model that predicts binary or categorial
outcomes based on one or more
independent variables it estimates the
probability of an event occurring by
fitting a logistic function to the data
unlike a linear regression logistic
regression uses a linear combination of
predictors into a probability it
calculates the odds ratio to measure the
impact of each independent variable on
the outcome moving ahead we have Chi
Square test
the g-square test is a statistical test
used to determine if there is a
significant association between category
and variables it compares the observed
frequencies of categorial data and the
expected frequencies under the
assumption of Independence the test
calculates a chi Square statistic and
generates a p-value and if the p-value
is below the chosen significance level
it suggests that there is a significant
association between the variables the J
Square test is commonly used to research
areas such as social sciences market
research and genetics to analyze data
for goodness to examine the independence
between two or more variables next the
10th one on the list is correlational
tests
natural tests are statistical tests used
to measure the strength and direction of
the relation between two continuous
variables the most common correlational
test is the Pearson's correlation
coefficient which assesses linear
relationships it ranges from -1 to plus
1 where minus 1 indicates a perfect
negative correlation and plus one
indicates a perfect positive correlation
and 0 indicates no correlation other
correlational tests include spearman's
rank correlation coefficient for
assessing monotonic relationships and
candles rank correlation coefficient for
measuring the strength of association
between the variables correlation plus
help identify the degree and nature of
the relationship between variables
aiding and understanding patterns and
making informal decisions
moving ahead to the 11th position we
have Anova test
Anova or analysis of variance is a
stress of three or more groups or
treatments it determines if there are
significant differences among the group
means Anova assesses the variation
within and between groups by calculating
the f-static and generating a P value if
the p-value is below the chosen
significance level it suggests that at
least one group's mean differs
significantly from the others if various
Fields including psychology biology and
businesses Anova is widely used to
analyze experimental or observational
data with multiple groups it helps
uncover differences and understand the
impact of different treatments or
factors on the response variable next we
have time series analysis
time series analysis is a statistical
technique used to analyze and model data
that is collected over time and at
regular events it focuses on
understanding patterns Trends and
dependencies within the time series data
the analysis involves exploring the
temporal structure identifying
seasonality detecting Trends and exam
mining autocorrelation time series model
Rima that is auto regressive integrated
moving average and exponential smoothing
are used to forecast future values based
on historical patterns time series
analysis is widely employed in various
domains including Finance economics
meteorology and stock market analysis to
make predictions identify anomalies and
gain insights from time dependent data
13th one
survival analysis survival analysis is a
statistical method used to analyze
time-to-time event data where the focus
is on the iteration until a specific
event occurs it is commonly applied in
medical research epidemiology and social
sciences to study survival times such as
time to death relapse of failure
survival analysis is used to estimate
the survival probability over time a log
rank test to compare survival curves
between groups and Cox proportional
hazards regression to assess the effect
of co-varities on Survival this analysis
accounts for censoring which occurs when
some individuals do not experience the
event by the end of the study providing
valuable insights into the probability
and timing of events of interest and
