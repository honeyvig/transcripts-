hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply done in today's video we're
going to be learning all about point
essentially but before we begin if you
haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update so now without any further
delay let's begin
this session will help you to understand
what pointers in c is
next pointer declaration
later let's understand the pointer to an
array and followed by a pointer to
function and finally a pointer to
pointer
now let's get started with what a
pointer in c is
a pointer is a variable that holds the
address of another variable to be
executed which can be of data type int
care array etc pointers are used so that
we can easily access the memory location
and it reduces the storage space
pointers also help us to increase the
speed of a program's execution
let's look at the example
int asterisk p where p is a pointer
variable holding address of another
variable of type integer
similarly a pointer variable can hold
the address of a variable type cad float
array etc
now let's look at the pointer
declaration
we have data type followed by asterisk
symbol and name of a pointer variable
to assign a variable to a pointer we use
ampersand symbol so for example let's
declare a variable of type int after
that let's declare a pointer variable
that is p and then a variable a is
assigned to a point of variable p
so this means that a pointer is holding
the address of a variable type in
now let's look at the diagram and
understand how pointers work in c
language
so basically when we declare a variable
memories are located and the value of a
variable is stored in that memory at
some address so in this example let's
consider the address to be 2000
similarly when a pointer is declared
memory spaces are located at address
thousand and the value stored in that
memory is the address of a variable a
now let's execute a program using
pointers
so in this particular program we have
assigned a variable a to a pointer
variable p
so now p is holding the address of va
and we are trying to print the edges of
pointer variable p and the address of a
variable e let's run it
as you can see the output the pointer
variable p holding the address of a
variable a is similar to the address of
a variable a holding a value 5.
all right
up next we have a c pointer to an array
an array is a collection of homogeneous
elements having same name and type c
uses a pointer to an array to reduce the
memory space of the program code
in a pointer to an array the address of
the first element of an array is
assigned to the point of variable
let's consider the below example
where we have declared and initialize
the array of elements and then the first
element of an array is assigned to the
point of variable p
once the base address is assigned the
other elements of an array can be easily
accessible
suppose the array elements are 5 10 15
20 and 25
and they are stored adjacent in the
memory
then the memory space is allocated to
the point of variable at some address
and it holds the address of the first
element
then by incrementing the pointer
variable by 1 the address of the next
element of an array will be stored in
the pointer p
considering the below example so once
the pointer is incremented by 1 the
address 1 0 0 1 will be stored in the
pointer p
now let's look at the example program
using a pointer to array
choose from over 300 in demand skills
and get access to 1 000 plus hours of

description to know more
as you can see from this program we will
fetch the address of an array element
so for that we have assigned a variable
a to the pointer p
and with the help of for loop
we can access the address of the next
element by incrementing the point of
variable p
so now let's run the program and look at
the output
as you can see we got the address of all
the elements in the array
now that we know pointer to array in c
language let's move ahead and understand
pointer to function in c
as we all know the function is a set of
statements that perform a certain task
to generate an output
syntax to declare a pointer to a
function is return type point of
variable followed by list of arguments
to understand a little more about
pointers to function let's run a program
so in this particular program we have a
print function
in which we are performing addition
operation
and we are trying to get the address of
a function by assigning the function
name to the pointer variable
so this pointer to a function must
accept two integer basically it's
holding the address of a function print
now let's run it
so successfully we got an output using a
pointer to a function
we got the value of a and b is five and
three so the sum is eight and the point
of variable p holding address of a
function is
four one nine and seven eight which is
similar to the address of a function
let's now look at the pointer to pointer
pointer to pointer is nothing but a
pointer variable holds the address of
another point of variable for example
first we have declared the integer
pointer variable p and in the second
declaration we have ptr which holds the
address of another integer point of
variable p
let's understand better by looking at
the diagram
so here variable a is holding a value 5
at the address 2009
and the pointer variable p is holding
the address of a variable e
another pointer variable ptr is holding
the address to 1000 of the integer point
of variable p
hope you got a clear idea of how pointer
to pointer in c works
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the pointers in c i hope
this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
