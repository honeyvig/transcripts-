this is dr. Marjorie from team MDS
conquer let's have a short discussion on
anti-malarial drugs so this is a
pictorial representation of lifecycle of
malarial parasite first this malarial
parasite enters into the liver where it
has a a created through scientic stage
and this pre erythrocyte ik stage is the
primary developmental stage where it is
responsible for the cause of malaria
then from here it enters into the RBC
where it can go into edit through cyclic
stage then afterward it releases the
gametes which are carried out from our
blood vessel by female Anopheles
mosquito which is responsible for
transmission of malaria then this gamuts
will form a - I goat undergoes
maturation and release the sporozoite
and again this parasite will enter into
the blood vessel from blood vessel into
the liver so this is the life cycle and
here you can see an other stage that is
exerted through psychic stage in this
stage this quiz ins will remind dormant
in the liver so this is the life cycle
and this is very important point that is
x-ray through psychic stage is absent in
Plasmodium falciparum hence we there are
no relapses in the Plasmodium falciparum
this is the classification of drugs
based on the life cycle they are primary
tissues keys on decides where they will
kill us cousins in the liver and mostly
used for casual prophylaxis and here the
mnemonic is p3 that is proven in
primaquine
and pyrimethamine the second category is
eggs
erythrocyte excuse on decides where they
will crease key zones in the blood and
mostly used for clinical cure a
suppressive prophylaxis and these are
divided into fast acting's erythrocyte
excuse on the sides and slow acting and
these these drugs are the fast-acting
squeeze on the sides and these are the
snow acting squeeze on the sides then if
you go into the x-ray through sight
excuse on the sides they will kill x-ray
through sciatic forms and use for the
radical cure and here the example thing
is primaquine whereas if you go into
this
Ron decides argumento site they will
kill the gamete and prevent the
transmission these are only for class
podium events or plus Plasmodium vivax
plasmodium falciparum
so for Plasmodium vivax it is
chloroquine my parkland and quinine
whereas for Plasmodium vivax and class
podium falciparum combined the drugs are
profiled by pyrimethamine prema queen ID
artemisinin so coming to the most
important drug that is chloroquine this
chloroquine will have a largest volume
distribution and it also prevents
polymerization of heme - Hema join this
is the drug of choice for non falciparum
malaria and also chloroquine sensitive
Plasmodium falciparum and this is a
erythrocyte excuse on this side and uses
you can remember the mnemonic red leaf
Mahatma Gandhi that is our fairy metal
arthritis efore extra intestinal
amoebiasis differ discoid lupus
erythematosus alpha lepre reaction i for
infectious mononucleosis p 4 photogenic
reactions and for malaria energy for
Giardia so these are the uses of
chlorophyll and if you go into the drug
of choice this is very safe drug to be
used in the pregnant women and adverse
effects include peripheral neuropathy
hypotension myocardial depression toxic
psychosis and this is very important
that is bull's-eye maculopathy which is
caused because of prolonged the usage of
this chloroquine and this is nothing but
blindness due to retinal damage then
coming to the quinine this quinine is
the drug of choice for chloroquine
resistant Plasmodium falciparum and this
quinine plus doxycycline or clindamycin
will make decrease in the duration that
means it will reduce the duration of the
therapy when they are combined and this
is also a safe drug to be used in
pregnancy adverse effects include
hypoglycemia
hence hypo go
Seema's cause we have to make the
patient to take five person that means
we have to give it give IV this 5%
dextrose when we are giving the Queen I
then GI distress vertigo and blurred
vision and it Keita can also causes
hemolysis in g6pd deficiency patients
then coming to the mefloquine this
mefloquine also used in the chloroquine
resistance Pal falciparum malaria and
this can be used both for treatment and
also for the prophylaxis and mostly
effect as a single dose adverse effects
include cardiac disturbances psychosis
and seizes and this you have to remember
that my flocking when used with hallo
fan terrine or queen i will causes the
prolongation of QT interval hence it is
not suggested to be used then coming to
the pre mark 1 this primaquine will form
the redox compounds and this has very
uses that means it is used as a pre
erythrocyte excuse on the side x-ray
through sciatic see kiss on the side and
gamut aside and used in the radical cure
and this cannot be used in the pregnancy
and it can cause a Smitham with
hemoglobin II Nia and hemolysis in g6pd
deficiency patients and you can remember
in the life cycle that foul this
Plasmodium falciparum will have no x-ray
through sciatic stage
hence this primaquine has no role in
this falciparum malaria or a radical
cure and then coming to anti folate
drugs there are for antipholus drugs
pyrimethamine pro granny
sulfur dachshund and Dobson this probe
probe when a is a pro drug and this
cyclo panel is an active drug and this
pyrimethamine and cro panel both will
inhibit the DHF
arrays whereas alpha toxin plus
pyrimethamine
causes sequence shear blockade so these
are the slow acting blood skis on the
sides and when you combine this probe
man'll with Auto vakul this will have an
effect that means it can be used both in
treatment
and also chemo prophylaxis for
chloroquine resistant malaria then
coming to the other drug at avec wound
here it is rapidly acting blood skis on
the side and because and because of this
it causes collapse of the parasites
membrane other than this malaria it can
be used in Nemo sisters pneumonia and
also used in Toxoplasma infections
coming to the artemisinin derivatives
the these are the derive ideas that is
oddly muhsinun die Hydra artemisinin
artesunate RT method and RT ether and in
this in these derivatives this artist
need will have a short half-life and
these other drugs will be obtained from
a Chinese herb which is called as
Artemisia annua and this is a faster
starting drugs and highly active free
radicals and can be used in very serious
forms of malaria like cerebral malaria
and also multi drug-resistant malaria
and these are not used in a chemo
prophylaxis because it may causes QT
prolonged prolongation on ECC then
coming to hallo fans dream this halluf
Antron has a erratic oral
bioavailability and it can cause his
cardio tax toxicity and this cardio
toxicity can be increased when he use
with my flow quince and hence it cannot
be used in the chemo prophylaxis and it
also has a multi drug-resistant malaria
usage then when you come to the
lumefantrine if this can be always used
with the RT meter and this absorption of
this lumefantrine
increases with fatty food and these are
the list of fast-acting erythrocyte
excuse on this idle drugs they are given
by mnemonic Mac har that is my flow
Queen Ottawa Kuan chloroquine hallo
pantry Artemis names arrests that is
quinine so that's all guys these are the
very very important points regarding
auntie

love learning with em Riyaz conquer
