the execution of numerous tasks or
activities simultaneously is known as
multitasking
the windows operating system is also a
good example of multitasking since it
can execute many processes
simultaneously such as google chrome
notepad ms office and so on
the operating system uses a notion known
as process to run all of these programs
simultaneously
and on that note hey everyone i am weber
khandelwal and i welcome you all to
simply learn creative channel today we
will be going over the concepts such as
threads
and multi-threading
but first let me remind you that we have
our daily updates on

so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin our session with the
discussion on what a thread is
then we will have a brief discussion on
the topic multi-threading
following that we will discuss the
thread life cycle and its various
features
finally we will end up this session with
a demo explaining
a single thread model and a
multi-threading model
so without any further ado let's get
started
with the discussion on what a thread
class is
first
a thread is defined as a program
operating root
that is every thread creates its own
distinct control flow
next a threading reduces cpu cycle waste
and it also improves a program's
efficiency
threads are created using a thread class
which is
lets you specify a thread's precedence
and it also displays a current status of
the thread
next let's go over a few pointers on
multi-threading
but first let's understand what a single
threaded model is
every program has a one thread that
performs the logic of a program by
default and this thread is known as a
main thread
hence every program or application is a
single threaded by default
but there is a disadvantage to these
single threaded architectures
the single thread executes all of the
processes in a program synchronously
that is one after the other as a result
the second process needs to wait until
the first process completes its
execution
so the second process will take longer
to process
but to overcome this disadvantage we
have multi-threading
multi-threading refers to the use of
many threads
inside a single process
each thread here serves a separate
function
so the main advantage of multi-threading
is
that it operates concurrently meaning
numerous jobs may be executed
simultaneously
finally a multi-threading also maximizes
the cpu's resource consumption
next let's discuss threads life cycle
typically a thread's life cycle begins
with the creation of an instance
of the system dot threading
and a thread class
and it terminates when the thread is
stopped or it finished its execution
now a thread's life cycle has four
states
the unstarted state
a ready state
the not runnable state
and the dead state
let's go over them
one by one
first is an unstarted state
it occurs when a thread object is
created but the threat method is not
invoked
next we have a ready state
in this state
the thread is ready to execute but it's
still awaiting cpu cycle
then we have a not runnable state
when a thread is not executable
because
either the sleep method has been invoked
or the weight method as has been
involved
or the input activities
are causing a bottleneck
then
at last we have the dead state
it is the state in which threats
execution is
either completed or aborted
now that we have thoroughly discussed
the thread and their life cycles
we have also discussed a single threaded
model and a multi-threaded model
so now let's implement these models in a
visual studio code
let me move to my visual studio code

so let's start
with some basic using commands so using
system
then we will have
using
system
dot
threading
then we will have our namespace
with the name as
thread
demo
now
let's have a class
as public
class
main thread
one
now in this thread we will have a static
method
so
public
static
void
th rd
1
this will be a thread name
let's write code in this
function
so we will have a for loop
and
t is equals to zero
then t is less than equals to
10
then we will have t plus
then we will have a console
dot
write line
thread
one
is
then we will
place
a specifier
input
so what these
curly braces
zero will do is it will replace the zero
curly braces zero with the t
but
when the value of
this t is equals to five then this
method must go sleep for six seconds and
after six second it should resume its
working so to do that we will have if
statement
and we will have t is equals to equal to
five
then for the query basis we will have
a thread
dot
sleep
and we will have 6000
now let's create another thread
so we will have another function as
public static
void
phrd 2
this will also print numbers from 0 to
10
so for loop
and
p
is equals to 0
p
less than equals to 10
and p
plus plus
i will have
console
dot
write line
thread
2
is
comma
e
now let's write
our main class
so for that we will go for the public
class
and
main thread
two
then
in this
we will have
static
public
void
main
then
we will call our starting methods
so
main
thread
one
dot
thread
one
then
we will again call man third one dot
thread
two
now
let's save this
and run this program
but first let me explain what this code
does so that so here what will happen is
first this thread one will be executed
now when t
this folder will cycle t so from 0 to it
will go to 9
but when t reaches 5 this if statement
will relaunch and this will let
let go this thread to sleep for six
seconds the six thousand represents six
seconds
now
while these six seconds are over this
thread two is still in the waiting
process
so this whole for loop will be on sleep
for six seconds after the six second
this thread will again run so then it
will start printing out
six
seven
eight nine
and so on and 10
then this thread 2 will be
started and then this will go from 0 to
10
straight up it will not go to slip
because this thread doesn't have this
sleep function
now this is what a good example of
single threaded
process now let's run this
now as you can see it has already
printed from zero to five now it's on
weight
then
after six seconds it printed out the
rest of this thread one then thread two
now
let's write the code for the
multi-threading
let's kill this
and let's delete
everything
now
let's create
let's have a public
class
main
thread
then we will have a static method one
so public
static
void
thread
one
then in this we will print numbers from
zero to ten
so four
and
x is equals to 0
then x
less than equals to 10
then x plus plus
we will write
console
dot
right
line
thread
one
is
co
comma
x
now when the value of r
x is not equal is equals to 5 then this
method should go to sleep for 6 seconds
so
we will have again if x is equal to
equals to 5
then at that point this if statement
will send the thread
dot sleep
for six thousand
now
let's write another set static function
i forgot to add space here
yeah
so now we will have
public
static
void
thread two
then we will have
a for loop
which will again print numbers from 0 to
10
so end
y is equals to 0
y less than equals to 10
and y plus plus
this will also have
console
dot
right
line
then we will have
thread 2
is
0
comma y
now
let's write a main method
so we will have static
public
void
main
now we will be creating and initializing
these threads
so first we will have thread
as
t1
equals to
new
then third
for dhrd1
then we will have another thread
t2
equals to
new
thread
for dhrd2
now we will start each of these threads
so t1 dot start
and
t2 dot
start
here what we are doing is we are
creating and initializing two threads t1
and t2
now using this thread class
now using t1 and t2 start
we are basically starting the execution
of both of the thirds now the both of
the threads are running simultaneously
what it will do is the processing of t2
will not depend on the processing of t1
like in a single thread and model
let's see how it will work let's run
this
now as you can see it has run thread 1
from 0 to 5 then it holded and then it
goes to 0
thread 2
then it finished and after six seconds
this thread one is finished
this is the prime example for a
multi-threading function where
a thread one was started
when it went to sleep after this six
website x equals to five
it went for sleep for six seconds
after
since it went to sleep a thread two
which was already running it started
work
printing out its result so it went out
its results up to 10.
by the time it finished this third one
was also back
so now it was starting running then it
finished its process and then the whole
both of the threads stopped running
and this was all for today's session
