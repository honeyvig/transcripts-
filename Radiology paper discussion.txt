hi friends this is doctor Srikant from
team MDS conquer I'll be discussing
about radiology few mcq so before going
into the discussion make sure you finish
this example okay so this exam is
available in your radiology folder or
radiology folder the topics are
radiation physics radiation biology and
the principles of joven clay okay so the
questions will be on these areas coming
to the question number one
okay the question number one is about
the half value layer okay half value
layer is nothing but okay it is it is
this layer okay it is the substance or
the thickness of the substance which
will reduce the intensity by fifty
percent is okay so you can see so the
thickness of the substance which reduces
the intensity by fifty percent is or
which reduces the number of photons by
half or 50% is is called as half value
layer okay so that's about the first
question so coming to the second
question this is the most commonly asked
question the question is related to the
penetration power okay so if you go in
detail into the sequence of the
penetration power the penetration power
will be leashed for alpha rays followed
by beta rays followed by gamma rays okay
and finally the highest will be for the
new dogface okay so in this question
they have asked the maximum penetration
among the following is same in so among
the options the maximum penetration is
for gamma rays okay so that's about the
second question so coming to the
question number three the darkness of
the radiograph x-ray depends upon all of
the following just simple elimination
based question the answer is angulation
of the cone okay so angulation of the
cone does not have any relationship
between the the darkness of the
dressed or any of these characteristic
features of a radiograph okay
so moving to the next question that is
question number four when the time of
the exposure is doubled okay so what
happens okay the best option among the
list is the number of photons generated
is doubled and a beautiful explanation
was given in the explanation part you
can just have a look okay it's a very
simple explanation so going to the
question number five the quantity of an
x-ray can be measured by can be
increased by Z is a question so before
going into that of course it is
discussed already on the group about the
quantity and the quality okay so coming
to the quantity so the quantity refers
to the number of x-ray photons in the
beam okay as the number of photons
increases the intensity of that x-ray
increases any factors that affects the
number of photons in the beam influences
the quantity so the quantity can be
affected by the current that is the tube
current and the filters that are used in
it and the material the target material
also has some influence if there is any
change in the kVp that also has an
influence change in the wave form and
change in the distance from the tube so
all these factors are going to affect
the quantity of x-rays and of course the
quantity of x-rays refers to the number
of x-ray photons in the beam coming to
the quality the quality is a term that
refers to the overall energy of the beam
as the x-ray beam is polygenic any
factors that increases or decreases the
average energy of the together energy to
all the energy of all the photons will
affects the beam quality so what are
they
so there are few factors which are going
to affect them directly one is change in
the kVp change in the material of the
target that is based upon the atomic
number change in the filters and the
type of the wave form all these factors
are going to fit so if you go into the
question number five of the quality
sorry the quantity of x-ray can be
increased
the answer is all of them coming to the
question number six is about rotating a
node okay so I was already discussed
yesterday in your group you can just go
back and have a look that the methods
there are few methods of dispensing the
heat from the focal spot so out of which
rotating a node is one method so the
course sixth question the answer is C
coming to the seventh question it's a
direct question related to the your your
nota me of your x-rays x-ray tube okay
so to the following is a false statement
if you see the option a tungsten target
is set in the copper block yes it's
right and dental x-ray tube is self
replicated yes of course it's also right
but if you see the option C filters
reduces the exposure time it is no way
related okay and if you see option D the
grid reduces the secondary radiations
reaching the film yes of course it's
just right statement so that wrong
statement in question number seven is C
question number eight is a direct
question about the properties of x-rays
you can check those in your PP books -
is not a property of x-ray collimation
is not a property of x-ray it's a factor
by which you can reduce the size of the
exit but it's not a property that is
related to that is question number nine
is a very sweet and a direct pick that
is x-rays are a type of electromagnetic
radiation stands that you see so
question number ten was already
discussed on the group the size of
actual focal spot is one into three
millimeters so the few things that you
need to add from the textbook so these
are the this pick was taken directly
from your PP books which is returned
notes from white and Pharaoh so if you
see the points to be the points to be
noted about this focal spot it is the
area on the target to which the focusing
cusps of course you know that focusing
cusps is made up of molybdenum directing
the exterior directing the electrons
which the x-rays are produced so it's
it's a place where the electrons are
being directed and if you see this point
that is increasing
sharpness of the image is indirectly
okay it's indirectly proportional to the
size of the focal spot means when you
have a smaller focal spot the sharpness
will be more to take this advantage
smaller focal spots to produce a larger
target area there is an inclination we
made an inclination how much is the
inclination okay so this is the target
inclination is I got a most commonly
asked question that is 20 degrees okay
so this is a most commonly asked
question so next verse is the actual
focal spot is one into three millimeters
which is a rectangle which is a
rectangle in shape okay whereas your
effective is a square in shape that is 1
into 1 inch other methods to dispense
the heat from small focal spot okay as
already we encountered a question is is
a rotating anode so rotating an
irregularly you have a stationary anode
where you will have a focal spot means
focal spot will be at one position in
the if the diode is stationary if a node
doesn't move that that spot is called as
focal spot if the anode is moving then
the focal spot will be converted into a
focal okay so the last two points you
can add a node more often in an
intraoral radiographs you will use a
stationary anode with the legs exposure
whereas in the extra world you will use
a rotating anode with increasing the
next motion okay so all these points are
very very important please do make a
note of this okay so that's about the
question number 10 the size of actual
focal spot is 1 into 3 millimeters come
into the question number 11 okay the
size of the focal spot influences the
definition of the radiograph okay it
helps in identifying the sharpness of
the definition of the reverse the
question number 11 the answer is in
coming to the question number 12 okay
question number 12 is an example of an
isotope that is predominantly data that
is predominantly a pea diameter
okay so easy way to remember us you can
easily remember them as please sorry
yeah okay so with this you can remember
where T stands for
p32 it's a B diameter but as s R stands
for SR 94 e stands for a Sur 90 and by
the R stands for by are 90 okay so these
are the three examples for the B
diameters okay question about the old
answer is B okay so next moves to the
next question that is question number 20
a beta sorry a film batch is a type of
okay it's very simple a beautiful
explanation was given just you can go
through the explanation I hope you see
this type of badge that is being carried
by most of the pieces of Radiology okay
so this is a film badge okay which is
nothing but a dosimeter which helps in
counting the exposure for that
particular individual okay so next
course is the question number 14 so
x-rays were discovered on number eight
okay you can see number eight is
regularly celebrated as a radiology day
okay so number eight 1895 is the answer
for this okay next goes to the question
number 15 the question number 15 okay
don't get confused basically I know that
I know the papers it was ideology so
don't get confused cathode is negatively
charged
whereas cat ion is positively charged
okay so don't get confused about cathode
and cation cathode is a negatively
charged so 15 question the answer is a
whereas cation is a positive charge okay
cation is a positive charge cathode is a
negative charge so next goes to the
question number 16 okay question number
16 basically I don't want to go very
deep into this and I hope most of you
are very good at this so one is about
the cathode okay so one is about the
cathode and second one is about the
anode okay and if you see this this is a
tungsten filament which is embedded in
the focusing cursor and I hope you know
the focusing cause this focusing kospi
is made up of molybdenum
this cathode is made up of tungsten this
tungsten this is more pure
when he goes to the anode this is called
as focal spot the spot where the
electrons are being heated and this is
also the target is also made up of
tungsten okay whereas it is embed in the
case of copper stem all the reasons why
we have used molybdenum why we have used
tungsten why we have used coppiced and
everything but discussed in the group
clearly so please do go back just have a
look all these are very very important
so basically anode and cathode both are
made up of tungsten but anode but
cathode is is made up of tungsten but it
is kept in the focusing curse which is
made up of molybdenum and anode is made
up of tungsten which is kept in the
copper stone okay so if you see the
question number 16 I think the better
option can be tungsten and tungsten or
tungsten molybdenum comma tungsten in
the copper okay so the better option
that you have to go for for the 16th
question the answer is B okay 17
question was discussed perfectly with a
with a video on your group yesterday so
just go back and just have a look that
is more than sufficient for this and
coming to the 18th question the K VP at
which the K shells as its out the
electron is 70 K V P coming to the
question number 19 is an interesting
question during the productions of
x-rays how much amount of electron
energy is converted into heat okay so
out of 100 percent is out of hundred
percent is okay one percentage is used
for production of x rays whereas the
rest 99 percent is is left in the form
of heat okay the answer is 99 percentage
okay so next course is the penetration
power of an x-ray is determined by
kilowatts K V P that is xx question the
answer is C coming to the next one that
is 21st question okay the most common
cause for the x-ray tube failure in the
production of x rays the most common
cause for the failure of x-ray tube is
the loss of filament of the failure of
the filament is the most common cause
okay so next comes is a twenty second
question okay twenty second question you
can just
look over the question this is a known
thing okay and these rays are a type of
soft x-rays and these are soft x-rays
which has a wavelength of two angstroms
okay and if you want you can add other
note that is about strace
these are rays which are produced from
the x-ray tube which are produced from
the x-ray tube apart from the focal spot
okay
so regularly most of the Rays will be
from the focal spot so there will be few
rays which will are produced other than
the focal spot those rays are called as
straightest so please do add a note
about this and add a note about this
these two statements are very very
important so next comes is the question
number 23 okay so question number 23 the
effect of short exposure okay on the on
the contrast of the film
okay the effect of short exposure on the
contrast of the film is the decrease the
contrast okay short exposure is going to
decrease the contrast an explanation is
given just go through the explanation
you'll have a better idea
coming to the twenty fourth question the
twenty fourth question is about the
inherent characteristic features of a
regular x-ray film that is they provide
the details okay they provide the
density they provide the contrast so all
the difference between what is density
what is sharpness what is contrast and
all these are clearly given you just go
through the synopsis that is more than
sufficient coming to the next question
that is 25 question the density of the
dental x-rays is the best answer will be
0.25 to 2.5 so among the options you
need to go for option in the next verse
is 26th question okay the 26th question
is about the most things in the cells
which are stable to radiation
the answer is nucleic acid so among the
nucleic acid it is the DNA if you see
the damaged
of the DNA by the radiation there will
be break of one
both the stands of the DNA the
cross-linking of the DNA strand within
the helix will occur okay and there will
be there will be change of the loss of
the bases that are present in the DNA
and there will be disturbance of the
hydrogen bond between the two strands of
the DNA so these are the biochemical or
molecular changes that occurs during the
radiation on the nucleic acid okay so
next comes is a very very important area
to be noted so these are the direct
things which are taken from your PP
books make a note these are very very
important so don't get confused see the
question number 27 which of the
following has high sub debility to
radiation-induced cards no so make a
note these two tables are a bit
confusing one is inducing carcinoma so
how well they induce the carcinoma in
the or cons okay it is high high chances
of inducing carcinoma intermediate and
low okay so and the second table is
about their reaction to the radiation
reaction to the radiation reaction to
the radiation causing carcinoma is this
one and just reaction to the radiation
is high sorry
high intermediate and low and I hope
you're very very clear about this so
don't get confused whether they're
asking radiation induced carcinoma or
whether they're asking just radio
sensitivity you just check that and you
go according to the options so if you
see the 27 question which of the
following has high chances of getting
radiation induced carcinoma
the answer is gladder in that options
you can see the question so the rest of
the options are the bone surface okay
salivary glands and skin they are low
this is moderate so compared to these
three options this is the best option
then the twentieth question which of the
following has high radio sensitivity
okay the high radio sensitive answer is
mucous membrane the rest of the options
are one is muscle one is optic lens
another one is scenario and so compared
to three is three options this is the
highest one I hope you're very clear
with question number 27 and question
number 28 so next verse is the first
complication after the radio therapy is
inflammation of the mucous or the mucus
layer 29
the answer is coming to the next
question the most sensitive face in the
cell division is okay so anyway we are
going to learn about the cycles of the
cell in detail when we are taking this
general embryology of gentle histology
part but make a note this is the
sequence that you have to make and also
just please do add this to your gnosis
and the most important thing is the most
sensitive the most radio responsive is G
2 and M phase V 2 and M phase are more
radio responsive and the least radio
responsive is in the late s phase okay
so these two statements are very very
important that you have to make a note
so the most radio responsive face in the
cell cycle is G 2 2 G 2 and M whereas
the least radio response of phase is S
phase okay that is the latest race okay
so next goes is which are the following
31 question which of the following is
not a capable of replication if it's
very simple basic question the answer is
neuron ok neuron they don't have the
capability the good capability of a
replication or a regeneration
okay the next comes is low threshold
radiations bill causes all in less than
accept ok so the answer is inflammation
of the mucosa mucositis I mean we you
have an explanation just go through the
explanation that is more than sufficient
for this coming to the next one that is
question number 33 that is reduced
celery flow following irradiation is the
dose dependent and what at what those
does the saliva flow will be almost zero
okay which is already discussed on the
group answer is C that is 6000 RTS next
134th question is about the SI units of
radioactivity this is already discussed
down the group okay so this is a chart
that you have to make a knot and the
easiest way of course you know the SI
units they come first in the traditional
units they comes next so if you want
radio
dooty you can remember it with a cold
RPC are P and C okay and equivalent dose
and effective dose you can remember with
a code t s you don't remember with the
court ESI so rest all you need to
practice make a node don't get confuse
this conversion is again an important
area where they can ask for multiple
questions coming to the thirty fourth
question what is this a unit of
radioactivity the answer is B so next
course is the best x-ray for the mean
students you can see an inverted
supernumerary here the best radiograph
for any students is occlusion data graph
apart from this you can see in the
occlusion radiographic and season every
submandibular canna clay also okay that
is also again the radiograph of choices
occlusion radiograph coming to the
question number 36 by twin radiographs
are taken mostly to to enhance I mean
the best option right now here is the
proximal care is okay the best option to
identify the best radiographed to
identify the proximal carries is by twin
and even you can go for a better option
like a paddling and you'll take any call
so is a best option to identify the
proximal carries the next verse is the
localization of an object is done by
question number 37 that is tube shift
rule so we are going to discuss about
that in the group which is nothing but
slow blow rule I hope you are very good
at this that it's also called as a
buckle shift by changing the angulation
you can identify the object localization
coming to the next 138 digital imaging
computerized radiography is made up of I
hope you know this the answer is pixels
I hope you know the difference between
woxall infection and everything so just
do read that there's an important area
question number 39 radiographic
technique used to identify the spatial
relationship of an object is called as
the cone technique question number 40 by
setting angle technique is based upon
the rule of I so made
me okay we are going to discuss that in
the upcoming video the next comes is 41
question number 41 x-rays are incense to
to which light which light means the
light that is used in the x-ray x-rays
the light that is used in the radiology
department is insensitive if you see we
be cheap this is insensitive to this end
okay so by which you can go for option
as in low Internet question number 42
so please do make a note about this okay
this table is very very very very
important and particularly you are very
good at films okay but you need to make
a note about CCD and C YMS and PSP all
these differences are very very
important if you see question number 42
image replication is a good and a
perfect perfect width okay so it's a
good and perfect with the I mean the
recent advances in the radiology because
all those are computer based so how many
duplications you will do you get the
same product out them you can see the
last line yeah where the electron copies
are stored on various mediums without
any loss of quality so there is no loss
of quality they are all good safe and
perfect okay so next comes is the
question number 43 so question number 43
the formula is T is T means the exposure
time is directly proportional to d
square that is the distance square by K
VP into em okay you need to apply this
the formula is T 1 by T 2 is equal to D
1 by D 2 whole square if we apply this
for 43rd question okay the answer will
be 2 seconds I hope you can handle this
if you want you can add this okay there
are two types of effects one is
deterministic and second one is stick
and the easy way to identify this is de
is cell death it causes the death of the
same so the example that comes under
this is death of the cell death of
celebre star away gland cells okay needs
to zero stroma death of bone cells death
of cells in the eye okay so all these
are the leads to the death of a cell
second one is they are the damages the
DNA okay so they are they causes some
gene mutation or dream manipulation
which leads to leukemia which leads to
carcinoma which leads abnormal tumors
which leads to some hereditary disorders
so that's the difference between these
two and it is against the most common
question so there was a few people
asking about this okay that is acute
radiation syndrome so basing upon the
doses the manifestations will vary and
if you see the question number 44 in
acute radiation syndrome severe
hemophilic symptoms are seen at severe
okay so see we are seen at four to seven
okay the answer is four to seven guys so
basing upon that they can if it is more
than fifty here is the answer will be
CBS and see and the symptoms will be
manifestations will be seen
question number forty five is a very
easy question that is the definition of
osteonecrosis the answer is a question
number 46 please do market that is very
very important in the treatment of
carcinoma the fraction of total doses
that is given in each appointment ranges
at 150 Arrietty okay question number 47
the treatment of carcinoma with
radiation by inserting an internal
implant okay so if it is internal that
is brachytherapy if it is external that
is tele turfing next goes to the
question number 48 before going to the
question number 48 we'll learn something
related to this field which is given in
your item fara the film of speed lower
than II should not be used for the
dental radiographs okay he can be used
it lower than II should not be used
three groups d e and their compassion
so when compared with de is twice as
faster as
and decrease the exposure by 40% days
and if we compare F decrease the
exposure by 75% s and please to make a
note about this point that is F is most
preferred than any other films in the
dentistry right now and digital sensors
are better than f films how they are
better in decreasing the radiation but
if you see the resolution the resolution
will be more further intraoral film set
its f film will have more resolution I
hope you will have more resolution than
the digital sensor but if you see the
exposure exposure will be less for the
digital sensor which is good for the
patient and the next question is about
the speed in the in the form of
numericals okay but make a note the
speed is measured in this units that is
the reciprocal of long strip reciprocal
okay this is these are the speed values
which are given C D E okay C is 6 to 12
224 24 to 48 48 this is just double of
each and everything this is actually the
table that is given in the old edition
of fight answer but there is a slight
modification in the new edition
according to which the option is given
but if you see the D here it is 12 to 14
but in the new edition it is fourteen to
twenty seven point nine okay the latest
speeds were given in your power-play
books just have enough the values in the
old edition and the new edition almost
they are almost same with a slight
variation okay but the best option
should be the new edition but may cannot
remember the old option also because
there are few paper centers they can
pick questions from the old edition of
the white and Pharaoh
and I don't want you to get trapped the
best option will be the new values okay
so fortieth question the answer is a the
next course is the 49th question the
three guidelines in radiation protection
are you can remember with a word
J oh t j for justification
over-optimization be for those
limitation
next goes to the 50
it's a very known thing a l.a are a
stands for as low as reasonably HC over
okay so I'm Dunford today's paper
make a note please do finish this paper
this paper will be having a tag line of
radiation physics radiation biology and
principles of geometry
