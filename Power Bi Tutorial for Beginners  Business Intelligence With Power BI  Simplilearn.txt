having said over to our training experts
before I start off with our top 5 bi
tools I'd like to talk a bit about
business intelligence
as you might be aware there are zillions
of companies across the world these
companies generate massive amounts of
data on a daily basis when I say data
here it simply refers to business
information both internal and external
customer feedback product Innovations
and profit loss reports to name a few
companies use all of this information to
make crucial decisions that can either
hamper or boost their business
you might have heard of the term data as
the new oil well it definitely is if
organizations analyze all the available
data very well then this oil is
definitely valuable
and to help organizations with this we
have business intelligence which is more
often termed as bi
we can Define bi as a technology driven
process which works on analyzing
unstructured data to derive meaningful
information from it basically it is a
set of architecture and processes that
convert raw data into useful information
that helps in achieving profit for a
business
so to achieve business intelligence
goals we use a set of tools these tools
are termed as bi tools they help
organizations acquire and analyze data
efficiently
some of the bi tools are seasonal but
some are evergreen we have a plethora of
these tools in the market which makes it
hard for businesses to select one single
tool
here we have a recommendation list of
the top 5 bi tools of 2020 after
extensive research and an in-depth
evaluation we have come up with this
list
in addition to the top 5 we also have a
few other tools which look promising for
the year 2020.
so let us have a look at the top 5 bi
tools

some of the popular tools are power bi
Tableau and click view hi guys welcome
to this tutorial on what is power bi in
this video you will learn why power bi
is needed what is power bi the various
features of power bi and the different
components of power bi later you will
look at the architecture of power bi for
power bi services and how to create a
power bi dashboard finally you will
understand a case study on Meyer and do
a demo using power bi now let's
understand why power bi is needed first
Power Pi has the ability to access vast
volumes of data from multiple sources it
allows you to view analyze and visualize
huge quantities of data that cannot be
opened in Excel some of the important
data sources available in power bi RXL
CSV XML Json PDF Etc second power bi
provides an easy to use drag and drop
tool with features and functionalities
that allow you to copy all formatting
across similar visualizations power bi
has exceptional integration with Excel
it helps you gather analyze publish and
share Excel business data power bi helps
to accelerate Big Data preparation with
Azure using power bi with Azure allows
you to analyze and share vast volumes of
data as your data leak can reduce the
time it takes to get insights and
increase collaboration between business
analysts data engineers and data
scientists power bi allows you to get
insights from data and turn insights
into actions to take data-driven
business decisions finally power bi
allows you to perform real-time stream
analytics it fetches data from multiple
sensors and social media sources to get
access to real-time analytics so you are
always ready to make business decisions
now let's see what power bi is power bi
is a business Analytics service provided
by Microsoft that lets you visualize
your data and share insights it converts
data from different sources to build
interactive dashboards and bi reports as
you can see we have an Excel data about
sales using this data power bi helps you
build different charts and graphs to
visualize the data now that we have
understood what power bi is let us look
at the important features of power bi
first is power bi desktop power bi
desktop is a free software that you can
download and it allows you to build
reports by accessing data easily for
using power bi desktop you do not need
Advanced report designing or query
skills to build a report second as
already discussed power bi supports
stream analytics from Factory sensors to
social media sources power bi assists in
real-time analytics to make timely
decisions third support for multiple
data sources is one of the major
features of power bi you can access
various sources of data such as Excel
CSV SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of power bi while dealing with complex
data power bi's default standard might
not be enough in some cases in that case
you can access the custom library of
visualization that meets your needs let
us jump into discussing the various
components of power bi as you can see
there are six major components of power
bi now let's discuss them one by one
first is power query power query is the
data transformation and mashup engine it
enables you to discover connect combine
and refine data sources to meet your
analysis need it can be downloaded as an
add-in for Excel or can be used as part
of power via desktop second we have
power pivot power pivot is a data
modeling technology that lets you create
data models it also allows you to
establish relationships and create
calculations it uses data analysis
expression language or Dax to model
simple and complex data third we have
power view Power view is a technology
that is available in Excel SharePoint
SQL server and power bi AI it lets you
create interactive charts graphs maps
and other visuals that brings your data
to Life Next we have power map
Microsoft's power map for Excel and
power bi is a 3D data visualization tool
that lets you map your data and plot
more than a million rows of data
visually on Bing maps in 3D format from
an Excel table or data model in Excel
then we have power bi desktop power bi
desktop is a development tool for power
query power pivot and Power view with
power bi desktop you have everything
under the same solution and it is easier
to develop bin data analysis experience
finally we have power Q and A the Q and
A feature in power bi lets you explore
your data in your own words it is the
fastest way to get an answer from your
data using natural language an example
could be what was the total sales last
year once you have built your data model
and deployed that into Power bi website
then you can ask questions and get
answers easily now let's see what RBI
Services power bi service is the
software as a service part of power bi
it is also referred as power bi online
to access power bi service you need to
log into app.powerbi.com now let me show
you that I'll go to Google
open a new tab and search for app dot
power bi
.com
it's loading
but this is how the home page of power
bi service looks like I have created
some dashboards on it first you need to
log into app.power bi service you can
see I'm logged in now under my workspace
if I go to dashboard here I've created a
finance dashboard you can see the
different charts and graphs I have
prepared and pinned it to the dashboard
so power bi service allows you to
connect to your data create reports and
dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data as you can see in
this dashboard we have created some
charts and graphs so this is a tree map
there's a pie chart there's a bar graph
below you can see the line charts and
donut charts it tells you the total
sales that were made the total number of
units solds the sales by product sales
by country sales by segment and lots
more one of the key features of power bi
is creating dashboards from multiple
reports and data sets power bi dashboard
is a single page visualization to tell a
story the visualizations on a dashboard
are generated from multiple reports and
each report is based on one data set a
single page dashboard is known as a
canvas the visualizations you see on the
dashboard are called tiles these tiles
are pinned to the dashboard by report
designers now let me go back to my
dashboard so this is called a canvas and
each of these are called tiles so on the
top you can see we have three tiles now
let's understand how to create and
publish reports in power bi dashboards
power bi allows you to create different
reports on power bi desktop these
reports can be published on the power bi
dashboard using power bi service here
you can see there is a power bi report
created on power bi desktop if you click
on publish it will take you to the power
bi service where you can build a
dashboard here is the button for power
bi publish once you click on power bi
publish it will take you to the
dashboard so this is a single page power
bi dashboard on power bi service now
let's understand the power bi
architecture power bi architecture is a
service built on top of azure there are
multiple data sources that power bi can
connect to power bi desktop allows you
to create reports and data
visualizations on the data set Power bi
Gateway is connected to on-premise data
sources to get continuous data for
reporting and Analytics power bi
services are basically the cloud
services that are used to publish power
bi reports and data visualizations using
power bi mobile apps you can stay
connected to their data from anywhere
power bi apps are available for Windows
IOS and Android platforms now let's look
at a case study on how Meyer which is
one of United States largest Supermarket
chains use power bi to solve its
business problems initially Meyer had
become dependent on its it organization
to extract insights from its data it was
time consuming and inefficient as you
had to wait for it to build every report
Meyer was unable to perform ad hoc and
real-time analysis easily so what Maya
did was it connected power bi to an
on-premises SQL Server analysis Services
Cube this allowed them to refresh 20
billion rows of data in near Real Time
with power bi teams can now pull in the
data faster and perform real-time
analysis to derive insights from data a
bakery department inside Meyer used
power bi to compare its sales with
regional performance performance they
analyzed where Meyer was behind the
regional Trends focused on the problem
and created a solution with power bi
they can now drill down into hourly
sales and send out a sales flash to 800
Maya Business Leaders so power bi
enabled them to standardize data sources
and Empower store directors and team
leaders to develop and track their data
to ensure what they can improve now
let's do some practical Hands-On demo
with power bi so this is how the power
bi desktop interface looks like on the
left you have the report view the data
View and the model view the report view
is where you visualize your data with
different charts and graphs to build
reports the data view allows you to view
the whole data while the model view is
where you check if there are any
relationship between the tables on the
right you can see the different
visualizations that you can build we'll
quickly run through all of these in our
demo
so here you can see there's a finance
sample data that will help you draw
insights about the sale of products in
different countries we will create a
report to visualize different charts and
graphs and analyze those sales so let me
go to my power bi desktop first we'll
import our data so let me go to our get
data Tab and choose Excel as my data
source I click on Excel so here is our
finance sample data
we'll select sheet1 you can see the data
here click on it and then select load
this might take some time to load the
data now if I go to my data tab you can
see the entire data set it has Fields
such as segment country in which the
Salesforce made the name of the product
the unit sold and the sales price and
many more let's start building a report
now I'll go to my report view so first
let me create a text box
let me resize it
let me name it as
Finance dashboard will increase the size
of the text we'll use Font Consolers
Center it will also add a background to
this we use blue color change it to
White
which is the size now let me first show
you how you can create a matrix I'll go
to visualizations and click on Matrix
let me resize it
from the data sheet tab I'll select
sales and drag on to values
so you can see the total number of sales
that were made now let me do some
formatting so I'll go to the format tab
click on column headers let's add a
background color and let me increase the
text size to 20. similarly under values
we'll increase the size of the text to
20 as well we can also click on border
and choose the color of the Border we
take as it will be black so this is a
simple Matrix that we created which
shows the total number of sales that
were made similarly let me choose Matrix
once again now we'll drag on the unit
sold onto values we'll continue with the
same drill under column headers We'll
add a background this time let's choose
some other color and under values let's
increase the size of the text to 20.
even for the column headers let's
increase the size of the text to 20.
again we will switch on Border let me
resize a bit
so here we have two Matrix created for
our report the first Matrix shows us the
total sales that were made the second
Matrix shows you the total units that
were sold now let's move ahead and
create a simple bar chart so under
visualization I click on clustered
column chart
under this we'll drag the date column
onto access and the sales onto value let
me expand it so it shows you the sales
per year this is the sales that were
made in 2013 and this shows you the
sales that were made in 2014. now
there's a drill down option which gives
you more granularity
this depicts the sales per quarter if I
drill down further you can see this
shows you the sales by month also you
have some options like sort by sort by
sales so you can see October month with
the highest number of sales
moving ahead let me now create a pie
chart where we will see the sales by
different segments under visualization
I'll click on pie chart let me first
resize it
here
I'll drag the segment column onto the
legend and the sales column onto the
values as you can see we have the sales
made by different segments government
segment made the highest number of sales
with 44.22 percent now let me add a
border to both the visualization I'll
click on the pie chart and go to the
format tab I'll switch on the border
similarly for the clustered column chart
I'll go to the format Tab and click on
border now let me resize a bit alright
next we'll create a very simple table
that will depict the total sales made by
each product so under visualizations I
click on table let me bring this below
so from the data sheet I'll first drag
product onto values you can see the
different products and then sales just
below it
so this depicts the total sales that
were made by each product and finally it
displays the total value of the sales
that were made this is same as the one
shown here now let's do some formatting
under format tab I'll go to values and
increase the text size to 15. and expand
it also under column headers I'll
increase the text size to 15. then let
me go and add a border
now let me create a map that will show
you the sales that were made by each
country so first let me create a new
page and under visualization I'll click
on map now I'll drag the country column
onto location
so you can see we have our map ready and
we'll drag sales onto size
you can see the different countries and
the sales that they made if I move the
map you can see the sales made in the
Europe region
let me resize it I'll add a border to
this
now let me go ahead and create a donut
chart that will show you the profit by
each segment under visualizations I'll
click on donut chart
and move this to the top now from the
data sheet I'll add profit onto the
values and segment
onto the legend
if I expand this you can see government
segment made the highest amount of
profit with 65.04 percent let me resize
this and we'll add a border
okay in the final visualization I'll
show you how to create a tree map this
tree map will tell you the total amount
of sales made by each product so under
visualizations I'll click on the tree
map let me expand it
I'll drag sales onto values and product
onto group so here you can see our tree
map and the sales made by each product
you can see now we have a report ready
we have created two separate canvas to
visualize our data now if you want to
change the color of these parts you can
simply go to the format Tab and under
data colors you can choose whichever
color you want in power bi desktop you
have an option to switch your theme this
will make your dashboard or the report
look more attractive so now we are under
the default mode Let's try out different
themes let's Frontier temperature solar
which is a little yellowish the one
which I like is tidal I hope this was
helpful in making you understand the
basics of power bi and how it works you
learn the various features and the
components of power bi and looked at the
architecture of RPI let's learn about
power bi through a quick demo by
uploading some data sets and playing
with those data sets let's look at a
sample data set and let's upload it
and as I explained while uploading let's
also transform the data so that we can
have selective fields or selected data
loaded here instead of loading the
complete data set and then let's see how
we can visualize this or how we can use
the information in this data set now
what we can do here is we can click on
get data and then we can choose one of
the data formats which we would be
looking for so for example I can go for
Excel and basically
click on this now here are some of my
data sets so let's look into the folder
here and these data sets are also
available on my GitHub link which I'll
share with you later so here we have
something called a Superstore let's
click on this and here I already have a
data set which is global Superstore or I
also have selective data so let's select
this one click on open
now that's basically connecting to my
data source and that will show me what
does that Excel sheet have so it has
different tabs which is orders people
and returns so let's select orders
and that basically gives me a preview of
the data which I have and if you scroll
all the way to right it shows me city
state and then country and if you see
here we do see information of all the
countries now this can be huge amount of
data which may which we would want look
into but say for example my use case is
that I am interested in looking for the
data for United States and as a country
and all it states so we will do that
when we do a transform now we can also
select the returns Tab and that shows me
these three Fields however the first row
should have been the heading of this
particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on transform
data now once you do that it brings you
your toolkit that brings you your power
query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or return
status source as you see here so we see
column one column two and column three
and that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
also do a merge query or append query so
as of now let's just say use first row
as headers and that basically shows that
now my first row has become the header
you also see in the applied steps it
basically tells me if I have changed the
type of the data if I have made any
other changes those steps will get added
here so it basically shows me the name
as it returns it shows me applied steps
where I have changed the type and now I
basically have this information now this
is something where you can change the
type or you can basically set it to a
particular format however we are not
doing anything of that sort right now so
we can do that for any of these columns
so this looks good when it comes to
orders let's click on this and as I said
and I would be interested in selecting
for country as United States only and
let me just work on that data however we
can work on all the data so let me
scroll all the way to right and here I
have the country now there are these
filters which we can use so basically I
can click on this and that shows me all
the countries are selected now there is
also something called as text filters
which we will see how we can use to
select particular data I basically have
other ways of filtering the data so for
example now I will just uncheck this
select all and what I would be
interested is in United States so let's
type it here that shows me has an option
here select this and then basically say
okay
so that should basically now filter out
and it shows me the data is United
States only and then you have different
states and rest of the data remains so
if you look at the applied steps it
tells me that there are filtered rows
now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set on
these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
which says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the changes
which I have performed using my query
editor that is I have transformed the
data so that I can have selective data
uploaded in my power bi now it's doing
that it shows me it is working on both
of these data sources that is orders and
returns so that's done and now basically
if there are any other pending changes
we can just do a close and apply so that
basically has closed and now you would
see the data appearing here so I have
uploaded the data as per my preferences
now if you click on the data tab here so
it basically shows you your data fields
it might take some time to populate but
if you see in the country field now if
even if I click on the filter it just
shows me United States now that's what
we wanted so we have already uploaded
this data in orders you can always
expand the option here which shows me
all the fields which are there in this
might be this is an aggregation might be
that's an order date so this is again
some kind of aggregation we can change
the data types so we are looking at all
the fields in my order stable or
basically coming from the orders data
source I also have returns which shows
me three fields and that shows me the
data which is returned order ID and
region so the column names are applied
correctly as we want and that basically
looks fine now we can also look at your
model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which relates to orders
and returns then that would fail because
it would say there is no relationship
now I can go to the first option which
says report and we have not created any
report here although we can create a
simple report we can look at the data so
we have our orders field now we can
basically pull out some information from
here we can choose what kind of report
we may want to create so for example
let's go for the table option from
visualizations you have various options
here which we can use this is where you
can do a formatting this is where you
can select the fields this is where you
can search and filter out the data you
can also add data fields here so first
let's click on table
and that basically gives me a table now
this table as of now does not have
anything so you can use the filter and
slices
option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have
orders here so this is my orders and I
would like to work on this so let's say
for example country is I can select
country as a field and if you say it
shows me country is all as of now and it
says the value is United States what I
can also do is I'm interested in the
states so I have state now I can
basically drag and drop it here and then
the state gets added here so I can
basically say select all and that should
basically take care of my State field
being added here so state is all country
is all now we can basically look at
something else so might be let's choose
sales and I can just drag and drop sales
here so that basically says if you would
want to have any kind of advanced
filtering which says filter type so go
for it Advanced filtering is less than
or equal or you can also go for advanced
filters so that's fine as of now so we
have added some Fields here and that's
basically
my data here so let's go for filters
here
which basically should select all my
fields
now if you see the visualization shows
my country sales and state which we had
either by selecting the fields and
dropping them here or you can in this
section where it says field so you can
for example let me show it again so I
can just delete this I can click on the
table option I can just drag it here I
can basically make it bigger and I need
to add data to this one so it says add
data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested in States
so let's drop that here and let's say
sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can basically increase the font
here we can change the grid color so for
example let's make it for example blue
so I can just select this
and it should basically
allow me to have the grid color as blue
now I can go in for the grid thickness I
can go for row padding outline color so
we can basically make it a little bit
more readable and then we can basically
increase the font size here
to look at the information
and you have other options here so what
would you want to do with column headers
so I can basically have the font color
background color is fine do you want to
have an outline do you want to have a
change in font what is the text size
might be we can make the heading a
little bigger and then basically you
also have the field formatting so all
those code be done you could go for
background and all these things can be
done in formatting so now we already
have our data here and this basically
looks good and this is basically one of
my visuals which I have here and this
has given me some information for sales
and basically I can scroll this I can
also make it bigger
so I could select a particular field if
I'm more interested in looking at the
information for a particular State now I
can add more fields to this
so this is my one of the reports which I
have created now what I can do with this
report is I can basically have more data
fields I can add filters to this I can
basically look into all the data here by
just clicking somewhere in the grid but
somewhere outside if you select a
particular row then that data shows up
here you have an option of focus mode
which you can go for you can look at the
other options which says export data now
if this is the data which you are
interested in you can export it you can
always to show as a table if you are
interested in you can do a sort by
country sales or state so for example
let's do a sorting by state
and that basically gives me the data
which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me
alphabetically this is the information
which I have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a power bi file which has an
extension of pbix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say state
wise sales in
USA
let's say
USA and that basically is my first
report
now
once you have saved this report you can
always look on your machine for example
if I go in here and if I go into this
folder might be I should look on desktop
and this is where I should have saved it
so it shows me first report statewise
that will open up in power bi and we
have created a simple report which we
have basically used by taking our data
now I can also do is I can publish this
if I would want to share this
information so publish this report
online in power bi service you can
basically select
your report what we have here and I
clicked on publish so it says what's the
destination so you can have different
workspaces I will choose the default
that's my workspace I can click on
select now it says publishing first
report Statewide sales in USA to power
bi you can create a portrait view of
your report and you can do all that
stuff so let it publish and then we can
basically look into our power bi server
that's our service where the information
is already shared
are published I would say which can then
be shared with different resources so we
can come here and basically I can look
into the power bi and this is where I
will be able to look into my workspaces
and let's look in my workspace so it
says this is the place where I had
initially downloaded power bi data set
it says your data set is ready let power
bi help you explore your data right so
you can always do this you can click on
view data set
which basically allows you to bring out
your workspace and first report State
why sales now that's the report which we
have published so let's first check in
our desktop if that's done so it says
success open first report in power bi
now I can click on this one straight
away and that takes me to my service now
once it takes me to the service it shows
me the report which we created which we
published and it basically has the
option where I can save it
as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in the
in a website or a portal I can publish
to web
embed this report for Public Access by
anyone on the internet we can do that we
can export it to PowerPoint so we can do
all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are
interested in something specific
you can do a sharing to teams so if you
have your teams or groups set up you can
share it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically view
usage metrics report now that can be
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with power bi Pro will have access
to the support recipients will have the
same access as you unless row level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them
look at this report
right you can also allow recipients to
build new content using the underlying
data sets and you can send an email
notification to the user so as of now I
don't have any other groups so I'll not
be sharing it but I have created a
simple report now let's also look at
edit report let's just to see what it
helps us and when you click on edit
report it basically brings up this one
which says your file view it gives you
the filters it basically
allows you to add data fields to this so
it is basically giving access to these
data sets which were in my desktop
it is basically allowing you to give or
create different visualizations now here
we have the data which we are looking at
and if say for example somebody is
interested in filtering the data so you
could do that so you could click on
filter here and that basically applies
this is the filter we have now country
is fine sales might be I can click on
sales and I would say okay let's look at
sales which is more than a particular
amount so we can say is greater than and
might be I can give a number here so I
can say 30
000.
and basically
I can say apply filter
so right now I'm applying filter and I
would look at the values which also
shows me the total value is changed so
you have not only created a report you
have published it and now
from the service you can edit it so I'm
looking at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say first
report underscore
state wise sales and I will say modified
so let's do a save
and the report has been saved
so now you're looking at the data here
so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace here
I can click on reports and that does
show me my previous report it shows me
the modified report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metrics so let's
click on this one and that basically
shows me the report usage metrics which
is generated so views for day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports
and that basically took me to usage
metrics I could be sharing it I can
analyze in Excel I can look for quick
insights based on this data what we have
you can basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me
the data sets which can be used to
create further reports and we have our
data here
so
for example if I click on create report
it basically gives me these data sets
and we can continue working on this so
this is how I have a simple report
created without basically working on two
different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have
and say you would want to add some
Fields so let's go to returns and say
for example I would be interested in
looking at the the products so might be
what I should do is I should replace the
report here instead of country it would
be interesting to look at the product
which we have or basically customer ID
so we can look at customer ID we can
look at the order ID which would be
interesting to see if there is a
particular order what was the sales
which was generated and if there were
any returns which were happening on that
so for example here when I have these
let me cut out country as a field and I
will basically take order ID and place
it here so now if you see my data has
been easily modified so I have my order
ID I have sales and I have statewise
information so you have basically all
the information but this is now order ID
State and so on now what if I would want
to also see
based on the order ID if I say I would
want the returned field
so for example I would want to take this
one and let's drag and drop it here now
that says cannot display the visual now
why is that so if you click on see
details that says cannot determine
relationships between the fields so it
cannot display the data because power bi
cannot determine the relationship
between two or more fields and how do we
fix that so for example if I click on
fix this now it says there is a missing
relationship between these fields use
Auto detect to search for relationships
or create them manually now I can click
on auto detect which will try to search
for fields which exist in both the data
sets or basically I can create
relationships so let's click on create
relationships and that basically takes
me to this page which says there are no
relationships defined
from table to table and so on so I can
click on new
now here it says select the tables and
the columns that are related now I can
say orders now those are my Fields where
you have order IDs and it automatically
shows that returns also has an order ID
field although all the values might not
be same but this is how you can create a
relationship and it says the cardinality
says many to one so you can have
basically many to one relationship you
are saying cross filter Direction is
single so make this relationship active
and it has already helped us basically
identifying the field so I can say okay
so it says now these two tables should
be related or should be connected based
on order ID so
here we have this and let's basically
say close
now once that is done if you see
I have order ID I have returned
I have sales column and I have state and
if you see in return I do have a value
of yes which shows this particular order
ID had generated some sales and it was
for state Alabama and it was returned
and the value is yes so if you scroll
down you basically see all the values
now we can add different filters where
we can say I would want only yes and no
now this is again an interesting report
so let's go in also into the formatting
and what we can do is we can look at say
the grid option if we would want to
basically say vertical grid and let's
say
on
and it says vertical grid color so let's
select this might be I can try doing a
black here it puts it in the right nice
table format and that basically looks
good so you have
sales returned and so on and this is
basically the order which I am seeing
here so for example if I would want to
change the order and if I'm saying okay
I would like to look at sales and
returned and so on so we can be doing
that we can come here and say for
example I have sales and returned let's
try moving the sales column over here
might be state is uh and information
which we would want in the beginning so
let me also move the states all the way
here so it gives me state it gives me
the order ID sales and if there was a
return which was happening on that
particular product so easily I've
modified my report now what I can do is
I can just save it
and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and now here
we will also see how you can load some
data and perform some Transformations
and basically get multiple results or
multiple tables or multiple data sets
which can be then further used for
reporting so power bi does give you a
lot of options now here you have an
option as we saw earlier that is get
data or what you can do is you have an
option where you can create new data
also which says enter data now this is
something which can be easily used if
you have relatively less number of
fields so you can basically add more
columns here and you can basically add
values so for example if I would just
call it something like
um scientist ID
okay and then I can say scientist name
and then basically I can say uh domain
and then I can say for example let's say
year of joining and and I can keep
adding the number of columns here I can
delete the columns right and I can give
this and I can say country
so that's it and now we have created
these five countries sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID be
22 3 4 I can give some name so let's
give Peter let's say domain and I can
say bio technology
I can give year of joining 2011 and I
can say Germany as the country
and I really don't want this particular
column so I can go ahead and delete this
now I can come here and then I can give
something else so I can say this is
scientist ID I can give John let's say
the scientist is mainly working in
physics
and then I can say 2018 and let's say
France
and go back here and let's say
four five six seven and let's say Marie
and let's say she does her research in
uh molecules and let's call it 2001 and
let's say
Italy
okay and you can continue adding data in
this way now you can say if the data is
already here so I can say for example no
I do not want this particular row
I do not want this particular row
so you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so here we
have to give some name so let's say
scientists
okay and then if you choose edit it
basically brings up your power bi editor
which allows you to work on these fields
if you would want to make some changes
now we can make some changes here we can
see what are the number of rows we can
basically perform any kind of
transactions here so this one basically
tells me what is the data type so here
we see scientist ID and this clearly
tells me this is an integer however we
will not want to do any kind of
computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work on this particular
column what I can also do is I can just
click on this and this tells me that you
would want to change it to date time or
you want to change it to some number so
I can just say string because we are not
going to perform any computation here so
on the ID column so let say text and I'm
changing it so it says replace current
add a new steps or selected column has
an existing type conversion would you
like to replace the existing conversion
or preserve the existing so I will say
replace current and now the data type
has been changed it is of a string and
if you see this step has got added here
so it says that the change type
is the kind of transformation we did
here so that's fine now what we can also
do is we have the scientist name but we
don't like the column name here so it
would be good to change this
so there is something called as remove
or remove columns and so on so when you
do a right click it gives you a lot of
options in applying filters or doing
some transformation if I just click on
this one so what I can do is I can look
at the date time
and let's go here so we have an option
which says do you want to change the
type now we could have done that here or
like I said you could choose the time
and do it you can just say transform and
how do you want to change it so do you
want to change it to uppercase well you
can do that and changes all the values
of this one
what I can do is I can again do it right
click and I can choose basically if you
would want to clean up the data or if
you would want to convert to lowercase
you want to capitalize each word so
let's choose that and if you see here
the steps are getting added now to undo
any particular step if I just cancel
this then I'm back to this if I cancel
this I'm back to my original form so you
get any time undo your changes and you
can basically work on this so we are
working on this particular column now
there are various other options that you
can look at so for example these are
this is some of my data but it does not
have much information it would be good
to load some bigger data set and then
use these Transformations or basically
working on changing the data types as I
mentioned or if you would want to do a
filtering and remove certain fields and
only select particular Fields if that's
what you're interested doing a right
click where I want to create a copy of
this and then basically I can
use that particular copy now what I can
also do is I can add column from
examples I can duplicate column and then
I can make some changes to that so this
is my duplicate column and say for
example you would want uh this one to be
changed so we can say remove duplicates
we can basically if you are doing some
kind of change you want to change the
format here you can do that you can use
for other things like filling up and all
that now I can just call it rename and
let's say
um Alias scientist name right and I can
continue adding columns or I can do some
Transformations and once you have done
with these transactions now this one if
you see it shows as integer but is it an
integer no this is an date format so I
can go for modeling and change the
formats what I can also do is I can
select this and it says it's not a
decimal it's not a fixed decimal it is
date time it is date it is date time and
time zone
right and you can select any one of
these so for example let's make a date
which makes it more meaningful but then
what happens is when you do this it is
going for the default dates or the older
dates so I don't like that so what we
will have to do is we will have to
basically transform this and here we
have transform you have change type so
you have date and time you have date you
have time so let's choose date and time
and if you see here it gives me some
default timing based on these values
which we do not like so again filter it
out but what we can do is we can just
make sure that this is changed or you
want to make it a string because we are
not going to do any computation here so
I can keep it as date but then if I have
more Fields like month and days and so
on then you can do that so here it also
has
the option so when you have selected
this you have an option called transform
and transpose sorry transform also has
various options which allow you to work
on these do you want to do some
scientific calculations do you want to
work on
the date field so as of now it is just
integer so we can use one of these we
can do a group by but obviously we don't
have much data here so as of now let us
retain this I can just change this to
text and that's okay because we are
going to look at this later we can add
more data and work on it so as of now
once we have done all these changes you
can go back to say home and here you
have close and apply and I can basically
say close and apply so the changes will
be applied and then my new table which
we just created by entering some random
data performing some basic
transformations
will be available so if you look into
this one
so that's where my data is it shows me
the columns but there is no aggregated
column as such here you don't see any
summation Mark you just see the field
names or the column names you see the
values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no
or there is no existence of a different
table which you can join these tables or
you can perform some transactions come
back to the data set so this looks good
and we have it here now obviously we
have not created any visualization based
on this which we can and we can continue
working on it so here this is my data
set which is a small table where we have
created some data and we can use it
anytime now let's work on a bigger data
set and see what kind of Transformations
we can do we can then also see on
modeling or basically using some smarter
ways of working with the data
so what we would want to do is we would
want to load some data here so let's go
into
sorry let's go into home let's go to get
data let's use our old store data and
I'm going to take the global Superstore
which is huge data set with all the
countries and the products and the sales
which have happened and we can take this
data but before loading it as I
suggested earlier we should basically
transform the data we should basically
transform the data so that you don't end
up loading everything and you don't work
on all the data I mean unless you really
want to so here I will this Excel sheet
which I'm talking about has two
different tabs we have used it before so
let's use orders let's use returns and
that basically shows me the data what we
have so I can do a load but that's not
what we would want to do so you can do a
load and you can get all the data but
let's go to transform
make some basic Transformations before
we load the data so our power bi editor
allows us to work on this now here we
have
it says this preview may be up to nine
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because that's what
I want so it is basically
setting the first row as header which
looks good and we have some order IDs we
have the
returned If the product was returned so
let's look at the filter here so it just
has yes values which we are looking at
so
it says list may be incomplete let's say
load more
and let's see what are the filters here
so either there might be a product which
is returned or it might be blank field
so that is chosen so that's fine we have
order ID we have region which is
basically showing me different regions
here let's look at orders and orders is
again having your row ID order ID order
date ship date ship mode so you have
quite large amount of data here for your
different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now
I can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now
here we have this row ID and if you see
the row ID is an integer obviously we
will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here
you don't have any row ID but here we
have row ID so let's make it uh from
integer let's make it string and I'll
say replace current so that's that looks
fine it's a row ID which we will use to
search but we are not going to perform
any computations unless you want to find
on an average on row ID or anything else
now you have order IDs so what we can do
is we can filter some values
we can rename the field as we desired
right so for example let's go in here
and what we can do is let's go into
a customer ID ship
okay and here you have say State you
have region
okay now at any point of time if I would
want to filter out the values the easier
option is that you can select on this
one and here you can do some text
filtering
okay or you can basically select the
values from here so for example if I say
let's get rid of select all what we will
be interested in say United States and
UK that's the data we want and then I
can basically say okay so it is
basically going to filter out the data
which is for United States and UK as of
now now what we can also do is how about
doing some more filtering before we
basically work on this so let's go in
here and we are looking at United States
and UK related data and let's look at
it is sometimes good that you can
basically
work on the data here so for example I
go into orders now what I would want to
do is I would want to look at
the fields okay and we want to we have
not yet loaded the data so if you look
in the background I just have my
scientists because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields so can be used for grouping the
data so we will see that whenever you
have a data set you would already know
there are certain fields which have
repeated values which can be used to
group the data and we can do that we can
change any kind of values which are not
going to be computed on so for example I
have postal code I can use this but
again we are not going to find a postal
code which is greater than something
right so integer is not the valid type
let's change it to text okay and if for
example I would want to look at this so
I have done some
changes here
okay and this shows me null so for
example let me just revert this back and
let's make it
a whole number
okay so there are certain columns or
rows which do not have some values and
we can basically get rid of those values
so as of now we can do a filtering here
so let's keep the postal code AS integer
or let's
change it to text do a replace
content and now what we will do is we'll
scroll all the way right might be I'm
interested in technology category so
that's what I'm interested in so what I
can do is here I can do some filtering
so I can basically choose
technology now the easier way would be
since these are categories and there are
only three categories we really don't
want to go and apply text filters here
but if you had something like an office
supply and Office Inventory then you
could have done some text filters so
let's not do some text filtering here
what we can do is I would be interested
in technology so that's the field I'm
interested in so now you are only having
data which is related to technology
okay and you have some product names so
this is where we want to do some kind of
filtering so
we can rename the field we can select
some Fields so let's for example let's
go for
um
any of the field which I think might
have more entries here so for example
let's go for
Canon Wireless or Canon Image right so
let's go for product names and I will
say let's
go here
now I could have done a transformation
but that's not what we want we want to
do some it filtering so let's go to text
filter and here I can say begins with I
can say ends with I can say contains so
let's go for contains
and it says enter a value here so you
would want to keep the rows where the
product name contains something and it
gives you some suggestion
right so where you are seeing in some
values here so for example if I would
have selected this then it applies the
complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Canon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and
what do they contain
what kind of values you are looking for
so you can do that but we will not go
for advanced in one step let's go for
basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copiers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data when you look at the
country we are still focusing on United
States and United Kingdom that kind of
data right so we have filtered the data
we have done some
selection based on the data here and
what I can do is I can then
basically rename a particular field so I
can do that I can say I'm interested in
uh
um sales which is the data here we can
basically look into the quantity so
sales is something which we are
interested in but might be we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I am interested in sales or I am looking
at if the discount percentage was
something or if the profit was more
right so we can apply different kind of
values here but what we can do is with
these changes because you don't want to
transform and make changes all here
you want to make the changes once the
data set is uploaded so we have selected
some data we have create done some
Transformations we can basically break a
particular column into multiple columns
if that's what we want if we see that we
will do an aggregation based on year or
we will do a aggregation based on the
country or year and Order ID right so we
can break this data into multiple
columns so we can do that but for now
let's do a close and apply
and
let's apply this so that's going to
apply all these changes it's going to
load my data but remember now we are
having selective or selected data which
gets loaded so that should get be
available here so it takes time
sometimes so you have to wait and then
you can go ahead and check here so for
example now I'm looking in tables let's
basically minimize this let's go for
orders and this is the data I have which
obviously row ID if you see so you have
all the row IDs and again again you can
do filtering here but this is where you
have already loaded the data the data is
available and then you can start working
on the columns here so we have this if
you closely see we see this summation
Mark and this basically means that these
are my aggregated columns or these
values are measures which can be used
for calculations so we can see that we
can create on our own aggregations so we
can do that we can rename the field as
we have seen
we can filter out the data so we have
all the fields showing up from orders
and let's also look at the returns
which basically has the columns the
order ID and your region so it basically
shows the region here where was the
product returned from and we have this
information so what we are doing is we
when we were doing a text filter in the
previous example
remember it was case sensitive
okay and you have to take care of when
you're doing a text filter you have to
give a field which exactly matches as it
exists in the content now okay this is
the data we have and let's look at the
order column right now what we can do is
we can do some quick Transformations
here and we can basically look for
more data here so
let's say we have some filtering to be
done now I can do a filtering based on
my uh products
so we had all these products but now
let's do a filtering on product and then
products you have copiers you have
machines so you have mainly two
categories right and when you look at
machines it basically talks about your
PC
uh something so let's look for machines
and here we have basically The copier
fields which are more
so I can basically
go for filtering here
and that's the data we have so we don't
want to really unselect any of these
here but what I'm doing is I'm saying
text filter and let's go into this one
now and let's say contains
okay so I'm saying contains and then I
can basically say let's say copier
now that's what I'm interested in
and
show rows where product name contains
copier
okay now you can give a and condition
here so if you would want a specific
copier if you are interested in okay
let's also say
contains and let's go for laser also
laser and let's say okay
so you see the data gets filtered out
here and we have the sales which we are
seeing here so let's go to sales and we
will be interested in anything above 500
so let's go to sales
let's go for number filters let's say
greater than
and I will say for example 500 oh sorry
500
okay and
let's say okay so that basically filters
out the data and then I am also
interested in quantity Where I would
want the quantity to be
more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go in
here and you can basically choose what
is the filter you want so you can apply
any number of filters now you have the
filtering here you can always click on
the filter and if you want you can just
do a clear filter and the filtering will
be gone so you have all the data right
and
this is the particular data we have and
here I have say for example
product name now I can keep the filter
because I am interested only in these
values or I can filter out so this tells
me that when we did a and it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filters say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or
so last time we did an end and I'll do
it contains laser
so
let's choose this that gives me more
entries so either the product name has
copier or it has laser it has the
quantity it has the product name and we
have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as looks like the
country name uh the year and then the
order ID so we can basically split it up
so I can select this and here I have
option of
let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select this
if I just do a right click here
now here it just tells me do you want a
new column do you want to create a copy
of this column okay you want to create
copy table so this is your transformed
data what you have and for example let's
create a copy table
and let's come in here
so
you should be able to see your
copy table now so let's go in
and select this one
and what you need to do here is creating
a copy of this or copy table would not
be the right option what we can do is we
can work on transforming this rather
than doing it from here so you have this
option of adding a new column going for
a new measure renaming it right so
that's
okay but what we can do is Select this
particular column let's do a home and
first thing is let's go to transform so
I want to transform the data now let's
select this one and it brings up your
power editor again here we were
interested in orders so we are looking
at our data here
now if you see my country's United
States and UK so you can confirm that if
you look at category it is technology
product name has copier and Laser as we
selected so those things are retained so
you have not lost any changes as of now
so this order ID column what we have now
as I said you can be doing a filtering
okay you can select this particular
column and then you have other things
which can be used to transform here like
you want to change the data type you
want to use first row as header you want
to replace some values okay you want to
run some merge queries you want to do
some analytics so all these options are
here now what we can do is while this
column is selected I can do a right
click now there is an option called
transform which is basically going to
help me in changing the data here okay
now I can basically duplicate the column
so I really don't want to work on this
column itself but it would be good to
have
a duplicate column on which we can work
on so I can do a split column here if I
would want to but let's create a
duplicate column so let's say duplicate
column
now that gives me a duplicate column so
we can rename it later so now I will not
work on my original column but I'll work
on a duplicate column and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to basically
transform or split this so again where I
click now you have a split by so we can
say split by by delimiter or by number
or by characters or by position so by
lowercase and upper case so you can do
all of this so let's go for by delimiter
now if you see it basically identifies
the delimiter which is hyphen or Dash
now you can go for split at left most
identify right sorry left most
delimiters right most each occurrence of
delimiter and that's what we want to do
you can look into advanced options where
it says split into columns
so do you want to split that into
columns do you want to split that into
rows because that's more or less like
doing a group by and you can say number
of columns to split into so we have here
one two three four values so that looks
good to me and let's do say for example
if I choose three
so I can choose 3 and then split using
special characters so you could do that
so let's for example let's say okay
and let's look at the data how it looks
like we can anytime delete the data we
can keep it the way we want right so
what we did was
we created a copy of the column
then we did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a 3 as the
resulting column so I have the order ID
okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID year and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says t e c m a I'm looking at the
first one three seven zero zero and
that has in no relation to the order ID
right so we can make sure that there is
nothing which is conflicting with our
entries now once that is done so we have
order ID which can be used to categorize
the data you have order ID which is
basically the year okay and you have
order ID which is basically having some
more value now I can keep this data as I
want so I can basically click on this I
can go for renaming and I can say let's
say let's call it
order
ID
and let's say
IDs so let us in case there is a
particular column and you would want to
look at so
just give the name correctly now order
ID is find so here we will also rename
this one so let's call it
uh order
here
and that's going to be ordered here so
we can again change this to string
okay and here you have the order ID so
let's rename this one
and I have my
let's call order
number
right so we have we are seeing all the
steps which we have added here we just
split the data based on the delimiter
and we have now three new columns which
have got added to our existing data
which was already filtered and we have
done some splitting up of data by
creating a duplicate and then renaming
it right so if you
go and look at your Transformations now
if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID which I
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on year
right now we have the year field or
order date field here you have the ship
date right but then might be you want to
just aggregate based on year you don't
want to really spend time in aggregating
or extracting the month and day and so
on so my these three columns can be
useful now what I can also do is I can
merge The Columns if I want so we have
split the columns but what I can do is I
can say select select select
so using your control and now do a right
click so you should have an option
called merge columns right now this is
something which is we would want to
merge so let's say merge columns and
let's say do you want to keep a
separator so yes I want to keep a
separator but might be this time I will
give my separator is a
uh colon and then what is the merge
column name you want to create so let's
call it something like
um
order
okay
uh here and then let's call it num
right so sometimes renaming the fields
to a name which makes more sense or
based on your naming convention is good
so let's do a merge and now what I have
done is I have done merging of those
columns so
I split the data I merge The Columns and
now if you see my
The Columns which I had created those
columns are gone because you did a merge
you did a merge and now you have the
fields which are either
uh earlier you had
something which is separated by a
hyphen and here you have something which
is separated by colon right now anytime
if you want you can
unmerge this by removing this step right
and you can get rid of this merge column
so if for example I would do that
so
I have my data back right I have my data
back so what we could have done is we
can select this
okay and then what we can do is like
what we did earlier so you can
basically go for
removing the columns okay you can do a
merge column okay you can select one by
one and create duplicate of those and
then you can merge them right so all the
possible options are there so you can
the best option would be to create a
duplicate of these columns and then
basically merge them as per your
convenience so might be you can say
order IDs and order number is the
pairing what you want here is something
which you don't want right because we
already have the date field so I can
basically say remove
and this one is gone now I will select
this and this and let's go for merge
columns and I want to give a separator
which is
might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a
symbol and then what do you want to call
it so let's say order
specs
okay
right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the year into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order specs
right now this is some simple
Transformations what we are doing here
we are seeing the data which we have
okay now what I can do is I can
basically first apply these changes
so that all my changes what I have done
are applied right now once these changes
are done we can basically go ahead and
save this file so I can just say save I
can go for save as I have different
other options so
if you would want to perform keep
performing your transformation then you
can just do this you can add a column
you can view the data so for now our
Transformations are good enough and what
we can do is we can basically
go back to home we can do a close and
apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been transformed
so we have ordered specs here that's
good we did not do any filtering or
we have the filter left here which
basically tells me that there are these
different fields we have not removed
them but what we are doing is we are
just applying a filter to choose copiers
and Laser Printers
so that's what we have here and this is
good enough now what I can do is once
this is done I can basically save it
so I would want to call it some kind of
report if you would want to create okay
so let's call it
as uh
let's say second
report
and here I will say
country
and Technology
specific info
let's save it
and now basically I have saved my data
so what you can do is you can go for
creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that's what you want to do if you want
to go for visualization because right
now what we are seeing is we have a lot
of data here we have a lot of data here
it shows me there are these
tables or data sets which we have worked
on that shows me
here in the models but there is no
relationship with them if you're going
to visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here now based on the data what
we transformed if you see we have order
specs
right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
ship date you have aggregated columns
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this and for that
what I can do is let's go for ship mode
now this is something what we have so we
are in this data field
now we have this transform so let's go
back to Transformer game
and let's choose our orders so that's
the data we have and now if you see here
this is
you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode
so here you have an option called Group
by so I can select this I can go in here
I can basically work on okay get rid of
duplicate values but that's not what we
want to do you want to do a group by so
as I said you can do a group by from
here or you can choose from the
transform option above and you can do a
group by so let's do a group by
now
how do you want to group the data so I'm
saying I want to group the data here
based on shipping mode
or
which is the other column you want to
use to do a group by so let's go for
shipping mode and what is the new column
name right so we want to basically find
out
that you want to go for ship mode but
that's not enough I mean I can do a ship
mode and I can do a grouping by but you
want to just count the rows no that's
not what we want to do so let's go to
Advanced so ship mode is fine so that's
your grouping right but then what we
also want to do is we want to do a
grouping based on
say sales so here for example let's go
for sales
okay and what should we call this so
might be we can say shipment
wise
sales whatever you would want to call so
you can basically get the operation do
you want to really count the rows no we
want to basically do a summing or we
want to might be find out an average
price right so let's do a sum
okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on
say for example sales
so this is what I'm going to use for
getting a count of the sales now
grouping by might be we will change this
instead of uh
instead of sales we are using a ship
mode what we can also do is let's go for
a segment
and that would be valid grouping so it
will take a combination of shift mode
segmenting group the data based on that
and then get me the sales which is
which is basically let's call it
shipment wise sales
so it gets a sum so let's do a okay
and that's my more relevant data which
I'm looking at so I'm looking at the
ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically having
a combination of two Fields so that has
to be unique and your grouping is done
based on that so now you are looking at
the sales wise and this is something as
an important information what we have so
we have done some transformation and
what you can do is
you can use other ways like you can use
pivot to get individual values from it
you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is instead of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do a paste and I have
done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping by
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based on your segment and
based on the sales so that's what we are
looking for so let's go for the ship
mode and
we go for group by
and here you would want to go for
advanced the ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment
wise sales
so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say okay
and that basically gives you the data
here now
what we have is we have the resultant
data based on the data which is coming
in from here we did the same thing just
one minute back but we worked on the
original data set so what I did was I
created a copy and now I'm working on
this one so I'll say close and apply
and now we are back to our desktop so it
is applying these changes where we have
done some Transformations we have done
some grouping by and what we can do is
once we have the data here we get
anytime look at our data sets or tables
so this is my original one if you see
now I have order summarized I can just
pull out this information I basically
have my returns which we have not really
touched and we have the scientists so we
have all the four data sets here now
what we can also do is let's look into
order summarized and we just have this
data here so this is fine and you can
continue working on this you can
basically merge columns from two
different data sets and then you can get
the merged column
and you can rename it so you can
obviously do that you can basically do a
uncheck
whenever you are working on these data
sets so what you can do is
if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here
and say I want to do some transformation
on it so how did we do it we just did a
transform
and you can go back to transform so you
have this data here and
the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will be
loaded and they will still be available
but this will not affect your
it will not affect your original one so
for example let's say cop p and let's go
in here I will do a paste let's say
orders
oh I did a paste I need to rename this
so let's do renaming let's say orders
and here I will say summarized
and I will say us
so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have here
where's my country so let's look for
country
yeah and let's look for Country so here
I will go for only United States
okay that's what I'm interested in and
then I can choose well I am interested
in just Central us
so I can basically go for just the
central U.S and I can get rid of all of
these
so now I should have only Central us
data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visualization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product name so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have let's
uh let's not restrict it to region
region would then reduce my data but
that's good enough for us I can just say
no
I'm clearing off this filter I'm still
looking at United States but I want to
look at all the regions yeah whatever we
would be interested in category and
that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data we have copies and machines
right and we can basically keep this now
this is fine I can apply the changes
I can apply the changes based on this
one
and what I can do is I can just say for
now apply
so that's going to apply all the changes
which you have done in orders or summary
or the new one right and what I can do
is now I can choose order and I can say
don't enable this in load
so it says disabling load will remove
the table from the report and any
visuals that use its columns will be
broken we are not creating any visuals
as of now the table will be removed so
that's fine
and now I will say close and apply
so what happens is you are loading the
data based on the changes okay now you
have your
order summarized you have returns you
have scientists but you basically do not
have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so I only have this one I only
have this one and
you have returns you have scientist you
don't have the orders column right now
that particular data set was not loaded
at all because we did not choose that to
be loaded right now while I'm in this
orders which is
let's see here and actually you can drag
in yeah so you have order summary and
this has basically kind of data which
I'm looking for so I really don't need
the orders table so you can do it in
steps and you can aggregate this you can
have aggregated data you can have all
the data which is filtered transformed
grouped by and then basically just load
it and the original data set which you
used that's no more being loaded here
now at any point of time if I really
want
I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue working on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joins right joins you have inner joints
outer joins so you can always do that
you can take two different data sets
might be I'm interested in taking the
orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment wise
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the values
these have the values say for example
the segment column here and the segment
column here can really be used to join
these two tables so if I create a
relationship or if I create a join I can
basically merge the data so this is how
you work on data we will also see some
more examples on might be modeling the
data using some Expressions to work on
the data so we already looked at
creating a report
selecting particular fields and then
publishing the report onto your power bi
service now this is the report which we
had created which says State order ID
sales and then I also added this
returned field and that was basically by
creating a relationship between order
and returns which we can also have a
look in model so this is the
relationship which is created if you
just place your cursor here it tells me
that we have a relationship between
order ID of returns and Order ID of
orders and that basically allows me to
join the data bring it in my one report
now this is basically your data sources
you can look at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you your
report now what we can also do is we can
make it interesting now we would not
want to scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order I D which was returned now
I can do a sorting I can filter out what
I can also do is I can use this option
which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a field which has no value how do
we do that so basically I can drag and
drop the returned
here as a field which comes from returns
now that basically shows me only the
value as yes but I do know that there is
there are some fields which are blank
now how do I add filter to this so I can
click on this one and then I can click
on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes or you
have the blank field for returned so
what we can do is we can select yes you
will see only
the orders and their IDs and sales where
the products were returned so that gives
me hundred eight thousand one one eight
and I can select blank so that will
basically get me all the orders or
products which were not returned now
this is a simple way wherein I can add a
filter to or a slicer to my report to
basically give viewers a choice of uh
selecting different fields and you can
add any number of slicers you can
basically say I would want particular
kind of information so for example if I
go into orders and we know we have the
state now I do have the state
information here and basically I can if
I would be interested I could filter
this out in my report itself I can sort
it I can look it in a different order
what I can also do is how about bringing
in state here and basically dragging it
here so that gives me the state option
it is giving me a visual which is
basically giving me a geographic
location of all these points so yes that
can be good what I can also do is I can
keep this which basically shows me the
state map might be it can be useful you
can zoom in you can zoom out you can
look at specific information here you
can drag and drop here so that's fine
what I can also do is I can again take
the state and bring it here
and that basically can be instead of my
map I can go for slicer so that gives me
all the values here and which basically
allows users to choose the fields or the
states which you would be interested in
looking at so for example if somebody is
interested in looking at the data for
Georgia just select this one and you see
the map automatically shows you where in
the map that's the place and it shows me
all the sales for Georgia State now I
can also basically select yes and that
shows me which were the orders which
were basically returned so that gives me
a quick overview of statewise what is
the geographical location if the orders
were returned or maybe I can just click
on blank and it shows me the
non-returned orders I can again go here
and uncheck the Georgie option and that
shows me all the states now once you
have done this this looks like a
comprehensive report which can be useful
for the viewers for your management team
and so on so we can just do a save and
that basically is saving my report so I
have this report now what if I publish
this report so I can just do a publish
and when I publish it says okay
workspace so let's say select
and then it says replacing this data set
may impact two reports you already have
a data set named by this one view the
impact I would say replace or I will say
view impact so that basically takes me
to the power bi service because
sometimes we may have some reports which
we have already uploaded and updating an
existing report might basically affect
my existing report so it basically shows
me the impact analysis it shows me one
workspace there are two reports they are
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here and let's look into my
power bi so go back to your desktop and
I'll say no I don't want to replace so
click on cancel so I do not want to
publish it or it might be what I can do
is I can try saving it as a different
report so let's say save as
and now I will basically say
additional
filters
okay let's save it
so now you see the name on the top
changes to additional filters and now
it's saved to publish this and now I can
go ahead and publish it select your
workspace
and basically it says this is the report
being published with our additional
filters with a map which gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my power bi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and maybe it's a good
an option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of power bi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built
now once the insights are ready it will
let you know what we can also do is we
can come in here click on
view data set
so you see now it shows your additional
filters and here you have option where
it should be showing your report so
let's say View and view is fine so
and if it doesn't show up sometimes it
might breaking taking time for
refreshing so you can always go here and
then you can click on your report
and that should get populated
so this is the report these are the
filters which I have gives me an option
of choosing all the states and basically
allows me to edit the report and look at
all the information here meanwhile we
can see here it is still trying to
gather some insights from the data and
now you see there are some insights here
so it says sales which is coming up and
a subset of your data was analyzed and
the following insights were found so
you're looking at sales by ship mode so
it says standard class second class
first class and same day so there were
different shipping modes in our data and
that's what it shows me the sales which
one had the majority it shows me the
profit so which city or state had more
profit so New York City has noticeable
more profits here average by shipping
cost by sub categories so there are
these different subcategories which we
can look at such as copiers and machines
have noticeably more shipping cost
profit by product name
and you can basically look at the row ID
and quantity so this is where you're
looking at a regression analysis you're
looking at row ID and quantity so there
is a correlation between row ID and
quantity so these are two different
variables or fields which are related
you're looking row ID by category
the row ID so it says California has
noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a correlation again
between two different variables average
of shipping costs now we would have
taken a lot of time building all these
visualizations but Power bi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is what you
are interested in you can focus and look
for more information based on all the
fields it has given you good amount of
insights which will help anyone who is
looking at this particular report so
that's your quick insights here and we
have this information
now once you have this information this
is basically where you have your focus
mode so it says subset of your data was
analyzed following insights were found
you can
basically say download
and here you have other options which
allow you to work with your power bi so
let's look at this one so this is where
we have our report and we can continue
exploring it more
one more interesting feature which power
bi has other than having your insights
ready to use which is basically in your
workspace and you can basically use
these insights what we are looking at
various options here
and basically you have this option where
it says spin the visual if you are
interested in a particular Insight you
can always pin it which you can always
go back and look into what you can also
do is you can also click on edit report
here now that's a report which has
already been published
to your power bi service not yet shared
but that can be shared or that can be
subscribed now once you click on edit
report it has option of reading View
mobile layout you have basically an
option which says basically options for
navigating through the data set you can
go for how visuals on the canvas
interact with each other
you have all these options and one of
the good options is ask a question so
you can always click on ask a question
and that basically says
some suggestions now you can open this
and it says okay ask a question about
your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report has
only four Fields so it has State order
ID sales and returned with some filters
but what about you looking at how many
ship modes are there so it is already
looking at your data so if you click on
this one here and you can see what are
the different fields what we have and
you have ship date and ship mode so this
is one of the fields which it is showing
you to ask a question now what you can
do is you can say how many ship modes
are there let's click on that let's ask
this question it says four ship modes
and do you want to add this to report
yes you can you can let it be as it is
so you can basically keep this question
here and here you have an option the
visual is showing number of ship modes
when you place your cursor here if you
see here turn this q a result into a
standard Visual and let's do that and
basically it is saying number of ship
modes
right so now that's the power of your bi
power bi which has basically allowed you
to ask a question and quickly add a
visual to your report now what we can do
is we can basically save this or you can
say save as and give any of different
name so might be I'll just say save
because I would want to have this
information and the report is saved so
in this way you can basically not only
create smart visuals you can not only
relate
different data sources using data models
or relationships you can add maps you
can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say
[Music]
um
what is the
highest shipping
cost and that shows me some suggestions
let's select that and that shows me the
value
which is great and I can keep it as it
is I can basically convert this to a
visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and you would want to see the result
here might be you can move this
somewhere here
and that gives me some kind of question
which was asked and we can do a save
and that's my report which has been
saved in my bi service the data set is
still there you can basically go ahead
and share this
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on business intelligence
with buffer bi if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session or if you require the
