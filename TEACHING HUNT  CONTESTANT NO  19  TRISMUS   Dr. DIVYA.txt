hello everyone i am dr divya
maxillofacial surgeon from hyderabad so
today i am here to discuss about
christmas a condition which is
considered to be a common complication
of dendritic treatment
there are several factors which
predispose an individual to develop
christmas
ranging from modern disturbance of
trigeminal nerve to potentially
life-threatening conditions like hitting
us
now let's get into the presentation and
see what exactly is this christmas
what factors cause this and how do we
manage this condition
christmas is a condition that restricts
the normal mandibular moment
and function as a result of masticatory
muscle spasm
the word rismos is derived from the
greek word prismos
meaning gnashing and is defined as a
prolonged titanic spasm of the jaw
muscles
by which the normal opening of the mouth
is restricted
more recently the term christmas have
been used to describe
any restriction to mouth opening
including restrictions cursed by trauma
surgery or radiation the maximal
intensizer opening
of at least 35 mm is used as cutoff
point
to determine christmas and less than
five millimeters of
maximal energy incisor opening indicates
complete ankylosis
so roughly put the mouth opening should
permit a minimum of three fingers
when introduced sideways
now what is the normal mouth opening the
normal range of mouth opening varies
from patient to patient
within a range of 40 to 60 millimeters
and the later opening is
8 to twelve millimeters now mouth
opening of greater than thirty
millimeters
is considered to be light christmas if
the mouth opening is between fifteen to
thirty millimeters it is considered as
moderate and if it is less than fifteen
millimeters it is considered to be
severe christmas
a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of
the muscles of mastication
and the moments of the temporal
mandibular joint aids an understanding
of this clinical symptom
now let's get back to our anatomy and
recollect what are the muscles
which elevate the mandible that is what
are the muscles
that close the mandible so basically
there are three pair of jaw closing
muscles
these include ambassador temporalis
and the medial territory the powerful
masseter and the temporalis muscle
by this size and point of insertion
exert a strong closing force
the medial terror is also an earthquake
powerful muscle
which is inserted onto the internal
surface of the ramus of the mandible
and down to the angle now what about the
muscle that opens the mandible
lateral target is only muzzle of
mastication that is
assist in depressing the mandible that
is opening the jaw
it is also assisted by myelohyde
anterior belly of digastric
in your heart and infrahyoid muscles
the muscles of mastication can exert a
combined force of 100 to 300
pounds and those that open about 25
pounds that is
one pair of muscle should act against
three
strong three pair of strong muscles so
this relative weakness of opening
musculature is a prime factor in the
patient's inability to open the mouth
when pathology limiting the mandibular
motion exists
several conditions may predispose an
individual to develop
christmas the theology of christmas
can be divided into interactive causes
and extraterrecular causes
inter-articular causes
that is the factors which are present
within the temporal mandible joint
so these include ankylosis arthritis
and meniscus pathologies now coming to
the extra articular factors
that is the factors which are present
outside the joint
so these can be further divided as
infection
which could be odentogenic or
non-identogenic in origin
trauma dental treatment related
tmds that is temporary mangrove joint
disorders
tumors drug related
radiotherapy and chemotherapy congenital
and miscellaneous factors now let's look
at each factor in detail
the hallmark of masticatory space
infection is limited jaw opening
in case of infection the pain and the
limitation of opening are usually
progressive
the infections causing christmas may be
of an odentogenic or a
in nature orientogenic infections have
three major origins
like palpal periodontal and pericorona
the presence of an oral infection
particularly around an erupting
mandibular third molar is the most
common cause
the non-electrogenic infection such as
tonsillitis
tetanus meningitis pyrotenapsis and
brain abscess may also cause christmas
christmas can be the primary presenting
symptom in 50 to 75 percent of the
tittiness cases
there's a marked increased tone in the
central muscles with the superimposed
generalized spasm
in indigenous the spatula test a simple
bedside test to diagnose retinas
the posterior pharyngeal wall is touched
with the spatula in this test
and if it is positive a reflex spasm of
the masseter occurs
instead of the normal gag reflex
drama fractures particularly those of
the mandible may cause limited jaw
opening depending upon the type of
injury the direction of the
dramatic force the mandible tend to
fracture
at different locations so producing
mandible hypermobility
like in case of mandibular condylar
fracture
and this another relatively rare cause
of christmas in general practices trauma
for zygomatic arch or zmc
so these fractured segments they overlap
and interfere with the movement of the
coronoid process
now christmas related to dental
procedure
christmas the well-recognized potential
complication of
inferior alveolar nerve block and is
usually attributed to inaccurate
positioning of the needle
when giving the block if you can
remember the landmarks of ian block
the and the path of needle during
insertion the needle should be placed in
the pterygoid space
which is bound by internal oblique ridge
of the mandible on the lateral side
and terrible mandelbrot roughly on the
medial side
now whenever the muscle is accidentally
penetrated
or the virus is penetrated uh it leads
to bleeding
and this bleeding is all leads to
hematoma
formation and this hematoma it gets
organized
and finally leading into fibrosis in the
muscle
so post injection christmas is related
to tearing of mass
masticatory muscle by penetration of the
needle during insertion to the muscle
and the most commonly involved muscle in
case of iron
block is medial terracotta so good
injection technique by staying lateral
to the terigo mandible raphe during
penetration
will avoid the medial thyroid muscle and
since this muscle lies
medial to rafi we should always be on to
the late
like we should be later with delga
mandible raphael
temporomandibular joint disorders the
two common types of tmd's that may
result in christmas
are myofascial pain and disc
displacement without reduction
the limited mouth opening is either
voluntarily induced because of the pain
or because the true locking as a result
of internal displacement of the disc
tumors and the oral malignancies
christmas is cited as a very common
finding in pharyngeal
parapharyngeal space tumors and
christmas is frequently seen in patients
suffering from malignant tumors of head
and neck
thyroclinical and radiographic
examination must be performed to rule
out the neoplastic possibilities
oral submucous fibrosis is a
precancerous condition commonly seen
in people from indian subcontinent this
causes blanching of mucosa and can
affect the speech by restricting the
tongue and the soft palate moments
the exact etiology is unknown but it is
most commonly attributed to
bitterness showing there is a
classification of
oral submucous fibrosis based on the
inter incisal distance
where in group a is a mouth opening
greater than 35 millimeters
and group b include the mouth opening is
if it is between 30 and 35 millimeters
in group c if it is between 20 and 30
millimeters and group d if it is less
than 20 millimeters
some drugs are capable of causing
christmas a secondary effect
like succinylcholine phenothyazin
tricyclinic
antidepressants and metaglobrimide are
more common hence it is very essential
to take a proper medical and drug
history in patients presenting to us
with christmas
christmas and oncology radiotherapy is
one of the major treatment modalities
used for management of head and neck
malignancies
it can be used as a primary therapy for
many
like early stage malignancies or as an
adjuvant therapy following surgical
resection or in conjunction with
concurrent ct
for later stage and unresettable and
hidden malignancies
so christmas in oral oncology is mainly
because of radiotherapy-induced fibrotic
changes of the muscles of masturbation
or in case of osmf and less often
inferential infections and oral mucosal
disorders now when the muscle of
mastication are within the field of
radiation
fibrosis may result and lead to and
christmas
reducing the range of movement the mouth
opening after radiotherapy decreases on
an average by 18 to 32 percent
compared to the mouth opening prior to
radiation therapy so doses
ursula's 15 diary resulted in functional
impairment
there are certain syndromes associated
with uh christmas
so these include christmas pseudocam
camtodactyly syndrome
hemifacial microsomia and gorgeous
disease
there are a few miscellaneous causes
wherein we can find
christmas like hysterical christmas it
refers to a muscular limitation that is
a consequence of psychological trauma
and the presentations are varied and
include paralysis
blindness anesthesia anorexia and
vomiting
there is another condition called as
myositis ossificate it is a rate this is
where we find heterotopic ossification
in the muscle or the soft tissue
following any trauma
christmas can dramatically affect the
quality of the life
in a variety of ways which include
poor oral hygiene the complication of
condition associated with head and neck
cancer treatments
this reduced access for oral examination
dental procedure
patient components of dysphagia
aspiration and related complications
which is half of with malnutrition there
is decreased access for medical
procedures
including intubation inability to use
dentures
or oral and pharyngeal prosthesis
speech difference and airway compromise
now how do we manage or how do we treat
the patient with christmas
treatment of christmas varies depending
on the etiological factors
supportive measures and rehabilitation
are the main line of treatment for
tristans
how do we manage a patient with
christmas following dental treatment
some difficulty in opening the jaw on
the day following dental treatment in
which a psc or ian block was
administered is frequently encountered
so whenever patient complains with mild
pain and disc
dysfunction an appointment for
examination should be arranged and in
interim the practitioner should
prescribe
a heat therapy that is placing of hot
moist towels in the affected site for 15
to 20 minutes
every hour energy 6 aspirin is usually
adequate and its anti-inflammatory
properties are also beneficial
patients should be advised to have soft
diet and if required
prescribe muscle relaxant so this
manages the initial phase of muscle
spasm
now when the acute phase is completed
the patient should be advised to
initiate physiotherapy
for opening and closing the jars and to
perform later exertions of the mandible
for five minutes every three to four
hours
sugarless chewing gum is another means
of providing later moment to the tempura
mandible joint
if pain and dysfunction continue
unabated beyond 48 hours that is there
is no improvement
the possibility of infection should be
considered and the antibiotic should be
added to the treatment regimen and
continued for seven days
christmas and oncology exercises are
frequently proposed to prevent
or treat christmas including the active
range of
motion exercises combined with passive
range of motion exercises
so traditionally mouth opening using
finger resistor exercises
mouth guides and tongue depressors were
used now currently there are several
commercially available devices
that keeps the mouth open in a graded
manner and these include
the rubber plugs wooden tongue blades
terabyte exercises
and dynamic bite openers
terabyte is a therapeutic patient
control mouth opening device
which has got two mouthpieces that are
inserted between the teeth of the upper
and lower jaw
when the pressure is applied on the
handles the mouthpiece opens
so this indirectly is putting pressure
on the jaw in the opposite direction
this is a dynamic splint trismus system
it is a therapeutic mouth opening device
and it incorporates a custom mouthpiece
to accommodate the partial of fully
dangerous jaws
the patient can use the device in a
handheld manner or can just attach the
counterbalance bars
so this provides a hands-free therapy
now the this is found to be effective in
reducing the cancer therapy induced
christmas
and the biomechanical modality of this
is with a low
load and prolonged duration stretch was
attributed to the success in reducing
contracture
this provides sustained tension on
affected joints to allow for a gradual
increase in the range of
motion the proper placement of this
device is a key
to success threaded tapered screw
this up lens is made up of acrylic resin
and it is one of the inexpensive easily
available device
so this appliance can be placed inside
the mouth of the patient between the
posterior teeth
and with gradual turns the maxillary
mandible teeth are spread apart
so this appliance provides force that
can be controlled by the patient
the only disadvantage is that it is not
used for dangerous patients
pythoxanthin derivative and its
applications oncology is promising
studies have shown that pentoxiphylline
administered to patients with
radiotherapy induced fibrosis
has resulted in a significant increase
in the mandibular range of motion
pentoxipharyn also influences cytokine
mediated inflammation
so coming to surgical aspect of
management of christmas
now although there are no guidelines
available for the surgical treatment of
christmas
it is usually used when conservative
treatment modalities do not improve the
outcome
an apparent severity of christmas
leading to functional disability
surgery has been used in severe drismas
in osmf
by complete release of fibrotic tissue
with coronoidectomy and placement
interpositional grafts so the grafts
used have been divided into local flaps
and distant flaps
local flaps are the ones where in the
donor sides are present in the head and
neck region
and they transpose to the oral cavity by
medical attachments
the distant flaps include free flaps
with av anastomosis from donor sites in
the arm and thigh
local flaps can further be divided into
intraoral and extraordinary intraoral
flaps like a tongue flap or palatal
island flap can be used
an extraordinary flaps like nasolabial
flap or temporalis facial flap can be
used
now the main disadvantage of using
intraoral flap or the main limitation
for using intraoral flap in osmf is that
usually whenever the patient presents to
us with osmf
the complete oral cavity might have been
involved by the disease
so we need to make sure that whatever
donor site we are choosing should be
free of the disease
this is the main advantage of using an
external flap for reconstruction in
cases like these
buckle fat pad buckle fat pad as
interpositional graft is one of the most
popular technique in the treatment of
oral submucous fibrosis
the easy access of the buccal fat tissue
in close proximity to surgical site
its volume and its non-involvement in
the disease condition
make it an ideal choice the donor site
in addition the relative less mobility
associated with the procedure
and the simplicity of the technique of
harvesting the fat tissue
justifies its popularity now major
hurdles
included are the limited reach of flap
for coverage of the antenna region of
the oral cavity
the chances of damage of the parroted
papilla and the duct during harvesting
and secondary infection in the
post-operative phases
coverage of the fat tissue with collagen
membrane and split skin grafts have also
been advocated
so so that the this problem can be
circumvent
distant flaps now the free flaps serve
the advantage of secondary donor areas
unaffected by the local disease process
and there is no anatomical restriction
in the oral region
and this abundance of virtually all
forms of tissue layer
whether if you it is a muscle bone etc
now the radial forearm flap and the
anterior lateral thigh flap are the
commonly used ones
the high expertise high operating cost
and potential failure of anastomosis are
the prominent drawbacks of this distant
flaps
radial forearm flap the technique of
bilateral small free radial forearm flap
has a merit of transferring a
well vascular skin flap thus the
prevention of first
scar contracture and there is definitely
a decrease in the recurrence of
christmas
however there are also few disadvantages
with this technique
so we are we use two flaps here that is
two instances of microsurgery are
required
and the procedure is time consuming and
technically demanding
and also it involves two forearm donor
site
thus you're sacrificing the bilateral
radial arteries
recently the use of anterior lateral
thigh flap has gained popularity for
hedonic
reconstruction the popularity of this is
because of the long vascular pedicle
large skin pattern and decreased
operative time with the toady approach
and finally to summarize christmas is
not considered disease or injury
but rather more the result and one of
the concluding sequently
which follows after the active stages
are heat
a systematic approach using a
disciplined and organized thought
process
is more likely to yield an accurate
diagnosis
for the clinician to diagnose christmas
properly he or she must be able to
determine the cause from a variety of
possibilities
the treatment objectives are to remove
edema
soften and stretch the fibrous tissue
increase the range of joint motion
restore the circulatory efficiency and
increase the muscle strength
and retain the muscular dexterity

presentation i hope you find this
presentation useful and if you have any
