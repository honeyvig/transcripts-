has been the best program that I could
have had and it was a truly enriching
and profoundly fulfilling experience
overall it's an excellent program by
itself some of the features of this
program that I really liked first was
the accessibility that the program is
available on all devices web mobile the
second feature I really liked is the
comprehensive training material you have
books references and the third best
thing about this is the labs the
practice Labs that you can access from
anywhere about leveraging the knowledge
that I have learned in this program I've
already started applying it we are
working in the areas of development test
