did you land that interview call you had
been looking forward to
you will be happy to know that you
belong to the top two person candidates
who applied for the job as robert meyer
president of job market experts reveals
that ninety percent of the job seekers
are eliminated at the initial resume
screening and only two percent of the
candidates make it to the interview
so now that you have backed the coveted
interview
how do you nail it
before you start with the prep work you
need to understand what questions to
expect during the interview
being prepared with your responses well
in advance can give you a leg up in the
process
hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting session from simplyrun
in this session we will be discussing
the tcs interview process and question
and answers
so without any further ado let's get
started with the process
data consultancy services is a good
platform to begin your professional
career as a new employee
it provides a great workplace for the
freshers and good ambiance conductive to
individual
it holds a mass recruiting procedure
every year to find the employees for the
positions
process has four rounds they are
tcs and qt technical round managerial
round and hr round
first round tcs nqt
the first round of tcs recruitment
process is tcs nqt
which is considered as one of the most
difficult stages of the procedure it is
an ability test that evaluates a
candidate's ability and skills
tcs and qt exams are offered both online
and in person at tcs ion authorized exam
centers
the test has five sections
namely numerical ability verbal
reasoning ability programming logic and
coding
next up second round
which is a technical round
this is the most challenging stage of
the hiring process
so do your best to prepare for it
the focus of the entire interview
process will be on your technical
knowledge biography and primary projects
the technical round of the tcs interview
which is a face-to-face consists of
questions designed to assess the
candidate's knowledge of data structures
and algorithm database management
operating systems networking
oops concepts and a programming language
of your choice
there is a considerable chance you will
be asked to write some code on pen and
paper
third round manager alarm
the manager along is handled by a panel
of senior members
this is also a face-to-face interview
round
this round may consist entirely on your
technical questions and combination of
technical and managerial questions
the majority of the questions are based
on the profile for which you are being
interviewed
you should be up to date on any new
technologies or software required for
that position
you may also be asked questions based on
your actions to assess your thinking
style you could be put under pressure to
see how you react
your series achievements may be
questions and you may have to defend
them
you may be questioned on your previous
working experience about your objective
motivation for joining tcs and other
similar topics
the fourth and the final round hr round
this is the last stage of the hiring
process
candidates are expected to be adaptable
yet this phase allows for negotiation
most candidates believe that
the hr interview is simple but keep in
mind that a pure hr interview can
jeopardize your chances of receiving the
job
even if you have cleared all the other
hurdles aptitude test technical round
etc the goal is to maintain a pleasant
and confident demeanor
interviews can be long and tedious so
remember to smile
now let's have a look at interpretations
first up
who is eligible for tcs nqt
the answer for this question is
any student with any degree are allowed
for the tcs and qt
pressures and people with less than two
years of work related experience can
also apply for this test
final year and pre-final undergraduates
and diploma students are eligible for
this application
next up to the next question
what is bfs
and the answer for this question is
breadth first search is an algorithm for
searching a tree data structure for a
node which satisfies the given property
it starts at the tree's root and
explores all the nodes of the trees at
the present depth prior to moving on to
the nodes at the next depth level
the extra memory should be needed to
keep track of the child nodes that were
encountered but not explored
and the next question on the list is
what is jdk
the answer for this question would be
the java development kit is the
distribution of java technology by
oracle corporation
it implements the java language
specifications and java virtual machine
specification that provides the standard
edition of the java application
programming interface
next up is how to split strings in java
the answer for this question
is this program
in the first line we are defining a
string str which is simply run with an
extra e
in the next line we are creating another
string arr of str which will then use
the split function to split the string
in two parts at the position e in the
next line we are using a for loop to
print out both the strings
now let's move on to next question
next question is to explain the swapping
of two numbers without using the third
variable
we can use this code to represent that
in the first line we are defining a is
equals to 2 and b is equals 4.
then we will write a code to swap the
values of a and b
first we will add a and b and store it
in a
that means now our value of a is 6 and b
is equal to 4. in the next line we will
change the value of b and subtract the
value of b from a and store it in b
so now the a is goes to 6 and b is
equals to 2.
now we will change the value of a by
subtracting b from it so now a will be
equals to four and b will be equals to
two
hence we have swapped the value of a and
b
now next up
question number six
dislocation to write a program to check
palindrome
we can use the below code to check
if the given number is palindrome or not
first we will declare some variables
like n
number reversed equals to 0 and
remainder
we will first take value for n which
will be the number we have to find if
it's palindrome or not
then we will store the value of n in
variable number
now we will write a while loop which
will run until n becomes 0.
now we will store the
last digit of the n in the remainder
we can do that by using n modulus 10.
then in the next line we are multiplying
reversed by 10 where since reverse was 0
so it will become again 0 and add
reminder to it so now the reverse store
the last digit of the number
now we will divide the original number n
by 10
so the last digit will be removed from
the original n number
we will repeat this process until the
number n is reversed
now we will check if the variable number
and the variable reversed are equal or
not if they are equal then yes it is a
palindrome and if not that it is not a
palindrome
let's move on to next question
what is recursion
the answer for the question is
recursion is a method of solving a
problem where the solution depends on
solutions
to smaller instances of the same problem
such problems can be generally be solved
by iteration but this needs to identify
and index the smaller instances of
programming time
recursive solves recursive problems by
using functions that call themselves
from within their own code
next question what is database
the answer for the question is the
database management system
is the software that interacts with end
users applications and database itself
to capture and analyze the data
the dbms software additionally
encompasses the core facilities provided
to administer the database
the sum total of the database the dbms
and associate applications can be
referred to as a database system
often the term database is also used
loosely to refer to any of the dbms the
database systems and an application
associated with the database
next up what is jvm a java virtual
machine is a virtual machine that
enables a computer to run java programs
as well as programs written in other
languages
that are also compiled to java byte code
the jvm is detailed by specification
that formally describes what is required
in a jvm
having a specification ensures
interoperability of java programs across
different implementations so that
program authors using the jdk need not
worry about eds interests
of the underlying hardware platforms
the next question on the list is
explain the use of join function in
python
the join function is used to define a
string method which basically returns a
string value
it is concatenated with an elements of
an iterable and provided a flexible way
to concatenate a string
these are the uses of join function
next up
we have to explain the use of break
statement
break statement is typically used to
terminate the execution of the current
loop
and also transfer control to outside of
the current statement
next up what is tuple
a tuple is a built-in data collection
type of python
it allows storing values in a sequence
manner
it uses open brackets rather than close
brackets to create a tuple
it is not possible to remove any
elements but can be found in the tuple
next up we have to mention different
types of operators in python
first up arithmetic operators relational
operators assignment operators logical
operators membership operators identity
operators and bitwise operators
these are the few operators in python
next up what is the use of dcl language
dcl or data control language allows
access and permission management to the
database
it is also the subset of the database
that decide what part of the database
should be accessed by which user
dcl mainly includes two commands grant
and revoke
next up which is more important money or
work
in my point of view the work is more
important to me
once we achieve and over perform the
target and help to increase the growth
of the company
then definitely money will follow us
and this is how we should answer this
question
next up why should we hire you
the answer for the question should be as
a fresher i'm looking for an opportunity
to prove my ability
if i'll be the part of this company i
will put all my efforts and strengths to
make this company reach great
achievements and if you hire me i will
get an opportunity to build my
professional experience to your company
and this kind of answer will make a good
impression on the interviewer
next question what is dbms the answer
for this question is
dbms stands for database management
system
it is a software program that works as
an interface between database and end
user
dbms provides the power to manage the
data the database engine and the
database schema facilitate the
organization and manipulation of data
using a simple query
and the next question in the list is
list some features of javascript
and the answer should be
interpreted programming language
it is lightweight complementary to java
it is an open source it is
cross-platform
and complementary to html
the next question in the list is
we have to mention the use of help
function and dir function in python
help function
the help function is used to display the
documentation string and facilitate to
see the help related to module
keywords and attributes
the dir function is used to display the
defined symbols
and this is how we use these two
functions in python
the next question is what is meant by
dom
dom is basically stands for document
object model
it represents the html document and can
be used to access and change the content
of html
next up we have to list few advantages
of packages in java
the answer for the question should be
packages in java avoids the name clashes
packages in java also provides easier
access control
it is easier to locate the related
classes using packages in java
and these are the few advantages of
packages in java
the next question on the list is
we have to list the few advantages of
dbms
there are few advantages of dbms like it
provides multiple user interfaces
redundancy control
ensure data consistency restriction for
unauthorized access easy accessibility
provide backup and recovery enforces
integrity constraints
next up we have to mention oops concepts
in c plus
there are various oops concepts in c
plus for us like class
object data binding inheritance
encapsulation abstraction and
polymorphism
next up
what is a clustered index in sql
a clustered index is a table where the
data for the row are stored
it also determines the order of the
table data based on the key values that
are stored in only one direction
and the next question on the list is
what is the purpose of a default
constructor in java
the purpose of the default constructor
in java is to assign the default value
to this object
java compiler creates a default
constructor implicitly if there is no
constructor present in class
next up
is it possible to overload the
constructor
the answer for the question is the
constructors can be overloaded by
changing the data type of the parameters
or by changing the number of arguments
accepted by the constructor
what is the static variable
static variable is used to refer to the
property of all objects
like the name of employees name of
students etc
static variables gets memory allocated
only once
and the next question is is it possible
to execute a program without the main
function
the answer is no it is not possible ever
since jdk 1.7 came out
but before jdk 1.7 using the static
block it was possible to execute without
the main method
next question what are the functions in
python
a function is a block of code that is
executed only when the function is
called
to define a function in python the def
keyword is used
next up
why do lambda forms in python do not
have the statements
lambda forms in python do not have the
statement because it is used to make the
new function object and return them in
the runtime
next up what is inheritance
inheritance is a mechanism of basing an
object or class upon another object a
class retaining a similar implementation
also defined as deriving new classes
which is subclasses from existing ones
such as super class or base class
and then forming them into an hierarchy
of classes
in most class-based object oriented
languages
an object created through inheritance
child object acquires all the properties
of the behaviors
of the parent objects
and the exception of constructor and
destructor
overloaded operators and
trend functions of the base class
the next question on the list is
what are the different data types
present in javascript
there are only two types of data types
present in javascript
primitive data types and non-primitive
data types
next up we have to list the types of
data structure
data structures are divided into two
types
they are either linear or non-linear
data structures
next up
which data structure is used to perform
recursion
usually stack data structure is used to
perform recursion due to its last and
first out nature
and the next question in the list is we
have to mention operations that can be
performed on stack
the operations performed on stack are
push pop and peak these are the three
operations performed on a stack
next question in the list is what is the
queue in data structure
a queue is an ordered list that enables
insert operations to be performed at one
end called here and delete operations to
be performed
at another end called front
the next question in the list is we have
to define polymorphism
polymorphism is a provision of a single
interface of entities of different types
or the use of single symbol to represent
multiple different types this concept is
borrowed from a principle in biology
where an organism or species can have
many different forms or stages
next up what is the output of this
example
here we are given an error a and we have
to find the element at index 4.
in the above question indexing starts
from 0 and the element present at the
fourth index is 9 so the output would be
9.
next up
what is the sql query to display the
current date
there is a built-in function in sql to
display the current timestamp which is
called getdate
next up why did you leave your last job
now this question can be answered like
this it is a career move for me i have
learned a lot from my last job and now
i'm looking for new challenges to gain a
new skill set
and the next question in the list is we
have to list the types of trees
the answer to the question would be
binary binary search tree a general tree
forest
expression tree and tournamentary next
up
how would you rate yourself on the scale
of one to five
the answer for this question should be
like this
i would rate myself above four out of
five because i would never like to think
that there should be a room left for
foot putting in more efforts and the
next question would be what are the uses
of super keyword
the answer is
it is used to invoke the immediate
parent class method
it is also used to defer the immediate
parent class instance variable
it can also be used to invoke immediate
parent class constructor
next question is what is a constraint
a constraint is used to specify the rule
or regulation that allows and restricts
what value or data
will be stored in the table it also
ensures data accuracy and integrity
inside the table
the next question in the list is what is
the structure
a structure is a user defined data type
that allows storing multiple types of
data into a single unit
the next question in the list is we have
to mention some sql commands
and the answer to the question is
single line commands and multi-line
commands
next up
what do you mean by method overloading
method overloading is a technique a
polymorphism that allows to create
multiple methods with the same name but
the different signature
next up what are the different types of
indices available in sql
the different types of indices available
in sql are
clustered index
non-clustered index unique index
composer index bitmap index
normal index p3 index and the function
based index
the next question in the list is
explain about top string in python
docstring is a string lateral that
occurs as the first statement in
function class module or method
definition
it also provides a better way to
associate the documentation
and the last question in the list is is
it possible to override the private
method
and the answer to the question should be
it is not possible to override the
private methods because the scope of the
private method is limited to the class
and it is not possible to access them
outside of the class
and this was all for today's session
