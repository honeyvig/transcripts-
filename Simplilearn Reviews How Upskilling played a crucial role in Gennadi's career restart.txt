work in Toronto Canada I started working
back in

and stuck to it until 200 11 when I
realized it was time for me to start my
own business in an entirely different
domain I had to close it down some time
back due to some personal reasons I
decided to reenter the corporate world
since my skills in marketing had become
obsolete I could not continue in that
field I decided to go with business

companies online I found that other
adtech platforms were focusing on data
analytics on the other hand simply learn
