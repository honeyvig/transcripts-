hello everyone welcome to this video by
simply learn today we will talk about
something super important for any team
which is prioritization techniques have
you ever felt overwhelmed jumping
between task without knowing which ones
really matter we've all been there but
don't worry there are ways to get
organized and focused for product
managers prioritization is one of the
most crucial skills it's the key part
for any product management interview
process as a product manager you must
prioritize features requirements and
task effectively to ensure your team
delivers maximum value to
customers let me tell you a story about
Samantha Who was the part of an agile
software team the projects were all over
the place they would work on one thing
then another with no clear plan missing
deadlines and frustrating clients that's
when Samantha's boss stepped in and
taught them about prioritization
deciding which tasks to do first and how
important they are he showed them
techniques like mosco for categorizing
task as must do should do could do Etc
and rice for scoring task based on
things like impact and effort using
these methods it was a total game
changer with mosco they identifi the
critical task and rice helped them to
prioritize the high impact work
efficiently suddenly projects were
organized work was delivered on time and
clients were happy as success spread
other teams started prioritizing it too
it boosted productivity across the whole
company Samantha felt proud to be the
part of making the work better from then
on prioritization became the core part
of how they operated for clarity and
focus on what mattered the most in this
video we will be covering what is
prioritization technique importance of
prioritization seven most popular
prioritization techniques like mosco

and in the pin comment so without any
further Ado let's get started at first
we will discuss what is prioritization
technique well prioritization technique
is a method used to determine the order
of importance of task activities or
elements within a project or process it
helps to identify what needs to be done
first what can wait and what may not
need to be done at all this technique
involves assessing the relative
significance urgency or impact of
different items and arranging them in
logical sequence or order of importance
by prioritizing effectively you can
allocate resources time and effort more
efficiently ensuring that you address
the most crucial aspects first to
achieve your goals
effectively but why is prioritizing so
important let's discuss the importance
of prioritization prioritization is
crucial for several reasons at first we
have limited resources every team has
limited resources whether time budget or
Manpower power granitization helps you
make most of these Resources by focusing
on the most important features first
then we have customer satisfaction by
delivering the most valuable features
first you can keep your customers happy
and engaged with your product moving on
to competitive advantage in today's
fastpaced market prioritization can give
you a Competitive Edge by allowing you
to quickly adapt to changing customer
needs and market trends now that we have
understood the importance of
prioritization let's dive into some of
the most popular prioritization
techniques the seven most popular
prioritization techniques we will
discuss today are as follows at first we
have mosco method moving on to Cano
model rise scoring model Eisenhower
Matrix value versus complexity Matrix
weighted short as job first and then at
last we have the walking skeleton method
let us start with the first method which
is the mosco method CCO is a simple way
to prioritize task and features when
working on a project it stands for must
should could and w't let me break it
down for you must these are the
essential features that absolutely have
to be included if you do not have these
the project will fail then should these
are the important features that you
should try to include but they are not
critical they would be great to have if
possible that's it then we have good
These are nice to have smaller
improvements or additions and leaving
them out want really impact the project
want these are the lowest rity items
that don't match the current needs or
goals you can safely leave these out for
now by separating everything into these
four buckets you can get super clear as
a team on the true priorities and make
sure your laser focused on checking
those must have boxes first so what are
the pros and cons of this method well
first off it's dead simple no complex
calculation or scoring systems are
needed you can prioritize a massive
backlog just by rapidly categorizing
each them it's also flexible since there
are no strict rules or timelines within
each bucket if a should item needs to be
deprioritized no problem just move it to
the cloud or want as needed and finally
the clear separation into these
Universal terms helps get everyone
developers design product managers and
stakeholders on the same page instantly
when it comes to understanding
priorities of course there are some
downsides too while it's easy to
categorize mosco doesn't give you a
specific implementation plan or sequence
to follow you have to figure that part
out separately you can also lack some
bigger pictures perspective by just
focusing on individual feature
priorities you might miss out the
Strategic product goals or overarching
business objectives and sometimes times
those category lines can get you a
little blurry in a certain feature a
must have or a should reasonable people
may disagree but in all mosco is a
simple yet powerful prioritization
technique especially for smaller
projects or titos Scopes where you need
priorities locked in quickly for bigger
more complex undertakings it can't be
your only prioritization method you
likely want to pair it up with something
more robust let me give you an example
of a product for for example a mobile
app for buying crypto the must would
include the ability to buy and sell
coins maintain a portfolio View and set
up payment methods those are the
essential no-brainer priorities shs
could be things like Advanced chart
analysis alerts price tracking and maybe
even integrated social trading features
they are really valuable but not
required for an MVP quid might include
custom valuable additions might include
captivating video controls or integrated
video calling features unnecessary
additions could be custom app themes
features user might dislike include
intrusive ads or sneaky premium upsells
by prioritizing based on this model you
can perfect the essential experience
before focusing on extra features themes
or watch list but doesn't break the core
experience and Wars for our initial
launch could be things like Advanced Tax
tools purchase of other asset classes or
automating trades with Bots just not
crucial priorities for the first version
by categorizing your backlog into Moscow
you can clearly see that you need to
prioritize those three must have items
above everything else to have a chance
at a successful initial launch the rest
can be prioritize separately within
their respective buckets so that's
moreco and nutshell a simple flexible
way to rapidly categorize your
priorities at a very first step next we
have the Cano model this one is all
about making sure that we are delivering
what our users want and care about it
splits features into a few buckets must
have onedimensional attractive total
time wasters and stuff that's all it
splits features into few buckets must
have onedimensional attractive total
time wasters and stuff to use it we
survey our potential users and get them
to categorize each feature based on how
it impacts their satisfaction the must
have are things that absolutely need for
the product to work at all
one-dimensional features are nice to
have that will please them if you get
them but disappoint if you don't
attractive features are awesome bonus
points that Delight users but it's no
big deal if they're missing indifferent
stuff doesn't really matter either way
and reverse features are things users
actively hate having the pros are that
it really highlights what matters most
to customers and ranks features by their
priorities the downsides is that it
ignores knows how difficult these
features are to get built it's also time
consuming to get that user feedback in
the first place this is all for the pros
and cons but when does it make sense to
use Cano well it's great for Branding
new products to get an initial reality
check before you start designing or for
validating prototypes and making sure
you're on the right track let me now
give you an example say like you're
building a dating app the must have
might be the ability to create profile
browse potential matches and s people
onedimensional could be stuff like
Advanced filtering super likes Etc
valuable additions might include
captivating video intros or integrated
video calling features unnecessary
additions could be custom map themes
features user might dislike include
intrusive ads or premium upsells by
prioritizing based on this model you can
ensure you perfect the essential
experience before focusing on extra
features next we got the rice model
which is little more number driven it
scores each feature by looking at four
factors the reach or number of users who
use it the impact it have your
confidence in its success and the
Manpower effort required to build it you
create each factor like impact which
could be massive high medium low or
minimal then you plug those ratings into
a formula to get a rise score higher
scores means higher priorities it scores
each feature by looking at four factors
the reach or number of users who use it
the impact it will have your confidence
in its success and the Manpower effort
required to build it you grade each
factor like impact which could be
massive high medium low or minimal then
you plug those ratings into a formula to
get a rice score higher scores means
higher priorities the pros of rice are
that it's comprehensive accounting for
user value technical cost risk and all
that good stuff and it uses metrics
instead of just gut feelings the cons
are that it can be calculation heavy for
every single feature and you might be
missing some of the data points for
brand new products now why does it make
sense to use rice it's awesome for
established products with good product
metrics and usage data to draw them
probably not the best approach for
totally fresh projects without any of
those numbers yet let's look at an
example of a yoga studio app for a new
class book feature reach could be around
25,000 monthly active users impact could
be massive like uh three on the scale
confidence in its success is medium to
high so maybe considering it to
80% and the engineering effort is
estimated around 3 person months
plugging into that formula the rise
scores come outs to be 25,000 into 3
multiplying by 0.8 which is around
20,000 you can then compare that against
the scores for other potential features
and prioritize accordingly moving on to
the next model which is the ishar Matrix
we don't have any complicated formulas
here just simply divide your task into
four buckets based on whether they are
Urgent important both or neither the
Urgent and important stuff goes into the
top prity bucket to be tackled
immediately important not urgent task go
in the scheduled bucket for later urgent
but unimportant fire drills get isolated
in their quadrant so you can properly
manage those and then at the last area
is for the total time wasters neither
urgent nor important the pros of this
method are it's very simple to use and
that it keeps you focused on the truly
important task that drive business value
the downside is that it's quite
subjective and qualitative no hard
numbers or scoring system is involved
you might be wondering why should we use
the ishar Matrix well it works great as
a personal time management framework or
as a first pass for broadly prioritizing
a bunch of task but most likely we want
to complement it with some other
techniques for a more rigorous product
prioritization let's look at an example
of a brand new e-commerce business the
Urgent and important stuff is setting up
the payments and shipping Integrations
would be a top priority important but
not urgently needed task are
implementing product filters or
recommendations would go into the
scheduled section redesigning the logo
just cause would be urgent but
unimportant busy work adding multi-
language support way down the line would
be the lowest priority section since
it's neither urgent nor crucial for the
launch next we've got the value versus
complexity Matrix this one is similar to
The ashar Matrix as it works with the
quadrants and dimensions but instead of
urgent and important it access value and
complexity with this one we map out each
feature based on its expected user or
business value on one axis and the
implementation complexity or engineering
effort level on the other we can use
whatever scoring or definitions make
sense but the goal is to prioritize
these high value low complexity items
first since they're easy wins really
valuable but High complex stuff comes
next after that is the low value low
complexity stuff we have the pros are
that it balances business user demands
with what's feasible to build looking at
add the value and effort and then we can
tweak the scoring criteria according to
our needs the conss are that it can
still be pretty subjective and may not
be ideal for massive code bases and
products but when does value versus
complexity work well it's perfect for
smaller teams and products early in the
life cycle when you need to rud Lesly
prioritize not the greatest for large
complex established products with crazy
requirements let me give you an example
of a productivity app a high value Lo
complexity features might be the code
ability to create an assigned task super
useful and not too hard to build a high
value High complexity one could be
integrated with all other major
productivity tools low value High
complexity might be some insane
reporting dashboard with a zillion
visualizations and the low value low
complexity stuff could be like smaller
tweaks custom emoji support Etc by
mapping those out you can prioritize the
top left quadrant of a major value ads
with minimal effort first all right we
are getting into some of the heavy
weights weight is shortest job first or
wsjf it uses some heavy duty
calculations but for a good reason for
each feature you estimate the cost delay
and how much you're losing by not having
that feature then you look at the job
durations or how long it will take to
implement you score the cost of delay
based on factors like user business
value how time sensitive it is whether
it reduces risk and so on higher scores
means higher cost of delays then you
divide the cost of delay by the job
duration to get wsjf score for each
feature the pros of wsjf are that its
detailed consistent calculation approach
and it optimizes for faster Roi with
limited resources the cons are that it
gets calculation heavy quickly and may
unintentionally deprioritize bigger
long-term projects use wsg JF when you
need to double down on those minimum
marketable features and quick high
impact wins don't rely on it too much
for full-blown product road maps though
let me show you an example adding an
offline more to the notes app take a
look at the cost of delay factors the
user business value is high maybe four
out of five since it's frequently
requested feature the time criticality
is also High 5x5 since it's the pain
point for the users and it reduces the
risk of potential data loss so say 4x5
for risk reduction adding those up the
total cost of delay is 30 if we
calculate the job duration to be around
2 months then the wsgf score comes out
to be 13 divided by 2 which is 6.5 you
would calculate scores that way out for
potential features too then prioritize
the ones with the highest scores like
offline mode first last but not the
least we've got the walking skeleton
method this one is all about identifying
and prioritizing only the bare minimum
core features needed to ship an initial
MVP which means minimum viable product
that basic working version of your
product the idea is to map out the
skeletal requirements that are critical
for the product to function and show its
core value proposition to users the pros
are that it enables fast prioritization
and MVP delivery we can get the market
quickly test our scores idea user
feedback and IDE rapidly from there
instead of over engineering and over
stuff version the cons are that it will
be shipping a pretty basic product
initially by cutting out tons of extra
features and there's a risk of taking it
too far and crippling the product if
you're not careful use the walking
skeleton method when we are focused on
delivering an MVP as soon as humanly
possible to validate your idea and get
moving don't use it as your sole
prioritization technique for full
product road maps though let me give you
an example of a brand new video
streaming service using the walking
skeleton approach the top priorities
would be ability to browse a video
catalog playing those videos back
smoothly use a login and subscription
functionality that's the core skeleton
everything else like recommendation
watch list parental controls would all
be delayed for future iterations after
getting the MVP out by hyper focusing
only on these critical first few steps
we can take an entirely new product from
concept to Market fast while still
shipping a functional experience to
start generating feedback and data let
us now discuss how to choose the right
prioritization technique when
considering the prioritization method
keep in mind the following criteria
Simplicity the simpler the method the
faster you can prioritize data driven
prioritization some methods rely more on
assumptions While others are based on
proven data balance between technology
constraints and business value some
methods focus more on customer value
While others consider technical
complexity best use case prioritizing
for an MVP might require different
techniques than prioritizing for a
mature product remember these methods
are not mutually exclusive and you can
combine them at different stages of your
product development life cycle so there
you have it a full breakdown of
different prioritization techniques from
the statistical model to the dead simple
matrices each one has its own pros and
cons and certain methods with make it
more sense than others depending on your
project stage complexity and data
avability so that's all for the video
