hmmm nice Concord in this video I'll be
talking about orbit and mid-face drama
coming to the first point which is very
important the most common type of
orbital fracture is blowout type of
fracture and the most common wall
involved in the orbit fracture is the
floor of the orbit and the thinnest wall
of the orbit is the medial wall and its
thickness is around 0.2 - 0.4 mm in the
shortest of all of the orbitals are
lower and the characteristic sign of
orbital fracture is post-traumatic
diplopia all these five points are very
important every point can come as an MC
Q so most common type of orbit fracture
is blue out most common wall involved in
the fracture is slower and the thinnest
wall is the medial wall and whose
thickness is 0.2 to 0.4 mm in the
shortest wall of the orbit is floor and
the characteristic sign of the orbital
fracture is forced to Matic diplopia so
this picture is showing blue out type of
fracture how does this globe type of
fracture occur when in larger object
larger than the size of the orbit hits
the orbit causes blowout type of
fracture see here the floor is gone in
the orbital content is herniating down
into the maxillary sinus so two theories
which are associated with blowout type
of fracture is Rhett repulsion theory
and buckling theory that repulsion
theory is also known as hydraulic theory
so you need to remember this the
theories associated with a blowout type
of fracture this picture is showing it
is an Emma and sorry it isn't ct-scan
coronal section showing hanging drop
sign which is in characteristic feature
of the blowout fracture of the orbit see
there is in communication between the
orbit and the maxillary sinus the
orbital contains our herniating down
the radiolucency of the maxillary sinus
is lost so there are other names for
blow or type of fracture it is also
called as white eye or trapdoor type of
fracture at this point is very important
that is the other names for blowout type
of fracture this white eye or trapdoor
type of fracture
what is this test this can come as an
image-based question this is for
seduction test to check for the
entrapment of the muscle what is done
here here the tendon of inferior rectus
is grasped and the eyeball is moved in
all direction to check for the
entrapment
so most common muscle that is entrapped
into a floor fracture that is lower type
of fracture is inferior rectus which can
cause diplopia that is post-traumatic
diplopia the classical Trier of blow or
type of fracture is diplopia intravital
numbness due to injury to the
infraorbital nerve and peri ocular
ecchymosis so you have to buy hardware
that is classical triad of blow or type
of fracture is diplopia intravital
numbness and parry ocular ecchymosis
what is diplopia diplopia is double
vision so there are two types of
diplopia monocular and binocular in case
of moon or killer diplopia diplopia is
seen when one eye is covered so what
happens in this case when both eyes are
open
the diplopia doesn't seem when one eye
is covered the diplopia is seen in case
of binocular diplopia in diplopia
disappears when one eye is covered so
with both the eyes the patient can see
normally but when when one eye is closed
diplopia seen in case of binocular
diplopia
what is this OCD it is an outer candle
distance normal is 100 mm in the
pupillary distance normally 60 mm and
inter candle distance normal is 30 mm
okay now we'll see the tele candles in
hyper Taylorism difference between Delhi
cancels in hyper terrorism in case of
tele candle there is an increase in
their candle distance so the inter
cancel distance is increased and there
will be smaller palpebral fissure length
in case of orbital hyperthyroidism there
will be increased inter candle distance
increases outer candle distance
increased interpupillary distance but
there will be normally palpebral fissure
length so dramatic Pelican is caused due
to ligaments paying and the how orbital
hyper Taylorism is due to the walls
playing a part that is the medium walls
of orbits playing a part causes
hyperthyroidism and the ligaments that
is medium can the ligaments on both
sides playing a part causes daily
canthus what are the indication for
surgical treatment of orbital fracture
when the end of thermos is greater than
3 mm when there is an herniation of
tissue into the antrum when there is an
tissue entrapment or limited mobility if
the developer is not resolving after two
weeks of observation in the orbital
fractures involving more than half of
the floor and when there is an increase
in the orbital volume so all these are
indication for surgical intervention of
the orbital fracture all these points
you need to remember approaches to
enthrall vital region various incisions
like infraorbital incision sub cellar
incision sub tarsal incision
transconjunctival or through
pre-existing laceration so in this
picture the see is showing intra orbital
incision
and the B is showing the subtitle
incision and a is subsidary incision and
her D is an extension of subsidiary
incision transconjunctival incision here
in this picture it is showing
transconductor an incision that is
placed in the palpable injectable for
aesthetic purpose so this can come as an
image-based question the subsidiary and
transconjunctival are commonly used
because of their superior aesthetic
vision so this is an important point
so which incision are most commonly used
for superior if the tigress L that is
subsidiary and transconjunctival what
are the materials that are used for
reconstruction of orbital floor the
autogenous materials like calvarium
iliac crest rib graft zygomatic buttress
and mandibular symphysis so they can ask
which autogenous material is used for
reconstruction of orbital floor so they
can be calvarium iliac crest rib grafts
zygomatic buttress mandibular symphysis
what are the alo plastic materials that
are used for the construction of floor
of the orbit like Teflon silicon methyl
methacrylate metal alloys titanium white
ilium and medpor so among autogenous alo
plastic material autogenous bone
grafting is the first line of choice
so these can be picture based question
this is in med poor showing porous
polyethylene implant which helps in the
reconstruction of the floor of the orbit
this is an preformed titanium mesh
available in the market which can be
used for reconstruction of floor of the
orbit so this is an custom-made titanium
mesh which can be customized according
to the patient's Anatomy 2 buttresses of
facial skeleton they are vertical
buttress transverse buttress and
sagittal buttress what does this
buttress represent buttress represents
the pillars of the face here the red
arrows are showing vertical buttresses
that is names of maxillary buttress
zygomatic of maxillary buttress and
there you go maxillary buttress and the
blue arrows are showing transverse
buttress that is horizontal buttress
that is so p-orbital them I can is in
fee orbital rim third is annular process
of the maxilla the fourth is a little
process of the mandible ends of this
lower border of the mandible in the
green arrows are showing the sagittal
buttress of the facial skeleton that is
the earlier process of the posterior
maxilla in the zygomatic arch what is
the importance of buttress they provide
adequate bone stock for reduction they
are the stable bone for Anchorage so
whatever we are doing that is during
management during plating the plates are
placed in this buttress region because
they have thick bone in case of mid frac
mid-face fracture the primary fracture
treatment is limited to two weeks after
two weeks the treatment is regarded as
delayed so these two points are very
important so primary treatment of the
mid-face fracture is limited to two
weeks that
it should be done before two weeks if
the fracture comes after two weeks the
treatment is considered as delayed what
are the goals in the management of
mid-face fracture to restore the anatomy
in all the three direction so you need
to remember these goals they can ask
your than MCQ the goals in the
management of mid-face fracture to
restore the anatomy in all the three
dimensions that is the horizontal
dimension vertical dimension and the
anterior posterior dimension and plating
of all the maxillary buttress if
possible restore the vertical dimension
and horizontal projection and
restoration of play morbid occlusion so
there are four goals that you need to
remember restoring the three dimensions
of a face and plating of all the
maxillary buttresses if possible and
restoration of the premorbid occlusion
so classification of leave for which was
modified by Marcion is very important
which was given in the year 1993 this
year also you need to remember so they
can ask you the type of fracture they
can ask you what is type 1 what is type
2 what is type 3 type 3a or 3b they can
ask you in an MC cube what is type 1 -
is low maxillary fracture when low
maxillary fracture is into multiple
segments it is 1 a type 2 is pyramidal
fracture - a is pyramidal fracture
placed nasal fracture type 2b is
primitive fracture and any fracture and
the type 3 is craniofacial disjunction
type 3 a is craniofacial disjunction
plus nasal fracture type 3 P is
craniofacial disjunction and knee so
orbital at model fracture and type 4 is
pyramidal fracture or cranial facial
disjunction with
the skull base fracture in for a
supraorbital rim is involved in 4b is
supraorbital grim place and deer cranial
fossa is involved in 4c disappear
orbital rim and here cranial fossa as
well as the orbital balls are involved
so all these types you need to by heart
the classically fault lines the first
line 3/4 line is low maxillary line and
the leave foot toe line is a pyramidal
shaped line and the leave for 3 line is
craniofacial disjunction extending from
FZ 2 FZ FZ is fronto psycho Matic suture
what is this identify it is impaired
little ecchymosis which is in classical
feature of leave for one fracture it is
also called as Guren sign what are the
characteristic feature of Lee for to
fracture moon phase or ballooning by
latent circum orbital atom or ecchymosis
that is black eye and dish face the
characteristic of Lee for 3 fracture
includes panda faces and raccoons eye in
Sycamore vital or periorbital acai
muscles by literally in hooding of the
eyes so all these characteristic
features only for 2 only for 3 fractures
you guys need to remember what is the
sensation this is a mid-face lead loving
incision it provides access to the nasal
dorsum at the model area nasal dorsum
ethmoidal area zygomatic body and lower
orbital rim as well this is an intraoral
incision intra
vestibular incision called as mid-face
degloving incision so any fracture in
this area can be approached intra orally
through this mid-face 11 incision what
is this sensation this is an maxillary
vestibular incision in case of mid-face
fracture when there is only for one
fracture and butlers need to be assessed
this incision is used that is maxillary
vegetable incision
what is the sensation this is a globular
incision this incision is given men you
need to see medial orbit needs a frontal
suture in nasal bridge so in case of
leaf or to fracture this incision can be
placed leaf or three fracture to suture
the needs of frontal area or the nasal
bridge this question can come as an
diagram based question identifies in
this picture the a shows lateral eyebrow
approach that is little eyebrow incision
for approaching the frontal a grammatic
suture and the B that is upper eyelid
approach also called as upper
blepharoplasty incision this incision
can also be used to assess the front o
cyclomatic suture as well as the
supraorbital trim management of LeFort
fracture through mini plates
plating it the buttress region in case
of this is a picture showing management
of the only afford one fracture and you
see the leave for one line low maxillary
fracture for hanging maxilla
two plates are place at the buttress
region in case of leave for two three
plates I place that one one is at the
nasal frontal suture and one is a
in draw by pilgrim and the other is at
the zygomatic alikes lady buttress in
case of leaf or three fracture three
plates are placed first plated the mezzo
frontal suture and one plated the absurd
suture and one bladed the zygomatic arch
what are these pictures showing these
pictures are showing suspension wiring
of the mandible this is most commonly
employed in cases of LeFort fracture to
sandwich the maxilla between the
mandible and the skull so there are
various types of suspension wirings like
frontal succumbs I go Matic zygomatic
aims of orbital
suspension wiring piriform aperture
suspension wiring so this is enzymatic
our suspension why sorry this is an
intra orbital rim suspension wiring this
is one side romantic art suspension
wiring because the wire is hanging from
the zygomatic arch this is a beautiful
upper chest expansion wiring this is a
frontal suspension wiring thank you guys
this is all for the orbit and the
mid-face fracture thank you all for your
love will be soon coming up with more
informative stuff till then keep working
hard keep motivating yourself because
trust me guys no one is going to do it
for you unless and until you do it for
yourself see you soon signing off dr.
love
