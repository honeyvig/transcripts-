hey everyone welcome to another tutorial
by simply learn
in this tutorial we will learn about
react type script let's see what's in it
for you in this session
we will first look at what is typescript
then we will understand what is react
then we will look at some of the
features of react
followed by which we will look at the
advantages of using react with
typescript
and proceeding further we will see how
to install and configure typescript and
react
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click down the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
what is typescript
typescript is object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of javascript
typescript was designed by anders
hegelsberg at microsoft
the limitations of javascript for the
developing large-scale applications at
microsoft and among its external
customers led to the creation of
typescript
because of the difficulty of working
with complicated javascript code there
was a demand for custom tooling to make
developing javascript components easier
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere where javascript is supported
in a browser on node.js or in any other
application
typescript is a javascript with some
additional features
to support more robust interaction with
the editor typescript adds additional
syntax to javascript
and typescript is moreover a scripting
language that understands javascript and
uses type inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
what is react
react is a javascript library for
creating user interfaces that is
declarative efficient and customizable
react allows to build complicated user
interfaces out of components which are
small independent pieces of code
react was first open sourced in 2013 by
facebook and has since become one of the
most popular libraries in the front-end
world with frameworks like redux react
can simply be extended to integrate
functionality like routing and state
management patterns
features of react
react is an open source library and is
developed by facebook
react apps are fast flexible modular and
scalable
react is powerful javascript libraries
that creates interactive interfaces
popular libraries of react are redux
material design and chest
redux helps manage state in javascript
redux is the most popular of all react
libraries because it easily tracks the
state as the application size grows
react has robust developer community and
variety of libraries
the act is declarative and component
based declarative views make the react
code more predictable and easier to
debug
and react is component based that is
react letters build encapsulated
components that manage their own state
and compose them to make complex uis
advantages of using typescript with
react
in a react project typescript allows us
to write html code directly
typescript delivers superior
intellisense and code completion for jsx
when used with react
javascript xm is abbreviated as jsx
when using ides like visual studio
visual studio code autumn webstorm
eclipse and others typescript comes in
handy this allows better development by
improving autocomplete and snippet
generation
typescript has code that is easy to read
and understand
typescript is statically typed language
the distinction between statically and
dynamically typed programming languages
is when type checking occurs
variables in static language are type
checked
while creating react app complex type
definitions can be defined as interfaces
in typescript this is useful when you
wish to use a complex type in the
application such as an object with
multiple properties
microsoft supports typescript
an open source programming language
millions of developers all over the
world enjoy and use it
this implies that if you get stuck while
learning or using typescript you can
easily obtain help and answers on the
community portal
we can integrate typescript into our
existing react projects for this we can
configure the typescript compiler
installing and configuring typescript
and react
before we install typescript we need to
install node.js
go to the node.js official website and
you can install node.js from there once
you install node.js go to the command
prompt and run this command npm install
hifunji typescript
this command is used to install
typescript globally
once you have installed typescript to
check if the typescript is installed
properly run the command tsc typescript
compiler
hyphen v to check the version of the
typescript compiler
next we need to install react
for installing react and creating a
react project
go to the command prompt and run this
command
npx create react app this command will
create a simple folder structure of the
application then install all the
necessary modules and get the project up
and running for you
first of all we need to install node.js
to install node.js go to the official
website of node
nodejs.org
go to the downloads in downloads here
you can
install the node.js if you have windows
if you have mac os
you can install it from here so i have
windows so i'll install windows since i
have already installed so i'll cancel it
so once you have installed node.js then
go to the command prompt
in command prompt we need to install the
typescript to install the typescript run
the command npm that is node package
manager
install
hyphen g
g stands for installing globally
and then typescript
what this command does is it installs
the typescript globally
run this command once you run this
command the typescript will be installed
since i have already installed
typescript i'll cancel it so after you
have installed typescript to check if
the typescript is installed properly run
the command typescript compiler tsc
space
hyphen hyphen b
and press enter
and this will show the version
and this will show the version of the
typescript installed so i have version
4.5.4 installed in my device
so after this to get started with the
project after successful installation of
node.js and typescript
let us create a new folder to create a
new folder type the command make
directory
and we'll name the folder as
typescript
hyphen
react
so enter
so we have created the new folder
next we'll change the directory to the
folder which we created so cd
to
ts react
so after this we need to initiate the
project
so to initiate the project we will run
the command npm
init
it is asking for package name
just click enter
and
click enter
then is this ok click s
after this what we need to do is create
react app
so to create react app run the command
npx
space create
react app
and enter
so this command will create a simple
folder structure for your application
and then install all the necessary
modules and get your project up and
running for you
so this is the project folder which i
have already created
i have the vs code folder wherein i have
settings.json files in this then i have
installed all the node modules
then i have the source folder
in source folder i have app.tsx file
counter.esx
index.html declarations
index.exe file
to install webpack just run the command
npm install web pack
space webpack hyphen cli in the terminal
this will install the web pack
so i'll show you a simple hello world or
hello everyone program
so in app.tsx
we'll just type hello everyone
and we'll give the color as green and
align the text at the center input since
we have imported the counter
file so in counter file
we'll just type in subscribe to simply
learn with text align in the center and
with the color red
so we'll just run this
and here we go
here we go we have the message hello
everyone and subscribe to simply
so with that we have reached the end of
