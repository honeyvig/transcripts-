sci-fi movies and books depict a future
with sentient machines capable of
interacting with humans and performing
tasks just like people would
what if we told you that this future is
already a reality all of this is already
made possible by machine learning
machine learning is the science of
programming machines to think and act
like humans without being specifically
programmed to we already use machine
learning in our daily life without
knowing it email spam recognition spell
check even the youtube video
recommendation which brought you here
are implemented using machine learning
machine learning uses algorithms to
learn tasks these algorithms are fed
with data from which they learn to
perform these tasks this means that over
time as changes in data occur we don't
need to reprogram our application just
let it find patterns and learn from the
new data
machine learning is a subset of
artificial intelligence which is a
science concerned with imparting
human-like intelligence onto machines
and creating machines which can sense
reason act and adapt
deep learning is a sub-branch of machine
learning which is inspired by the
working of the human brain
machine learning is leading us to a
future where machines can learn and
think and has opened us a whole new
plethora of job opportunities
