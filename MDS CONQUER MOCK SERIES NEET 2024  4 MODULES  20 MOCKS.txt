hi winners this is Dr shrihan from Team
MDS conquer uh now I'm here to discuss a
few important things related to the uh
mock test series that MDS conquer has
announced from November 14th
2023 okay so this is uh focusing mainly
on neat MDS 2024 and the 10 to date as
of now uh given for this exam
is February 9th
2024 okay so February 9 2024 was the
tenative date announced by uh nbe 3 days
back okay so now let's keep this date uh
as a date of exam as a dday and let's
start focusing full-time on Preparation
okay so there may be uh a little bit of
chances for the exam can be postponed
like a week or 10 days max maximum 10 or
uh a week or two weeks maximum okay
considering our requests and XY Z
factors but as of now I want you to keep
uh February 9th 2024 as a Target and
start working towards it so if you just
count the number of days that are left
over for the exam it is less than 3
months okay it's less than 90 uh 90 days
okay so roughly it is like uh uh like if
you consider on the on the starting of
the test series that is November 14th
you have somewhere around like 8 87 or
88 days for your February 9th 2024 so
whatever the extra days that are going
to add if the exam is postponed or
something you can consider them as a
relaxation revision days okay but please
do keep FIB 9th as a Target date of your
examination okay so what I made is like
in this 80 uh 87
days 87 days plan okay I simply splitted
uh uh your preparation days are 57 to 58
days uh for your modules I'll explain
what are the modules okay and the left
over 30 days for your
last
revision
with mock
exams so mock exams are basically going
to help you in time management
time management or negative marking
because negative marking plays a very
very vital role in the in these exams
right so it's going to help in managing
the time and it's going to help in uh
minimizing your score like maximizing
your score by minimizing your negative
marking okay so first of all I hope like
most of you have this basic idea about
uh your neat MDS neat
examination so this video is basically
for the students who are about to start
their preparation but most of them who's
already on bar okay they know the basic
idea so need MDS
examination is going to be for
240 questions okay and each question
each right answer okay each right answer
is going to carry plus 4 score and wrong
answer that is being attempted is going
to carry minus one and unattempted
un tempate is going to carry Z zero
score so this is this is the scoring of
neat examination okay so right
so neat examination neat
MDS is going to be the exam for the
counseling of
all
dental
colleges in the
country
except
aims PGA and J okay so except these
three colleges all the colleges means
all the government dental colleges both
central government as well as state
government and all the private colleges
that is the local colleges as well as
the teamed colleges except as PJ and jar
all the colleges admissions will be
filled through neat examination the
second one is it is an eligibility
criteria for your army Dental
cops okay so for Army Dental cops also
eligibility criteria they're going to
take his neat examination so this is a
main thing why most of us will give neat
examination okay so the next important
aspect is as already told it is going to
be
uh 240 mcqs uh this is an official
blueprint that is being released by um
nbe people on their website okay as of
now it is not updated so this is the
last year blueprint so in which your uh
the question paper is being split Ed
into uh part A and Part B okay part A is
basically the basic subjects and Part B
is going to be more of an incline to
clinical or dental subjects okay so if
you check out the uh in-depth in-depth
the subjects what they have mentioned
clearly according to the DCA regulations
of BDS syllabus okay so the first
subject is going to be in the part A is
going to be General Anatomy including
embryology General embryology and
general histology which is going to
carry 14 marks physiology plus
biochemistry 77 it's going to carry 14
marks Dental anatomy and dental
histology that includes Dental
embryology also it's going to carry 7
plus 714 General path and micro 7+ 74
General pharmacology and dental
pharmacology 7 + 714 general medicine is
15 and general surgery are 15 so these
are the highest scoring subjects general
medicine and general surgery so then
going to Part B Part B is for 140 marks
which is more inclined to the dental
subjects that is
your dental materials 14 oral pathology
and oral microbiology 14 oral medicine
oral Radiology 14 pedo and preventive 14
Oro 14 pero 14 proo crown and Bridge 14
conservative and Endo 14 oral surgery 14
and Public Health Community 14 so
totally it's going to be splitted into
part A and Part B part A is for 100 mcqs
Part B is for 140 mcqs total you're
going to have 240 mcqs each McQ is going
to carry plus four marks and one wrong
McQ is going to decrease your score by
minus one okay so this is a rough
blueprint and you have to attempt these
240 questions splited into part A and
Part B in 3 hours time that is nothing
but 180 minutes so time management is a
very very important task that you have
to make it so what I have done okay so
as already I have given your 87 or 88
days I'm being splitting into 57 58 days
plus 30 days of mock examinations and
revision plan final revision plan okay
so in which the module one module two
module three module four so I have
splitted your schedule into four models
basically okay so that is your 1 2 3
three 4 so in this four modules how I
have sced this your
58 days is so what I have done is I have
given uh module one I have given 15 days
module two I have given 15 days module
three I have given 12 days and module 4
I have given 16 days okay so totally it
is going to turn to 58 days plus 30 days
or 29 days of your mock exam revision
plan okay right so in which MO module
one okay for 15 days we are covering 63
marks and this is going to start from
November 14th to November 28th and last
day you going to take an exam on module
1 for 240 marks same as your neat final
exam okay so in which Endo I have
included seven marks pedo 14 pero 14
Dental Anatomy 7 and dental histology
with embryology 7 cons cons in
integrated with DM means whatever
conservative
Dentistry part which is there in Dental
materials we are going to do along with
it because most of the DM will be
integrated to conservative proo Oro okay
left over are three topics of DM which
I'll be discussing personally on the
group so we can do it DM integrated we
can do it and the main motto of keeping
Dental histology here is a part of
dental histology will be covered with
Endo okay and a part of dental histology
will be covered with uh pero that is
parodontium will be covered here pulp
will be covered here pulp and peral will
be covered here okay and uh anamel
Dentin will be covered here so most of
the DM will be integrated to
conservative endo and pero the leftover
DM will be doing it okay no need to
worry so this is how the first 15 days
plan will be going and it's going to
carry 63 marks out of your 240 neat
examination and it's going to run for 15
days jumping into module two the module
two is going to include General
pathology for seven marks Community plus
preventive again I told you right pedo
is already done in the module one so
Community is going to contain a part of
pedo Community is going to contain a
part of conservative also your pit and
fissure sealant okay your preventive
resin registra material some areas of
art some areas of mid fluorides and all
these are part of pedo as well as
operator so we are going to repeat them
again okay so that that's going to save
your time so General Anatomy 14 that
includes General
embryo and general histology and proo
integrated to DM the part of proo that
is being integrated to DM will be
covered here then comes the biochemistry
for seven marks so we are going to cover
okay 15 days module which is going to
start from November 29th to December
13th and it's going to cover 63 marks
again okay so now on the last day on
December 13th you are going to take two
exams okay one
exam is on on module
2 and the second
exam is going to be module 1 plus module
2 that you can consider
as mock 1 or grand exam 1 okay right I
hope this is very very clear okay then
jumping into module 3 the module 3 runs
for only 12 days okay so this is more of
an clinical oriented content so in this
module 3 what we are going to cover is
it is going to be 12 days it's going to
cover 50 marks and it's going to start
from December 13th to December 25th and
it's going to cover Ortho 14 marks oral
surgery 14 marks general surgery oral
surgery general surgery is more of an
integrated so you can do together and
oral Radiology for seven marks so this
is going to carry a a a 50 marks okay
then jumping into module four before
module four so now you are going to have
December 25th you're going to have two
exams one exam on module 3
the second exam is on module 1 plus
module 2 plus module
3 I hope it's very very clear so jumping
into module 4 which is going to start
from December 26th to January 10th okay
it's going to be 64 marks and it's going
to cover 16 days schedule in which it's
going to cover microbiology General and
oral 7 + 7 physiology 7 pharmacology
General and oral 7 + 7 general medicine
of 15 oral medicine of seven oral
pathology of seven okay right so the
main Moto is most of these subjects
which are included in the module 4 are
very very important for exam one second
thing almost all these subjects are
integrated to each other okay most of
the content is very common for these
subjects which I have listed in the
module 4 so module 4 you'll be having an
exam on 10th January two exams one exam
on module 4 exclusively and the second
exam is on module one plus module 2 plus
module 3 plus module four okay right so
I hope you got a clear-cut idea that how
we have planned the modules so once we
are done with that uh then from uh
January uh 10th after January 10th uh we
we'll be having uh one or two
examinations exclusively on the uh
repeated Concepts or repeated questions
uh in the last 10 here I'll be giving
those lists and everything so we'll be
having like uh uh roughly 20 mock
examinations okay 20 mock examinations
out of which three uh three three or
four will be done here so modu is going
to be four followed by 20 mock
examinations three of these mock exams
one mock exam you're going to do along
with module two the second mock exam
you're going to do with module 3 the
third mock exam you're going to do with
module four okay right so followed by
you will be having
two uh repeated Concepts and repeated
mcqs exams okay sotally five five mock
exams will be done here followed by
you'll be having the left over 15 mock
exams okay in the last one month okay so
the main mot of conducting mock
examinations is one is time management
okay time management you can attend by
giving 10 Mark exams that's that's more
than sufficient but the main mot of
conducting uh 20 plus uh these four okay
24 four modules plus 20 Mark exams is uh
we are trying to cover the end entire
syllabus all the important areas in a
particular topic all important topics in
a particular subject will be covered in
this
24 uh mock plus model exams that's the
primary motto of this uh of this mock
test series okay right so I I hope you
got a clear-cut idea so just going to
recap the things again so so this is how
I have plann so 58 days for modules and
followed by 30 days for last revision
and mock exam ations okay so part A and
Part B so part A is more of a basic
subjects and Part B is more of a
clinical subjects which I have splitted
clearly right answer is going to carry
plus4 and wrong answer is going to carry
minus one so first one uh the module one
okay so module one you're going to have
an exam on
28th so next goes to module two module
two you're going to have an exam on
December 13th one exam on module 2
exclusive one exam on module 1 plus
module 2 next one is 28th uh 25th
December module 3 exam plus module 1 2 3
exam 10 January module one exam and
module 1 2 3 4 exam followed by you're
going to have two exams exclusively on
the repeated topics and repeated
Concepts I'm going to give the list and
I'll try to discuss as many things as
possible uh within the time limitation
okay so this is how we have planned okay
uh so this video is just exclusively
explaining the uh timetable and and uh
the patterns okay
