hey everyone and welcome to this new
video of simply learn on proof of work
in blockchain
in this video we are going to cover all
important concepts and components
related to proof of work
first we will have a quick introduction
of blockchain then we will understand
what is proof of work
then we will look into how does it works
and after that we will explore why is it
actually needed
what are the issues faced by proof of
work
and at last we will look into the
blockchains working with proof of work
so without further delay let's get
started with the video
but before that let's have a quick
introduction to blockchain
the term blockchain refers to a
decentralized database that is made up
of sequential blocks that contain
recorded data
the database is backed up by a network
of self-contained participants known as
nodes
now let's understand what is proof of
work
proof of work is a decentralized
consensus method that requires network
participants to spend time solving an
arbitrary mathematical puzzle in order
to prevent the system from being hacked
it is widely used in cryptocurrency
mining for validating transactions and
mining new tokens
it helps in the processing of
peer-to-peer transactions securely
without the need of a trusted third
party
it also requires huge amount of energy
at scale which only increases as more
miners join the network
now let's have a look at how proof of
work works
the right to add new blocks to a proof
of work blockchain is provided to
individuals who are willing to expand
computational resources to solve
cryptographic issues
the participants competing to add new
blocks are referred to as miners and the
process is referred to as mining
miners are the one who execute proof of
work miners
use their computational power to locate
a valid block when a piece of
information such as a transaction needs
to be added to the blockchain
this is accomplished by locating a hash
that meets the network protocol specific
requirements
in cryptography a hash is the outcome of
a hash function it converts any format
or size of data into fixed size numbers
the protocol established a level of
mining difficulty that is
algorithmically adjusted so that the
time it takes to obtain a proper hash
averages 10 minutes
miners can sometimes locate multiple
blocks that satisfy the protocol's
requirements at the same time
and split the chain n into
because there can be only one accurate
chain the protocol must account for
these circumstances
miners will initially continue to mine
on both chains
but once another block is discovered on
top of one of the two prior blocks that
chain becomes the canonical chain and
miners are economically incentivized
to discard the other block
one of the advantages of proof of work
blockchain in terms of security is their
resilience to civil attacks the civil
attacks occurs when one player in the
network generates many false identities
in the order to get an unfair edge
over other network participants who only
have one identity 51 attacks occur when
a single user takes control of more than
51 percent of the network's resources
and hence has control over the adding of
new blocks
now we know how proof of work works
let's dive down deeper and explore why
do we need proof of work
majorly proof of work is required for
security and fraud prevention as well as
trust
proof of work is intended to prevent
users from printing coins they didn't
earn
or from double spending
if users could spend their coins more
than once the currency would effectively
become worthless
proof of work ensures that independent
data processors or miners can't lie
about a transaction
linking a block with the proof of work
hash of its predecessor results in
tamper resistance
because the hash of each block is an
ingredient in the hash of the following
block
any changes in the chain will affect the
final proof of work
hash as well as all block hashes in
between
so the deeper the altered block the more
computational effort needed for
tampering
the first miner who discovers the proof
of work answers publishes the solution
to the rest of the network when a new
block is discovered all nodes are
notified we check the answer twice
before moving on to the next block
ps if correct the block miners earn the
transaction fees and the block reward
the protocol only accepts the longest
chain as valid and authentic a fake
chain is impractical in the long run
since a minus chances of receiving the
block reward and minimal
other miners will continue to extend the
valid chain quicker than the tampered
chain over time
moving on let's have a look at the other
side of the coin as well as understand
some of the major issues with proof of
work
first is it has a negative impact on the
environment
second the 51 attack can be used against
it if miners gain control of 51 of the
hashing power they will be able to
determine what is true
aside from the enormous cost of price
there is no mechanism in place to punish
any malicious miners
and four because every node must process
every transaction it does not scale
properly while sharding the network may
boost efficiency it also reduces
security this was all about proof of
work let's explore the best blockchain
networks working with proof of work
bitcoin is the largest and the very
first blockchain to adopt proof of work
and work with it ethereum is next
working with proof of work
though it is aiming to switch to proof
of stake which we will talk about in a
coming video
then comes bitcoin cash which is an
extension of bitcoin and follows the
same structure thus it also works on
proof of work
then come litecoin which is also an
altcoin of bitcoin
and then comes monero another
cryptocurrency serving similar purpose
as other cryptos
well this is all about proof of work in
blockchain we have almost reached the
end of this video if i missed anything
