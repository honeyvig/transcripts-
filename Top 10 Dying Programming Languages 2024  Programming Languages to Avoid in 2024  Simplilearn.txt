in today's rapidly changing digital
world it's essential for developers to
keep up with the latest Technologies and
programming languages with new languages
being introduced constantly it's natural
for some languages to become less
popular and eventually die out in this
video we will explore the top 10 dime
programming languages their Origins and
the reasons why they are falling out of
favor we will also discuss the impact of
their Decline and what this means for
the future future of programming on
number 10 we have Visual Basic 6 Visual
Basic 6 is a fourth generation
programming language that was developed
by Microsoft in 1990s it's known for its
integrated development environment or
IDE and its graphical user interface
that is GUI for building Windows desktop
applications Visual Basic six popularity
has declined due to the raise of more
modern and flexible development
Frameworks such as net and the
increasing usage of web- based
applications on number nine we have
assembly assembly language or machine
code is a low-level programming language
that is specific to a particular
processor architecture it's known for
its ability to generate extremely
efficient code and is often used for
developing operating systems and device
drivers assembly language popularity has
declined significantly due to its
complexity and the rise of other more
userfriendly programming languages such
as C and C++ that offer higher level
abstractions while still providing the
necessary performance and efficiency for
many applications on number eight we
have photron photron is a general
purpose programming language that was
developed in 1950s for scientific and
numerical Computing it's known for its
ability to handle large- scale
scientific competitions and is still
used by many researchers in this field
however Photon syntax is complex and
difficult to learn and its usage has
declined significantly due to the rise
of other programming languages such as
Python and R which offer similar
functionality but with more intuitive
syntax on number seven we have classic
ASP classic ASP is a general purpose
scripting language developed by
Microsoft in 1990s it is known for its
server side scripting capabilities and
is often used for web development
however its popularity has declined
significantly due to the rise of other
web development Technologies such as PHP
GSP and Ruby on Rails which offers more
modern and flexible development
Frameworks on number six we have
objective
C++ objective C++ is a combination of
objective c and C++ programming
languages it allows developers to use
the syntax features and libraries of
both languag in a single code base
objective C++ has FedEd Into Obscurity
in recent years due to the rise of other
and more popular languages such as Swift
swift which was developed by Apple as a
successor of objective c is gaining
popularity among iOS and map developers
due to its modern syntax easy learning
curve and strong Community Support on
number five we have haskill haskill is a
functional programming language that was
developed by by a group of
mathematicians and computer scientists
in 1980s haskill is known for its pure
functional programming Paradigm which
means that all competitions are done
without side effects it's often used for
scientific Computing and data analysis
due to its strong type system but its
complexity and functional programming
Paradigm have made it less appealing to
developers than other languages such as
Python and r on number four we have
small talk small talk is an
objectoriented dynamic programming
language developed by alen K in 1970s
small talk is known for its emphasis on
objectoriented programming and its
support for the model view controller
architecture it's often used for
developing educational and game software
because of its powerful oop features and
ease of use however there are other oop
languages that have gained popularity in
recent years such as Java and Python and
small talks popularity has ran as a
result on number three we have Pearl
Pearl is a general purpose interpreted
programming language that was developed
in 1987 by Larry wall the name Pearl is
a combination of pattern matching and
practical extraction and Reporting
language Pearl is known for its powerful
text manipulation and pattern matching
capabilities which made it a popular
choice for web developers in early
2000s however with the rise of language
such as python which offer similar
functionality in more concise and
readable syntax PSE popularity has been
in Decline for several years on number
two we have Objective C Objective C is a
programming language developed by Apple
in 1980s and is used for developing
applications for iOS and Mac while it
has its own Unix and text the language
can also be used used to write objective
C++ code which is combination of
objective c and C++ although Objective C
has its Niche following its popularity
has declined in recent years due to rise
of other languages such as Swift which
is designed specifically for developing
apps for Apple's platform and on number
one we have cobal cobal or common
business objectoriented language was
developed in 1950s and is considered one
of the earliest programming languages it
was designed to be easy to read and easy
to use for business applications which
is why it became popular in the banking
industry and other business sectors
however Cobalt syntax can be cryptic and
hard to read for those not familiar with
the language and it doesn't support
modern programming models such as
objectoriented programming with the rise
of new languages such as Java and python
that offer a more intuitive and flexible
s Tex Cobalt's popularity has declined
significantly in the recent years in
conclusion the top 10 dying programming
languages are Cobalt Objective C Pearl
Small Talk haskill objective C++ classic
ASP fortron assembly and Visual Basic
six these languages were popular in
their own time but have fallen out of
favor due to new technologies competing
languages and changing development needs
with new programming languages being
developed every year it's important for
developers to stay up toate on the
latest trends and Technology stack
however as the old saying goes some
things never change and Cobalt may never
truly die staying ahead in your career
