hi everyone this is dr. Mara 3 from Team
MDS Konica I think I would have
everything is going good
so now we'll see the temperature
regulation in this video this is the
contents of this temperature regulation
which includes from the introduction to
the references so as all of us know that
temperature is very important aspect in
in the form of home use to maintain the
homeostasis and we always humans and
everyone will have a adaptation for
varying climatic conditions so there are
this the classification of temperature
paid may animals I mean based on the
temperature animals may be of homeo
thermacore apical atomic animals so if
you see here there are hetero terms
homier terms end or terms and ectotherms
ectotherms which rely on heat from the
environment whereas home you thumbs keep
body temperature constant
Hitler thumbs will allow body
temperature to fluctuate and endotherms
will produce their own heat so these are
the examples given for each type of
classification so this body temperature
can be measured by in many ways it from
the different parts like mouth axilla
rectum over the skin and ego so this
thing flow chart you have to write in
the examination that mean whether that
can be measured temperature can be
measured and this box is very important
it will show that temperature I mean the
normal body temperature oral rectal
axillary ear and core temperature and
this is the age and this is range of
temperature so this table is important
for you then coming to the instrument
which are used in this body temperature
oral thermometer tympanic forehead basal
and pacified thermometer so these are
all other types of thermometers which
are used for measuring the body
temperature
coming to the variations of the body
temperature anything any physiological
activity or anything you know body will
have two types of variations whether in
a normal variations that is seen in
physiological state and the pathological
variation that can be seen in the
disease state so for this temperature
also there are few conditions where you
have physiological changes like age sex
I mean in the previous table you have
seen a different age you'll have the
different temperature and sex also and
for the male and female you'll have the
temperate temperature and based upon the
variation I mean even after the meal
there will be increase in the
temperature so this is the physiological
variations we have to mention in the
exam and the a few other physiological
variations like during exercise sleep
emotion and menstrual cycle also there
will be physiological variations in the
temperature which I will be normal for
all the individuals so that
physiological part has been done so this
pathological part is very important
which may be because of hypothermia or
hypothermia that means increased the
body temperature a decreased body
temperature and as Heath I mean like
there will be of increased or a
decreased body temperature in the
pathological state heat should be
balanced in our body so this is maybe
because of heat gain in their body or
heat loss in the ball from the body
these two should be maintained so heat
gain or products in the body may be
because of metabolic activities or any
muscular activity or any hormonal
activity radiation from the heat she
wearing and drawn fat tissue will see
these things in the next slides so you
can see here I can I think this is very
easy to draw also so here you can see
evaporation from the body convection
from the body and this is mainly because
of the muscle contraction and conduction
from the ground and the radiation and
because of this radiation coming from
the Sun so these are the different types
of methods which help in heat loss and
heat gain from the body and this is a
geological thing where this our
temperature is maintained by here the
hypothalamus where it regulates the
pituitary gland then coming to the
thyroid gland which produce the
thyroxine increased metabolic rate so
that because of this hypothalamic
temperature you will see in adrenal
glands that is increased metabolic rate
sweat glands you will see the
perspiration or the sweat formation and
again it acts on the skin arterioles
which leads to constriction or dilation
of the blood and these also act on
skeletal muscles and you'll produce this
will produce the movement of shivering
hence this is the physiological method
where the skin temperature is maintained
and this flowchart is important and easy
you can draw in the examination also so
you can see here this shivering
generates the heat from the skeletal
muscle as it contracts involuntarily
then coming to the fat and lean persons
in fat and lean persons how it will be
so large fat droplet will be there
whereas many fat droplets will be there
so here this gene activators of brown
fat we have seen that brown fat helps in
the radiation of temperature so these
are the gene activators of brown fat it
includes PDCA one
heme oxygenase one and fibroblast growth
factor and also the other things like
cold iron that means the insulin stress
entire hormone also helped I mean
modulate the temperature then coming to
the heat loss from the body we have seen
all the mechanisms were heat gain now
these are the heat loss from the body
that is conduction radiation convection
evaporation and panting so this is
representing the this will represent the
convection here conduction from the
ground and evaporation from the body and
radiation from the other sources
conduction means energy is transformed
by the direct contact
convection means energy is transformed
by the mass molecule of
the molecules have operation I mean it
will part spray it from the skin on the
sweat glands I'm coming to the
regulation of the body temperature as we
have seen long back the flowchart right
so this hypothalamus will be of a heat
gain center and the heat loss center
which can react in the two ways so these
are the nuclei of hypothalamus where you
can see the prior ventricular nuclear
water balance with the stress and this
posterior hypothalamic area will help in
the shivering and then here this
supraoptic nucleus in the water balance
and this anterior hypothalamic area is
very important because it helps in the
body temperature regulation so you can
write this you can mention this nucleus
of nuclei and anterior hypothalamic area
which helps in the mention of body
temperature and if you go to this
hypothalamus the brain temperature it
will cause the central and thermo
receptors which are acts as a thermo
regulatory center and in periphery
you'll have the skin temperature
maintained by peripheral thermo
receptors and and this again this
central thermo receptors will affect the
organs like skin arterioles skeletal
muscle and sweat glands which leads to
the core body temperature remember guys
the the thing is you can impress the
examiners with your answers by this flow
charts or men are few diagrams only
don't write in their large paragraph
paragraphs and everything mention with
this wall and sweet points are within
the flow chart or at the diagrams so
here you can see this hypothalamic
temperature sensitive center but this
posterior thigh rama's and anterior
hypothalamus it acts as a heat loss in
here act as a he's promoting center and
because of heat promoting center good
aeneas vasoconstriction he will be there
get a nice vasodilation increased
metabolism will be same no original
stimulation you'll see shivering here
and we're sweating here then coming to
the heat loss center this is because of
the preoptic nucleus of anterior
hypothalamus
he'd gain center is posterior
hypothalamic you can mention these
nuclei and the centers in your
examination if temperature regulation is
given and mechanism of temperature
regulation can be seen when their body
temperature increases or when body
temperature decreases so when body
temperature increases this blood
temperature increases stimulates the
thermo receptors which will again bring
two back to the normal when body
temperature increases you can see here
that warmth receptors from the skin will
go and act on the preoptic and anterior
hypothalamic nuclei which act in the
posterior hypothalamus then inhibition
of the sympathetic nervous system which
finally leads to vasodilation sweating
and again this will leads to the normal
body temperature and then again in the
cyclic race the increased body
temperature then wha by the warmth
receptors from the skin and deep Whizzer
are stimulated so this is a mechanism
where you can see when body temperature
what happens when a body temperature
increases so promotion of heat loss can
be by increasing the secret offset and
by inhibiting the sympathetic centers in
the posterior hypothalamus and promotion
of this thing can be cutaneous
vasodilation which leads to increased
blood flow excessive sweating heat loss
increased through sweating and decreased
body temperature so we have seen what
happens when our body temperature is
increased now we'll see what happens
when body temperature decreases then it
will be like prevention of the heat loss
and then promotion of the heat
protection can be seen and prevention of
the heat loss is through sympatric
Center which cause vasoconstriction and
which will decrease the blood flow to
the skin whereas if you see promotion of
the heat production if body temperature
is low heat gain Center stimulates
primary motor then enormous heat can be
produced and you can see here this
sympathetic Center activates heat gain
centers that is Audrina
see Christian can be seen or a tire shop
in Hoorn one can be see Christian can be
seen which accelerate the cellular
activity and increase the release of TSH
then there will be release of thyroxine
and there will be accelerated the
metabolic activity and which increases
the temperature so this explains the
normal body temperature you can see here
this will decrease the body temperature
and this increase the body temperature
stimulation of the heat gains inter
simulation of the heat so if there is an
increase in biotic activity or shivering
here there will be of no shivering and
inhibits the sympathetic activity this
entire flow chart describes the previous
events which have which we have which we
have described or learnt so coming to
the applied aspects so if you can take
the screenshot of this thing is very
important then coming to the applied
aspects to applied aspects we can learn
that is hypothermia and hypothermia
hypothermia is nothing but the fever
right Sophie where there will be of
three types low-grade fever or a
moderate grade fever and a high-grade
fever and you can see the temperature
ranges here you get in this thing you
can see the temperature ranges that is
low-grade fever 39 degree Celsius
severus moderating fever 39 to 40 degree
high grade fever is there 40 degree
Celsius to 42 degree Celsius then coming
to the pathogens is soft favored may be
because of this hypothalamic setpoint is
increased then patients feel cold then
increase thermogenesis can be seen and
there will give rise in body temperature
so this flowcharts describe or this film
is crap how the I mean like how high per
the me irregular regulation of the
mechanism then coming to the science and
symptoms as we know their head back will
be there sweating shivering all these
are the signs and symptoms of
hypothermia or fever so approach to the
patient we have to take the history of
the patient physical examination
laboratory investigations because there
are several reasons for the fever so we
can approach the patient like this
then treatment will be of use of
antipyretics and we have to reduce the
oxygen demand and use of cooling blanket
is the main basic treatments then one
more high one important hypothermia
scene that is malignant hyperthermia and
this is mainly because of few anesthetic
agents also you can see tachycardia and
tachypnea in this small in hypothermia
so this may be because of mutation in
this ryr1 gene you can see here and you
can mention this gene in the exam and
this mean this can be treated by this
recognition of the condition immediate
management I mean like hyperventilate
the patient 100 percent offseason then
the important drug here will be of
dantrolene sodium so which is given you
can mention in the exam then that is
soft regarding hyperthermia then coming
to the hypothermia hypothermia is of
Bellona 35 degree Celsius so these all
of the causes of hyperthermia again the
classification of hypothermia based on
the temperature will be like this mild
hypothermia moderate and severe
hypothermia and so these are the this
box will give the symptoms of mild
moderate and severe hypothermia you can
write this intense and treat the
hypothermia like this first you have to
medical attention as soon as possible
then warm room or a shelter then remove
any wet clothing is there warm them and
place areas affected of frostbite in to
warm to touch water then actually this
temperature regulation is very important
because the nsights which UV use are
usually helped in the decrease the body
temperature so you can mention the drugs
which are use differently the regulation
of body temperature so these are the
drugs and here you can mention their
mechanism of action of all these any
sales like nside blocks the Cox
inhibitors which will block the
prostaglandin tanks
it will help in erection of all real
numbers so examiner's expect you to
mention these mechanism of action of
prostaglandins also because we are using
this and I say it's in our daily
clinical practice so you have you can
you have to come this really mention
these drugs also is in the applied
aspects so at that end you have to
mention all the references basic
references in the it's worth taken from
the physiology textbook or a pathology
text of a kind of pharmacology textbook
as we will write the drug names okay
