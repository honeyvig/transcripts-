hi everyone today we'll be learning
about the development of tooth
before we go into the core topic let's
see where the whole story started
it starts with a primitive oral cavity
also known as timonium
which is language stratified squamous
epithelium called as oral ectoderm or
primitive oral epithelium
the oral ectoderm contacts the endoderm
of the foregut
to form a membrane which is called as
buccopharyngeal membrane
so what is the buccopharyngeal membrane
it is the oral ectoderm
with the endoderm of food gut it's a
membrane formed by the oral ectoderm
contacting the in contacting the
endoderm of the foregut
now at about 27th day of gestation this
membrane will rupture
and the primitive oral cavity will
establish a connection with the fogut
now most of the connective tissue cells
underlying the oral ectoderm
are of neural crest or ecto mesenchyme
in origin
these cells are thought to instruct or
induce the overlying ectoderm to start
due to
development which actually begins in the
anterior portion
of what will be the future mancilla and
mandible
and proceeds posteriorly now so far i
have been using the terms ectoderm
endoderm mesoderm what are they these
are the pre
three primary germ layers and the
neural crust cells or the ectomycin kind
which is considered as a fourth primary
germ layer
also arises from the ectoderm or
mesoderm
coming to the dental lamina now as i
said at the 27th day of gestation the
bucco pharyngeal membrane will rupture
two or three weeks after the rupture of
the buccopharyngeal membrane
when the embryo is in about six weeks
old certain areas of the basal cells of
the oral ectoderm will start
proliferating
rapidly this leads to the formation of a
primary epithelial band which is a band
of the epithelium
that has invaded the underlying
ectomyson kind along each of the
horseshoe shaped future dental arches
that is your maxilla
and mandible as you can see in this
picture
these are the horseshoe shaped arches
which are formed by the
which is lined by the primary epithelial
band at about seventh week the primary
epithelial band will divide into an
inner process
that is a lingual process uh called as
dental lamina and the outer process that
is a buccal process called as vestibular
lamina
now the dental lamina serves the
premodium for the ectodermal portion of
the decedent's teeth
so where do we get our digital streets
from we get it from the
then the dental amino
and the later during development of the
jaws the permanent molars will arise
directly from the distal extinction of
this dental amino
so we get our deciduous teeth from the
dental lamina
whereas the vestibular mucosa is formed
by the vestibular lamina
now we as we get the serious teeth on
the dental a minor the distilled
extinctions of the dental lamina will
give rise to our permanent
mullahs now the development of first
permanent molar is initiated
the fourth month in utero whereas the
second molar is initially about
first year after birth and the third
molar are the fourth or fifth years
after birth
the distal proliferation of the dental
lamina is responsible for the location
of the germs of the permanent molars as
i said before
in the darkness of the mandible in case
of mandible and tuberosity of maxilla in
case of manzilla
the success of the successors of the
deciduous teeth that is a permanent
anteriors
and premolars develop from a lingual
extinction of a free end of the dental
lamina
which is present opposite to the enamel
organ of each disease too
the lingual extinction of the dental
lamina is named the successional lamina
and develops from the fifth month utero
to the tenth month of age now as you can
see
in this picture it these are the it
depicts the stages of the
development it starts with the oral
epithelium and enamel organ at butt
stage
and continues from birth stage to cap
stage and then goes to bell stage
advanced build stage and start emerging
in the oral cavity and these are the
later stages of emerge after the
emergence now
it includes growth calcification
eruption and attrition
in its fate of life there
the bug stage includes the initiation of
the growth cap stage includes the
proliferation
of the cells and belt stage includes
morpho differentiation
and histo differentiation morpho
differentiation is nothing but your mod
following the morphology
uh this is size shape and size and shape
resistor differentiation
is the histology that will be knowing
about the cells of the epithelium and
the connective tissue
moving on to the fate of the dental
lamina it is evident that the total
activity of the dental lamina
extends over a period of at least five
years
any particular portion of the dental
lamina functions for a much briefer
period
since only a relatively short time
elapses after the initiation of the
tooth development
before the dental lamina begins to
degenerate at that particular location
but dental amino may still be active in
the third molar region
after it has disappeared elsewhere
except for the occasional epithelial
remnants
as the teeth continues to develop they
lose their connection with the dental
amino
they later break up by a mesenchymal
invasion which is at the first
incomplete and does not perforate the
total thickness of the lamina
the we see we also see the remnants of
the dental amino and the remnants of the
dental amino
which persist at epithelial pearls or
islands within the jaws
are called as the cell rests of cells
they may be seen in jaws
as well as in gingiva as epithelial burs
pearls or islands
now the vestibular lamina so what is the
vestibular lamina
vestibular lamina is the buccal
process of the primary epithelial band
as they stand in the stating
the primary epithelial band is divided
into a buccal process
and a lingual process a outer process
and an inner process
the buccal or the outer process is
called as the vestibular minor
and the inner or the lingual process is
called as your dental amino
now i'm coming to this vestibular lamina
which is the buccal process of the
primary epithelial band the buccal
and the labial to the dental amino and
each general arch another epithelial
thickening develops
independently and also later in later
stages
it is the vestibular lamina also termed
as the lip furrow band
it subsequently hollows and forms the
oral vestibule
between the alveolar portion of the jaws
and the lips and the cheeks
so the place the hollow place which we
see between your cheeks and the lips and
your alveolar arch
is your vestibular lamina is what is a
vegetable lamina which is what forms a
future
oral vestibule
now let's brief out what we have learned
enough the development of dental lamina
so as i said a bucco pharyngeal membrane
is formed so what is the buccal
pharyngeal membrane here
it is a connection formed by the
ectoderm of the oral epithelium and the
endoderm of the
foregut now once this buccopharyngeal
membrane ruptures the 27th day of
gustation period
it will establish a connection between
the oral cavity and the foregut
now we see proliferation of this oral
ectoderm at the sixth week forming a
primary epithelial band which is divided
into two processes
outer process and an inner process the
outer process is your vestibular
lamina or the lip furrow band which
forms the oral vestibule and your in
your process is a dental
minor which forms the deciduous teeth
it has a distal proliferation which
contains the germs of the permanent
molasses
it has a lingual extension there is a
succession lamina which has the germs
of all the other permanent teeth and it
degenerates later
to form and remnants might be left out
which are called the remnants
which are which are the remnants of
cellulose of ceres
which appear as epithelial pearls or
islands
in the gingiva or jaws
now coming to the core topic tooth
development at certain points along the
dental lamina
each representing the location of one of
the 10 mandibular and maxillary
deciduous teeth
the ectodermal cells multiply still more
rapidly and form
little knobs that grow into the
underlying mesenchyme
each of these little down growths from
the dental amino represents the
beginning of the enamel organ
of the tooth part of a deciduous tooth
not all of these enamel organs
starts to develop the same time and the
first to appear
are those of the anterior mandible
region
so the first up here are the anterior
mandible object as we all know the first
t
adapter also your and mandible are
in sizes central in sizes now as a cell
proliferation continues each enamel
organ increase in size
sinks deeper into the ectomyson time and
your differential growth changes its
shape
as it develops it takes on a shape that
resembles a cap
with the outer convex surface facing the
oral cavity
and an inner concavity on the inside of
the cap that is
inside of the depression of the enamel
organ you see ectomyson chemical cells
increase in number now the tissue
appears
more dense than the surrounding
mesenchyme and represents the beginning
of the dental
papilla so what is the dental papilla
dental papilla is nothing but the
uh ectomyson chemical cells which are
seen on the
depression there is an inner side of
your enamel organ
surrounding the combined enamel organ
and the dental lamina we see the third
part of the toothed bird
that is your dental sac or dental
follicle so here we have come across
three names your then enamel organ
enamel organ will have an imagination on
the inner side
where you see the ectomyson camera cells
proliferating and proliferating from
your dental papilla
the enamel organ and the gentle papilla
together are covered by
another another structure called as your
dental sac or your tendril
follicle and conserve ectomyson camel
cells it also consists of ectomycin
common cells
and fibers that surrounds the dental
papilla and the normal organ
now thus the tooth germ consists of the
ectodermal component that is your enamel
organ
and ecto mesenchymal component that is
dental papilla and dental follicle
so enamel organ is of ectodermal and
origin to confuse yourself
it is ecto-dominant origin whereas your
dental papillae
follicle is ectomycin kaminogen
now the tooth and its supporting
structures are formed from this two germ
that is
these are the tooth and the supporting
structures are formed from these three
structures of the tooth
germ the enamel is formed from the
enamel organ
the dentinal pulp is formed from the
dental papilla
and the supporting tissues that is your
cementum periodontal ligament and
bone are formed from the dental follicle
now remember
this this way enamel organ as it has
enamel in its name so enamel develops
from the enamel organ
dental papilla dental papilla d
and p so it has d and p in its name
dentine
and pulp which also have dnp in their
names developed from the dental papilla
committed dental follicle what are the
what are left in tooth and tooth
supporting structures
your cementum alveolar bone and pdl is
the only remaining thing so they develop
from the
dental follicle
coming to the developmental stages
although truth development is a
continuous process
the developmental history of a tooth is
divided into several morphologic stages
for better descriptive purposes
while the size and shape of the
individual teeth are different they pass
to similar studies of development
they are named after the shape of the
enamel organ like whatever
shape the enamel organ takes it
represents the name of the stage
like that is the butt stage cap stage
and belt stage
the epithelium of the dental lamina is
separated from the underlying ectomyson
kind by a base membrane
simultaneous with the differentiation of
each general lamina
round or ovoid swellings arise from the
base membrane at ten different points
which is nothing but your
ten deciduous teeth future deciduous
teeth now
these are the primordia of the enamel
organs the toothbrush
thus the development of two germs is
initiated and the cells continue to
proliferate faster and faster
than the addison cells the dental lamina
is shallow
and microscopic sections often show two
buds close to the oral epithelium
since the main function of certain
epithelial cells of the tooth bud is to
form the enamel these cells constitute
the enamel organ
which is critical to the normal tooth
development in butt stage the normal
organ conserve peripherally located
low columnar cells and centrally located
polygonal cells
remember you see only two type of cells
in butt stage
one is your periphery located low
columnar cells
and sentry located polygonal cells many
of the cells of the tooth bud and the
surrounding mesenchyme undergo mitosis
as a result an increased mitotic
activity and the migration of the neural
crest cells into the area
the ecto mesenchymal cells surrounding
the tooth bud condense
the area of ectomyson chemical
condensation immediately subject to the
oral organ is a dental papilla
as i said you once the oral organ will
start invaginating
the accommodating ectomyson camera cells
that place is your dental papilla which
forms a future dentine and pulp
the condensed ectomechan kind that
surrounds the tube bud and the dental
papilla is a tender sac that is your
dental follicle
which forms the future supporting
structures both the dental papillae and
the dental sacs become
more well defined as the enamel organ
grows into cap and bell shapes
cap stage as the tooth but continues to
proliferate it does not
extend uniformly into a larger sphere as
i said
it does not grow uniformly instead you
see an unequal growth in different parts
of the tooth bud which leads to your cap
stage
that is what gives the an animal organ a
capsule which is characterized by a
shallow invasion on the deep surface of
the tooth bud
so what i say again this invasion is
nothing but your ecto mesenchymal cells
proliferating and proliferating to form
your dendritic papilla
in this stage you will see the outer and
inner enamel epithelium
the peripheral cells of the cap stage or
cuboidal cover the convexity of the cap
and are called the outer enamel
epithelium
so the outer enamel epithelium comes off
cuboidal cells
and the cells in the concavity that is
on the inner side which will
line your ectomycin cells that is your
future dental papilla
is your in your enamel epithelium which
comes off tall columnar cells
so you see cuboidal cells on the outer
side forming the outer enamel epithelium
and you see tall columnar cells on the
inner side forming the inner
epithelium the outer enamel epithelium
is separated from the dental sac
and the inner enamel epithelium from the
dental papilla
by delicate basement membrane hemi
desmosomes anchor the cells to the basal
lamina
the enamel organ may be seen to have a
double attachment of the dental lamina
to the overlying oral epithelium
enclosing the ectomycin kind between
these attachments
this enclosed ectomason kind is called
as enamel niche
this appearance is due to a funnel shape
depression of the
dental lamina so enamel which is a
ecto mesenchymal origin
in gap stage along with the outer and
the inner enamel epithelium we also see
another
layer called as a still reticulum the
polygonal cells which are which we see
in the
butt stage that is the central polygonal
cells which are located in the center of
the epithelial enamel organ
between the outer and inner animal
epithelium will begin to separate
due to water being drawn into this
enamel organ from the surrounding inter
papilla
as a result of osmotic force exerted by
glycoaminoglycans contained in the
ground substance
so these glycosaminoglycans exert
osmotic force
due to which the water is induced into
the enamel organ causing spacing between
the cells in the central polygonal cells
now as a result the polygonal cells will
become star-shaped
but maintain the contact with each other
by their cytoplasmic process
as these starchy cells form a cellular
network
they are called as stellate reticulum
this gives the steady particular a
cushion like consistency
and acts as a shock absorber that may
support and protect
delicate enamel forming cells that is
your amyloplast
now let's talk about four important
temporary structures which you see in
cap stage
the cells in the center of the enamel
organ are densely packed and form the
enamel knot
this knot projects in part towards the
underlying dental papilla
so that the center of the epithelial
invaginations shows a slightly knob like
enlargement
that is border by the labial and the
lingual enamel groups
at the same time a vertical extinction
will be seen from this enamel node and
it's called as enamel cord
a cord it's a cord like so it's an
extension from the enamel knot
when enamel cord extends to me the outer
enamel epithelium
this is called as enamel septum septum
is nothing but a separation
so it is called a septum because it
would divide the stelia reticulum into
two parts because
it travels from to work from the inner
almost from the
enamel epithelium towards the outer and
amino epithelium through
stereotypical it has to pass through the
stellar reticulum so it divides the
stereotype into two parts forming a
septa
hence the scholars enamel septum now the
outer animal epithelium and the point of
meeting shows a small depression
which resembles a naval that is your
umbilicus hence it's called as enamel
navel as it represents the umbilicus
now these structures your enamel
your enamel cord your enamel septum and
an enamel navel are the temporary
structures and are health are also known
as
transitory structures as disappear
before the enamel formation begins
the enamel knot and cord may act as a
reservoir of dividing cells for the
growing enamel organ
now coming to the dental papillion cap
stage under the organizing influence of
the proliferating epithelium of the
enamel organ
the ectomycin kind that is the neural
crest cells that is partially enclosed
by the invaginated portion of the
inner enamel epithelium will start
proliferating it condenses to forms
dental papilla
which is a formative organ organ of what
the dentine and the pulp
now the changes in general papilla occur
hand in hand
with the development of the epithelial
enamel organ
although the epithelium exerts
dominating influence over the adressant
connective tissue
the condensation of the dental papilla
is not a passive crowding due to the
proliferating epithelium
the dental papilla shows the active
budding of capillaries and mitotic
figures
and its peripheral cells adjacent to the
inner animal epithelium
enlarge and later differentiate into
what is the orontoblast that is a
dendine forming
cells there is a marginal condensation
in ectomycin chyme surrounding the
enamel organ
and dental papilla to form what is known
as a dental sac or the
dental follicle gradually in this zone a
denser and more fibrous layer develops
which is a primitive dental sac
as the invagination of the epithelium
deepens and its margins continue to grow
then amino organ assumes a bell shape
four different types of epithelial cells
can be distinguished on light
microscopic examination of the bell
shape of the enamel organ
that is the cells form the inert enamel
epithelium
the stratum intermedium the sterling
reticulum the outer enamel epithelium
now here we see a new member that is the
statin
intermedium the junction between the
inner enamel epithelium and the outer
enamel epithelium is called as the
cervical loop and it is an area of
intense mitotic
activity in the enamel epithelium and
the bell stage conserve a single layer
of cells that differentiate prior to the
amylogenesis
that is a process of formation of enamel
into tall columnar cells called as
amyloblast what are these amyloblasts
again these are the enamel forming cells
these cells are four to five micrometers
in diameter
and about 40 micrometers in height these
elongated cells are attached to one
another by junctional complexes
that laterally enter the cells in statum
intermedium by
desmosomes cells of the
inner enamel epithelium exert an
organizing influence on the underlying
mesenchymal cells in the dental papilla
which later differentiate into
hordondoblas these are the
dentine forming cells a few layers of
squamous cells form the stratum
intermedium
between the inner enamel epithelium and
the stelia reticulum so the statement
intermedium is a new member which we see
in bell stage
and is seen in between the inner enamel
epithelium and the stellar reticulum
these cells are closely attached by
desmosomes and gap junctions
desmosomal junctions are also observed
between cells of the stratum intermedium
stellar reticulum and inner enamel
epithelium
the well-developed cytoplasmic
organelles acid micropolysaccharides and
glycogen deposits indicate a high degree
of metabolic activity
also the cells of this liver are
associated with high activity of
alkaline phosphatase
so where we see a high alpha and
phosphatase activity
in statum intermedium and bell stage the
cells of stratum intermedium works
synergistically with the cells of the
inner enamel epithelium
as a single functional unit and forms
the enamel
it is absent in the part of the two the
germ that outlines the proportion
obviously because the root portion is
covered by cementum instead of enamel
so we usually do not see statum
intermedium in the
part of the two germ that outlines the
root
stellate reticulum expands further
mainly by an increase in
amount of interstellar fluid the cells
are star shaped with a long processes
that anastomose with those of the
adjacent cells
dismosal junctions are observed between
the cells of the sterile reticulum
stratum intermedium and outer enamel
epithelium so we see desmosomal
junctions where
in steady reticulum statum intermedium
and outer enamel epithelium
before the enamel formation begins the
stellate reticulum collapses
reducing the distance between what
between the centrally situated
amyloblast and the nutrient capillaries
near the outer enamel epithelium
its cells then are hardly
distinguishable from those of the
stratum intermedium
this change begins at the height of the
cusp or the incisal edge and progresses
cervically the cells of the outer enamel
epithelium flattened to a low cuboidal
form
at the end of the bell stage preparatory
2 and during the formation of enamel
the formally smooth surface of this
outer enamel epithelium
will form folds so it was it the ideally
the outer animal epithelium surface is
smooth but later at the end of the
bench tree that is a as the bell state
advances you start seeing
folds between these folds the adjacency
of the dental sag
forms a papilla that contain capillary
loops and thus provide a rich
nutritional supply for the intense
metabolic activity of the air vascular
enamel organ
so in the advanced bell stage from where
does the enamel organ gets the nutrient
from
it gets the nutrient from the dental sac
by which which forms a capillary loops
into force forms formed on the surface
of the
outer enamel epithelium this would
adequately compensate the loss of the
nutritional supply from the dental
papilla
over into the formation of mineralized
dentine this change in the nutritional
supply is called as
reversal of nutritional source which we
see in
advanced bell stage that is
from the dental papilla the nutritional
supply goes into the hands of dental
sac the dental amino is seen to extend
lingually and is termed as successional
dental lamina
so it if it extends digitally it gives
rise to your
permanent molasses the extinction of
lingually is called as your
successional lamina as it gives rise to
your
permanent successes of this serious tea
that is your permanent incisors canines
and
premolars in the place of your deciduous
molars the enamel organ of the deciduous
teas in the belt stage show
succession lamina and the permanent
successive teeth in the
bud stage the dental papillion bell
stage is enclosed in the invaginated
portion of the enamel organ
before the enamel epithelium begins to
produce enamel
the peripheral cells of the mesenchymal
dental papilla
differentiate into odontoplast that is
the dendinformin cells
under the organizing influence of the
epithelium
firstly they assume a cuboidal form
later
they assume a columnar form and acquired
the specific potential to produce
dentine
so the dendinformin cells there is blast
are in
column on our shape the dental papilla
ultimately gives us a dental dental pulp
once the dentine formation begins at the
cuspell tip
the basement membrane that separates
enamel organ and the dental papilla just
prior to dentine formation is called as
the
membrana preformativa so membrana
preformativa is nothing but the base
membrane which is present between enamel
organ and the dental papilla
just prior to the dendrine formation
that is pre pre-formative that is
before formation of the dentine
dental sac that is a dental follicle
before the formation of dental tissues
the dental stack
shows a circular arrangement of fibers
and resembles a capsular structure
with the development of root the fibers
of the dental sag differentiate into
periodontal fibers
that becomes embedded into developing
cementum arravular bone which is known
as
sharpies fibers moving on to the
advanced build stage
this state is characterized by
commencement of mineralization and root
formation
during advanced build stage the boundary
between the inner enamel epithelium and
the odonto blast
outlines a future dentino enamel
junction that is the
dej the formation of dentine occurs
first as a layer
along the future deja in the region of
future cusps
and proceeds pulperly and apically after
the first layer of dentine is formed the
amyloblasts which has already
been differentiated from the inner
enamel epithelium lay down the enamel
over the dentine in the future incisal
and cuspell areas
so always remember the enamel formation
begins only
after a first layer of dentine is formed
then animal formation then proceeds
coronally and cervically
in all the regions from the deejay that
is denture enamel junction
towards the surface in addition the
cervical portion of the enamel organ
gives rise to epithelial root sheath of
herdwick
the herdwick's epithelial root sheath
outlines a future root
and is thus responsible for the shape
length size
and number of roots headworks epithelial
root sheet
the development of roots begin after the
enamel and dentine
formation has reached the future cement
enamel junction that is a cj
the enamel organ plays an important part
in the root development by forming
hedworks epithelial root shade
which molds the shape of the roots and
initiates radicular dentine formation
headworks root sheet conserve the outer
and inner enamel epithelium
only so you don't see stellar reticulum
you don't see stratum intermedium you
only see
inner and outer animal epithelium and
therefore it does not include the
statement
in uh stratum intermedium and
stereotypical reticulum the cells of the
inner
layer remains short and normally did not
produce enamel because we don't see an
ammo on the root surface
when these cells have induced the
differentiation of radical dental
papilla cells into odontoblast
and the first layer of dentine has been
laid down the epithelial root sheath
loses its structural continuity
and its close relation to the surface of
the root its remnant processed as an
epithelial network of strands
or clumps near the external surface of
the root these epithelial remnants
are found in the parental ligament of
the erupted teeth
and are called as the stellaris of
malazies so what are the remnants of
headworks epithelial root sheath
are called cell rests of molasses where
do we see
we see in the periodontal ligament of
the adapted
teeth so in crown part after a layer of
dentine is formed
we see the formation of enamel and root
part after a layer of dentinus form
we see loss of structural continuity of
headworks epithelial
root sheath lastly coming to the take
away notes
now the development of tooth includes
histologically
four different stages but stage cap
stage early bell state and advanced
build stage
in butt stage we see two different type
of cells peripheral low column
cells and central polygonal cells and we
see formation of dental papilla and
dental sac that is a dental purple and
dental sac are still in format
forming stages cap stage includes three
different layers outer enamel epithelium
stereo reticulum and inner enamel
epithelium outer enamel epithelium are
low cuboidal in shape
stellate reticulum are star-shaped cells
which forms cellular network
and inner enamel epithelium are tall
columnar cells
in cap stage we see formation of
four trans temporary structures that is
enamel not
enamel called enamel septa and enamel
navel
coming to ld belt stage we see four
different layers that is we see an
addition
out enamel epithelium stiletto stratum
intermedium and nano amino epithelium
again outer enamel epithelium is still
low column cuboid in shape
stereotypical is star-shaped stratum
intermedium forms a layer of squamous
cells and inner enamel epithelium is
column nasals and the events which we
see in early bill stage as the statum
intermedium
which is rich in glycogen helps in
enamel formation the collapse of
stillated reticulum reduces the distance
between the
amyloblasts that is which are formed
from inner enamel epithelium and the
capillaries which are formed on the
surface of the
cells of outer animal epithelium the
outer armor epithelium is laid down into
folds
uh and between of which the mesenchyme
of the dental sag condenses to form
papillae rich in capris which provide
nutritional supply and this called as
reversal in nutritional source
coming to advanced bill stage we see
outer animal epithelium still a
reticulum formation of future denture
enamel junction
and stratum intermedium in enamel
epithelium
the the commencement of mineralization
and root formation is seen in advanced
well stage
we see formation of future denture
enamel junction and the cervical portion
of enamel organ gives rise to your
headwicks epithelial root sheath which
forms the future root
moving on to the mechanism of root
formation after the headworks epithelial
root sheet is formed
from the cervical portion of enamel
organ which primarily consists of inner
and outer enamel epithelium
it later forms epithelial diaphram which
undergoes proliferation and
proliferation to form
roots it can be single root or multiple
roots and the proliferation lags behind
that of the pulpal connective tissue
where it forms the apical foramen
we see the proliferation of cells of
connective tissue of the pulp
which differentiates and odondoplast and
also forms the core of the
pulp hope this session was helpful
