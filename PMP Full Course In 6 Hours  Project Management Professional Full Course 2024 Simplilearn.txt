of project management principles
processes and best practices as outlined
in the project management body of
knowledge PMB guide published by the

associates degree or Global equivalent

leading and directing projects plus 35
hours of project management education
it's essential for candidates to
thoroughly review the exam handbook and
familiarize themselves with Pei's
policies and procedures before
scheduling and taking the PMP exam now
let us discuss about the PMP
certification cost PMP certification
costs wondering what the cost of quality
PMP is PMP cost incurred to earn 35
petas varies from country to country
from doll 300 to do 5,000 reexamination
fee structure
for PMI members1
275 for non- PMI members do
375 a person choosing to become a PMI
member at the time of application will
have to Shell out a PMP price of1
555 which will cover both the
examination and the membership fees
interestingly even if a person doesn't
wish to become a PMI member Hesh will
anyway have to pay the same PMP exam fee
hence we recommend you to apply for the
PMI membership option so that paying
your PMP course fee is more practical
after going through the PMP
certification cost let us next learn
what exactly is its renewal fee so what
is project management now as defined in
pmis PMB project management is
application of knowledge skills tools
and techniques to project activities to
meet project requirements so every
project will have an objective to
accomplish similarly the objective of
project management is to make the final
deliverables in a finite time and budget
this involves having clear understanding
about the deliverables of the project
required resources for the project
resource in terms of Human Resources
Technical Resources Financial Resources
Etc project manager should have a full
picture of those aspects we can call it
as constraints or aspects and manage
those throughout the Project Life Cycle
for which a project manager should have
a full view about a project and what is
that this project has to accomplish that
objective should be clear so as part of
project management the six constraints
which project manager should look at are
scope time quality cost risk and
resources so each of these areas has
very important role to play in project
management the clarity in scope the
clarity in terms of schedule within
which the project has to be delivered
the cost what it incurs to that
particular project once it is finalized
one cannot vary when cannot change
without any proper approvals similar to
that we have quality management which
has to ensure the scope the
specifications what are defined project
output will be accordingly achieved risk
every project is taken up for a specific
reason by organization so organization
should assess the risk associated with
the project and similarly as project
progresses various different risks has
to be identified like Risk related to
project management risk related to
technology area risk related to
resources risk related to financial
things so broadly risk management plays
a very important role so there will be
something called contingency reserve
kept for a identified risk above the
cost what is estimated for various
deliverables from the project so every
project require resources resources may
be in terms of Human Resources Financial
Resources technology resources
environmental resources so all these
resources are used to produce the output
of the project so these resources has to
be managed with the sufficient
optimization and standardizations
required now let us understand the
definition of a project so what is a
project PMI defines a project as a
temporary Endeavor undertaken to create
a unique product service or result the
temporary nature of a project indicates
that a project has a definite beginning
and end so when I say product unique
product it means every output it may be
similar products you are producing with
the same features and functionality but
the output of every project is unique
because it is unique in terms of all the
six constraints what we just discussed
now now when I say product it is very
easy for us to visualize it may be a
desktop it may be a laptop it may be a
car it may be a machine Etc but how do I
visualize a service now project output
is a service now it is it's about
building a capability a project by
through a project a capability can be
built to ensure Services can be provided
that's what the output of project is
service for example if I think about a
taxi services for providing a taxi
services I need a mobile app I need taxi
I need a server I need a data center so
all these are various different products
and services here service example can be
internet service so combination of all
the services and products builds the
capability for an organizations who can
provide the taxes services so building
that capability we say it is an output
of a particular project which is called
service similarly results can be
Improvement of something Improvement in
customer satisfaction increase in um
some specific objectives or specific
results need to be achieved in
performance perspective so output of
every project will be unique product or
a service or a result this we need to
clearly understand so when we say there
is a definite beginning and end every
project starts at certain point in time
and ends at certain point in time so it
has a defate beginning and end that is
the reason it is temporary in nature it
is not an ongoing business activity
before we begin let's have a look at an
incident where two project managers JN
and Ted are talking to each other JN is
a senior project manager while Ted is a
part of his team John finds Ted to be
upset so he asks him is there anything
he can help him with to which Ted
replies that his project failed John
further asks him what could be the
possible reason for the project failure
Ted tells him that that it's because he
was not able to manage the time and
budget now John asks him if he is PMP
certified to which dead says he isn't
then John suggested that he must take
the PMP certification which will not
only give his project better performance
but also help him upskill in his career
so today we will discuss about PMP
certification in detail let's first have
a look at all the topics we will cover
we will begin with what is PMP then we
will check top 10 reasons to get PMP
certified followed by the basics of PMP
then after we know the PMP basic
concepts we will check who can get the
certification and pattern for the PMP
exam then we will learn about the pinbo
guide which is an integral part to
prepare for the PMP exam finally we will
see the cost and the validity of the
certification so without any further Ado
let's begin with what is PMP PMP or
project management professional is the
world's most renowned project management
certification for project managers this
certification is provided by the project
management Institute now when we know
what is project management professional
or PMP certification let's have a look
at some reasons why you should get PMP

reasons to take PMP certification PMP
certification helps you become a better
project manager the process that helps
us acquire the certification goes to
several phases like gaining project
management experience and passing the
PMP exam which helps you in bringing
sanity to the project manager the
process helps project managers to learn
different industry Trends have practical
knowledge and several other project
management constraints the second reason
that we have is project management
certification makes a resume more
valuable as we have discussed earlier
that PMP certification is the most
renowned project management
certification so having it on the resume
will definitely help the interviewer
recognize our skills there are companies
that only accept project managers who
are PMP certified PMP certification not
only helps in switching the job or
finding a new one it helps in
progressing in the current company as
well the third reason that we have is it
provides more job opportunities when one
acquires the PMP certification it proves
that one has expertise in completing the
project effectively and efficiently so
the certification increases the trust
factor of the interviewer in you and
increases your probability of getting
that job the fourth reason that we have
is salary hikes PMP certified project
manager is one of the highest paid jobs
around the globe and this trend will
continue to grow the global survey by
the project management Institute shows
that PMP certified project managers tend
to get 20% more salary than the
non-certified project managers the next
reason that we have is PMP certification
validates your dedication to the job the
certification requires several months of
training it requires several hours of
project management experience and
exposure this experience and exposure
explains the seriousness of a project
manager towards its career path then

jobs in different types of Industries
all over the world PMP certification not
only provides theoretical knowledge but
also helps in gaining practical
knowledge which further helps in
increasing the confidence of a project
manager the next reason that we have is
better project performance PMP certified
project managers tend to deliver better
projects than the non- PMP certified
project managers this is because PMP
certified project managers are well
aware of five process groups 10
knowledge areas and 49 processes which
helps them have a clear picture of
different aspects involved in a project
the eighth reason that we have is it
increases your networking opportunities
there are several communities that one
becomes a part of when they sign up as a
PMI member these communities have
meetings regarding new job opportunities
and this helps in having a professional
Network the ninth reason that we have is
job security job security is a major
reason that a professional thinks of
before opting for a particular
profession today in the world of
recession where companies are drowning
the demand for PMP certified project
managers goes on increasing the last and
the 10th reason we have is expertise in
practical application when one appears
for a PMP exam they need extensive
preparation they need to have thorough
knowledge of process groups and
knowledge areas which help them develop
several essential skills and move ahead
in their career now as we move further
we will look into the PMP basic concepts
the PMP basic concept concepts are the
five project management steps these
project management steps start from the
day we begin our project to the day we
end our project they begin from
initiation to closure the first step
that we have is initiation planning
execution monitoring and controlling and
closure now let's have a look at each of
them in detail the first step we have is
initiation initiation involves defining
the project scope this is the step where
we explain what our project will have
for whom we are making that project
project it helps us to identify our
stakeholders who all will be the part of
that project and determine the project
feasibility after the step of initiation
when we have decided the scope of a
project the Second Step that comes is
planning in the planning phase we Define
a flow to all the activities of a
project we Define this flow keeping in
mind all the constraints of a project
like time resources and risk after we
have defined the flow of these processes
it is time for us to look at the
execution in the execution phase we
evaluate the plan and the sequence of
the task we have made we finally put the
plan in action and the project tends to
start after the project building has
started and the process of execution has
started it is time for the monitoring
and the controlling phase in monitoring
and controlling phase the progress of
the project is tracked and important
steps for quality assurance are taken in
monitoring and controlling phase the
work being done is compared with the
work as defined in the project plan in
this phase the progress of the project
is tracked and important steps for
quality assurance are taken finally we
have the closure step in this step the
deliverables are delivered to the client
the documentation of all that took place
during the Project Life Cycle is done
and project is fully evaluated now when
we have seen reasons for getting PMP
certified and we know the basic concepts
of PMP it is time for us to know who can
get PMP certified for getting PMP
certified there can be two cases the
first case says You must have a
secondary degree a secondary degree
means high school diploma or an
associate degree or a degree that is
globally equivalent to all of these then
you need to have 7500 hours of leading
and directing projects and 3500 hours of
project management education there can
be two cases first case can be you must
have a secondary degree that means a
high school diploma associates degree or
the global equivalent degree then you
must have 7500 hours of project
management experience and 35 hours of
Education in project management the
second case can be you must have a
4-year degree along with 4,500 hours of
project management experience and 35
hours of Education in project management
now when we know who can get PMP
certified we will see the PMP exam
pattern the exam comprises of 200
questions out of which 175 questions are
used for evaluation one can answer these
questions if they have thorough
knowledge of five process groups and 10
knowledge areas the time provided to
complete the exam is 4 hours the
questions that are asked are of
different types the most common type
being formula based situation based and
knowledge based now when we have
discussed about the exam pattern
discussing about the pinbo guide becomes
very important so the next topic that we
have is pinbo guide pinbo guide or
project management body of knowledge is
a book that comprises of several
processes and different terminologies
needed to crack the PMP exam the whole
syllabus of PMP exam is covered in the
pinbo guide by the project management
and 10 knowledge areas apart from this
there are 49 processes that are divided
amongst five process groups 10 knowledge
areas finally let's have a look at the
cost and validity of the PMP
certification when we talk about the
cost of the certification there can be
two cases the the first case can be if
we are not a member of project
management Institute the exam fees is
$555 the second case can be if we are a
member of project management Institute
the exam fees is
$45 if we talk about the validity of the
certification the certificate is valid
for a period of 3 years after every 3
years the certificate needs to be
renewed to renew the certificate one
needs to furnish a proof of 60 pdus of
professional development units after so
much information that thanks John for
his time and Promises to take the PMP
certification at the shortest notice now
let's have a look at the salary trends
of a PMP certified project manager and a
sample resumer if we consider the salary
of a non- PMP certified project manager
it is approximately
$91,000 while if we consider the salary
of a PMP certified project manager it is
approximately
$111,000 which is approximately 20%
higher than the non-certified project
manager salary now let's have a look at
the resume of a p PMP certified project
manager if you're somebody with PMP
certification and looking for a project
manager or a senior project manager role
your resume should look something like
this the summary in the beginning would
include how much experience you have and
anything that supports your claim of
being a project manager like here James
Brown has written he has more than 10
years of experience with generating and
building projects then when you talk
about your experience you should put
something that emphasizes on the
responsibilities that you had your area
of expertise put something that shows
your skill set for the desire post and
also something that you learned from
your former job role this shows that you
have command over your work and also the
determination to skill and upskill
yourself like here James Brown has 3
years of experience as an assistant
manager training new Associates and then
more than three years of experience as a
project manager where he not only leted
projects but also learn new project
management tools like Trello and Prima
vera after this add relevant information
regarding your education your resume
must include skills that you have or you
have gained in your years of experience
like here James Brown has divided his
skills into two parts where he has
written his technical skills and
non-technical skills he has included a
skill of agile and quality assurance
software as well as he has his knowledge
of different project management tools
then putting your certifications play a
major role this proves that you're up
toate and updated with current market
trends James Brown has his
certifications in C and Java and more
importantly he has his project
management certification project
management professional here's Max an
assistant project manager who looks
tensed and is pacing around the room
then Jack a project manager who works
with him walks into the room and asks
him why does he seem so tensed to which
Max replies he's facing difficulty in
estimating the budget Jack responds it
might be because he's not planning the
project properly Jack reassures Max and
begins to tell him about project
planning so without any further Ado
let's begin with what is Project
planning project planning is the second
step or phase of the Project Life Cycle
Project Life Cycle has five different
phrases from initiation to closure today
we will be learning about this phase
that comes immediately after initiation
in which the project plan is documented
and further requirements are defined
project planning includes the following
things the first and the foremost thing
is describing the objectives or outputs
we are expecting the project to yield
second we have is the elaboration of the
scope to make sure what the project is
all about and what all can be expected
from the project the third step we have
is forming a schedule this schedule is
important to run or perform different
tasks of a project each task having its
own start date and end date this helps
the project to finish in the scheduled
time and limit lastly we have making and
generating progress reports in which all
that went during the tenure of the
project is documented this helps in
evaluating the project and helps in the
forthcoming projects now let's have a
look at the project planning
fundamentals the First Fundamental that
we have is the determination of scope
cost and resources the determination
helps us in having a rough estimate
about the time that is required to
finish the project it helps us in
determining the number of people
required and what should be their skill
set we can divide the project into
smaller manageable sections and this is
made possible with the help of work
breakdown structure the second
fundamental refers to identifying the
problem there are several techniques by
which we can collect information and
discover issues there may be several
problems in a project and in that case
several risks or issues are prioritized
and the risk that requires immediate
attention is dealt with first then comes
identification of stakeholders when we
can identify the stakeholders we can
know who all will be affected and in
what way which helps us having a better
understanding of the project
stakeholders may be anybody they may be
the part of the project team or project
managers or customers they help during
the project and contribute to its
success then the last fundamental we
will discuss is defining project
objectives a project plan is made
keeping in mind the requirements of the
project team and expectations of the
stakeholders if the project team can
meet the expectations of the
stakeholders then only we can say that
the project is successful now when we
know about project planning and its
fundamentals it's time to see why
project planning is so important project
planning reduces the cost and time of
the project as every step is monitored
and optimized in the best possible
manner project planning increases
employee satisfaction as every employee
who is a part is engaged in the team for
improved project performance project
planning helps in the implementation of
quality assurance as the output of every
step is duly tested lastly project
planning helps in reducing project risk
as plan planning helps to analyze
prioritize and deal with that risk
moving on let's have a look at the tools
for project planning the first tool that
we have is a gan chart today Gan charts
are one of the most popular project
management tools they help in tracking
the status of the work at a particular
time and their independencies on each
other Gan charts help in showing
different phases and steps involved in a
project the second tool we will talk
about is critical path method or CPM
critical path method helps in scheduling
the project activities so that the
project runs properly the critical path
method focuses on the longest stretch of
dependent tasks and determines the time
needed to complete them the next tool is
Project evaluation and review technique
or per chart per provides a graphical
representation of the Project's timeline
explaining the independencies of
different tasks this tool not only helps
in making a schedule but also helps in
coordinating with all the team members
the four tool we will check is work
breakdown structure work breakdown
structure is a very common tool that
makes it possible for the team to break
its work into manageable sections work
breakdown structure is a step toep
process that helps in completing the
project efficiently the last tool we
will see is Project documentation
project documentation is an integral
part of the project life cycle project
documentation helps in understanding the
mistakes done during the project and
more importantly provides guidelines for
the upcoming project now when we know
about different tools for project
planning it becomes essential that we
know the necessary steps of project
planning there are seven steps in
Project planning let's have a look at
each of them in detail the first step is
identification of stakeholders as we
have discussed stakeholders could be
anybody they could be a part of the team
or a project manager or a customer when
we identify stakeholders we can find out
the expectations and requirements that
are to be looked upon in this project
this gives us a clearer picture of the
project and helps in establishing the
project scope so the next step we have
is defining the project scope this helps
in determining a list of specific
project goals and deliverables that are
to be achieved during the course of the
project after we have defined the
project scope it is time to set project
objectives and prioritize them the
initial ideas that were there before are
now elaborated and final steps to
complete the project are defined in the
next step the deliverables are
determined after all project
deliverables are the only reason why the
project is being created this step
involves finding out what these
deliverables will be and the deadlines
of their delivery then the step that
comes into picture is creating a project
schedule the project schedule refers to
the guidelines when a particular task is
to be started and when it is supposed to
end this helps in monitoring the growth
of the project and later helps in
generating progress reports the next
step is the step of risk analysis this
step plays an extremely important role
in the success of the overall project it
helps in identifying the risk
prioritizing them and taking steps to
limit them the last step in Project
planning is to generate progress reports
in this step we update the stakeholders
about about the project growth and it is
done so that all the concerned team
members can have a look at the progress
of the project after all this
information Max thanks Jack for the
explanation and looks forward to plan
projects within the budget and of better
quality now let us learn about project
management in Excel Microsoft Excel is
one of the most common application these
days it is used in both offices and at
homes Microsoft Excel is an easy project
management tool that allows the team
members to easily see the tasks in a
project develop a plan and track its
progress before we learn more about
project management in Excel let's first
have a look why do we use Excel
Microsoft Excel is an easy tool to plan
a project so it can be used by people
who are beginners in terms of project
management in Excel one can find several
analytical tools like concatenate Len
and counter so this makes data analysis
easy and effective as the entry of data
is easy same is tracking and controlling
of project status then there are several
project management templates in Excel
that help us to have an effect
distribution of project data we will be
checking several project management
templates towards the end of this video
now let's have a look at the process of
making a Gant chart in Excel before we
begin this it's important we know what
is a Gant chart a Gant chart is like an
horizontal bar chart that is used for
project management with the help of a
Gant chart we can check the status of
the task the date they start the date
they end and their dependencies on each
other Gan chart helps in coordinating
and monitoring different tasks in a
project now let's have a look at the
steps that will help us in making a Gant
chart first step we have is make a
project table we have several rows and
columns like here we have three columns
in the First Column we have the tasks in
the second we have a start date and in
the third column we have the duration or
tenure of the task the second step is to
make a bar chart in Excel for this we
will select the entire second column
then we will go on the insert Tab and
click on the bar graph chart there we
can select stacked bar graph in 2D bar
charts as a result we will have the
entitled bar graph on the screen in the
third step we will add the duration to
the bar graph we will right click on the
chart and in the menu that appears we
will select select data option a window
that appears on the screen in that
window we will select add option as
shown we can also see the start date is
already in the entry section then in the
dialog box that appears type tenure in
the series name and click on the Range
selection icon that's shown in the
figure now select the relevant data from
the tenure column and click on okay now
we can see a bar graph that has two
colors on the screen this bar graph now
has the duration of the tasks the fourth
step we have is adding description to
the Gant chart now we will open the box
again and in that box we will select the
edit option as shown in the figure then
we will select the tasks as we had
selected the duration of the tasks
before and click on okay we can now see
the tasks have appeared towards the left
side of the Gan chart the fifth and the
remarkable step will help us convert
this bar graph into a gan chart we will
now click on the bars and select the
format data series option from the menu
that appears then in the format data
series this dialog box we will select no
fill option we can find our Gan chart on
the screen now in accordance with the
data that we had entered now we can see
the tasks on the left side are in the
reverse order so what we will do next is
we will click on the task panel then go
to the format xess dialog box and select
the categories in reverse order option
now we can find our tasks in the right
order one more thing we can notice is
Gan chart is starting with some other
date and not with the dates that we had
entered so for this we will copy the
first date in some other cell then
clicking on the copied cell we will go
to the home menu to select the dialog
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop- down menu we will select the
number option we can now find a value
displayed in the copied cell we will
copy that value click on the dates on
the chart and as the format access
dialog box opens we will paste that
value in the box that says minimum shown
in the figure as a result we will have
our final Gan chart on the screen in the
last step we can give several designs to
a Gand chart change colors and make it
more presentable for us now when we know
the basic steps of making a Gant chart I
will show that practically to you in
Microsoft Excel our first step is to
open Microsoft Excel and in Microsoft
Excel we will make a project table in a
project table we will have three columns
the First Column will be task the second
column will have the start date the
third column will have tenure or the
duration of the task so beginning with
tasks we have task one in task one we
have 1.1 1.2 1.3 then comes task 2 in
task 2 we have 2.1 2.2 2.3 and 2.4 then
we have task three in task three we will
have two subsections 3.1 and 3.2 then we
will start with the starting dates in
starting dates we'll put 1st January the
Task 1 1.1 will be 1st of January then
this will be 4th January let's say this
is 5th January then we will put this as
11th of January and this will be again
11th January only this will be 15th
January let's put this as 17th January
let this be 19th January task 3 begins
on 23rd January and it the 3.2 section
begins at 26th of January now let's put
the tenure or the duration of the task
we will begin with task one it takes 12
days then 1.1 takes 7 days we say this
takes 4 days and this takes 8 days then
for task two it again takes 12 days it
takes 5 days 5 days and let's say this
takes 6 days and this takes 4 days then
we come to task three this takes 8 days
and let's say this takes 6 days and the
3.2 section takes 5 days so this is how
our project table is ready in the second
step we will select the entire second
column after we have selected this
column we will go to the insert tab tab
in the insert tab we'll go to the bar
columns and in this we will select 2D
staged bar charts now we have the
entitled bar chart in accordance to our
data on the screen then comes the third
step we will add the duration of the
tasks to the bar graph we will click on
the chart and after we click on the
chart we will select select data option
in the select data source dialog box we
find the start date is already there now
we will click on ADD and after we click
on add in the series name section we
will put tenure then in the series value
we will click on this icon and select
the entire tenure series and click on
okay so this is the bar graph that we
have now this is now in two colors the
orange color and the blue color this bar
graph now has the duration of all the
tasks in our project table now in the
fourth step now it's time for us to add
description to our Gan chart instead of
this 1 2 3 4 5 we will put task one task
two and the subtasks so what we will do
is we will again go to that box we will
left click on the Gand chart select the
select data option and then we'll go to
the start date here we'll select the
edit option in the edit option we will
select all the tasks and click on okay
now we can see all the tasks are aligned
towards the left of the bar chart as we
can see this is a bar chart or a bar
graph and not a Gand chart the next step
we have is converting this bar Gra graph
into a Gant chart so we will click on
the bars and select the format data
series option from the menu that appears
here we have this format data series
option now we can see the dialogue box
on the screen here we'll go into the
color section fill section and then we
will select no fill now we can see the
blue lines have disappeared so this
looks like a Gant chart so now when we
have a gan chart on the screen we can
notice that the task here are in the
reverse order so what we will do is we
will click on these tasks and select the
format X as option here we will select
categories in reverse order we can see
our Gan chart is now in order like we
have our task one on the top and task
three at the bottom the dates are
starting from 11th of December but the
dates we have provided are from 1st of
January now we will copy this cell then
go on the dates box here we'll go to
format access in the format access we
can see minimum in this minimum we will
paste this value and press enter as we
press enter we can see our Gand chart
starting from the date that we wanted to
start and that to in the correct order
starting from task one to task three now
as a result we have our final Gand chart
on the screen in the last step what we
can do is make our Gand chart more
representable we can change the color of
These Bars we can give them shapes and
we can do many other things to make it
more presentable we will first select
the bars like what we will do is we will
select task one and let's say we give it
the color blue then task two we will
give it color green and in task three
we'll give it give it the color black so
here the subsections will give different
colors to the subsections as well then
we come to task 2.1 this is how we can
change the color of these cells or apart
from changing colors we can select a bar
graph and do the gradient fill so this
is how we can make a Gan chart more
presentable after changing the colors or
changing the shapes we have our final
Gan chart on the screen finally let's
have a look at some Microsoft Excel
templates for project management
Microsoft Excel templates help in
collecting data putting them into order
and check their dependencies with each
other with the help of these templates
we can monitor the status of the tasks
and we can also check the progress our
project has made moving forth we will
check some important Microsoft Excel
templates the first template we have is
Excel project review template this
template helps us have an overview of
the project we can have a clear
understanding of all the tasks that are
planned and that are completed this
helps project managers to measure the
progress of the project and take further
steps accordingly second template we
will check is Excel budget template in
this template we can monitor all the
expenditures of our project it helps us
in managing the budget of a project and
also helps in comparing the budget of a
project at different phases let's have a
look at the budget template in Excel
once we can download this template from
office timeline.com the Gant chart
towards the right is in accordance with
the dates towards the left if we
fluctuate the date we can see the
template working the start date for task
one could be changed to 10th June if we
change this date to 10th June we can see
the fluctuation in the grand chart so
this is how we can use this template
directly let's have a look at the third
template now third template we will see
is Excel Sprint Project tracker template
this template is used majorly in agile
projects where the project is made in
several Sprints or sessions this
template includes the start date the end
date and the duration of each task we
can also see the percentage completed of
each task let's have a look at this
Sprint Project tracker template as well
we can see the Gan chart towards the
right and the data towards the left so
if we change any data we can see the
Gant chart changing for example we can
change the data in Sprint 2 feature 3
let's change the start date to July 2 we
can see the Gant chart changing this is
how we can use this template directly to
track our sessions let's have a look at
the fourth Excel template this template
is Excel project tracker in this
template we have the data of all the
tasks with their status and owners we
can track the percentage of task
completed and also compare the planned
duration of the task to the actual
duration of the task after the critical
part tracker let's check the Excel
project schedule template this template
helps in effective management of the
project as it helps in monitoring the
time that each task of the project takes
it provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel ones we
can see the Gan chart in accordance to
the data if we change the estimated
hours at two places let's say at the
design review we make it 15 hours
instead of 5 hours and at the create
Staffing plan we make it 2 hours instead
of 20 hours we can see the Gant chart
fluctuating this is how we can use this
template to manage the schedule in a
project moving forward the next template
we will see is Excel project status
report template this template helps us
having a list of project deliverables
and the risks associated with that
project this template helps the project
managers about different crucial
activities involved in a project after
this we have Excel Milestone tracker the
Milestone tracker helps us in tracking
or monitoring different tasks in a
project project managers use this
template to monitor the project
performance with respect to the
timelines the last template we will see
is Excel project planner Excel project
planner includes a list of tasks with
the respected owners along with the
start date and the end date of that task
this helps in monitoring each task and
comparing the estimated task date with
the actual ones let's have a look at
this template in Excel we can see the
Gan chart with respect to the data
entered let's make changes at several
places in the data we can make this 22
to 24 we will make this 23 go to 2 and
we can make this 5th September go to
15th September and when we make the
changes we can realize the Gan chart is
fluctuating so this is how we can use
this template to plan a project
effectively and efficiently if you are
looking to become a skilled project
manager have a look at the postgraduate
program in project management by simply
lar a project is a temporary Endeavor
undertaken to create a unique product
service or result for example developing
a new product service or result
constructing a building industrial plant
or infrastructure and implementing
improving or enhancing existing business
processes and procedures in the next
screen we will focus on the
characteristics of a
project a project can be distinguished
based on its
characteristics the definition describes
two characteristics of a project first
it is temporary in nature temporary here
does not mean short in duration a
project can extend for long duration
based on the requirements for example
creating a new indigenous missile
defense system for a country however
there is always a definite plan start
and end date for a project it cannot go
on
indefinitely secondly the project is
supposed to produce a unique output the
output could be a product service or
result there can be many common
activities between two projects but the
outcome of each project should be unique
in some way or the other now let us look
at what marks the end of a project a
project ends when either the objectives
are met or the project is terminated
because the objectives will not or
cannot be met the other reason to
terminate the project can be that the
need for the output of the project does
not exist anymore usually the sponsor of
the project takes a call about the
closure of the project it is important
to differentiate Project work from
regular operational work for example
your office receptionist does the same
work every day of picking any incoming
call and directing the call to the right
person in the office this is an ongoing
repetitive work and can be classified as
operation operations unlike projects are
neither temporary nor unique creating a
new software system to effectively track
your customer complaint can be an
example of a project when the software
is successfully developed the project
objective is met which marks the end of
the project
when you start using this software to
track customer complaints you are
entering into the operations phase in
the next screen let us now look into
project
management as defined in the pmbok guide
project management is the application of
knowledge skills and tools and
techniques applied to project activities
to meet the project requirements project
management is achieved by proper
application and integration of the 47
processes
project application and integration
means these processes should be executed
in the right manner as well as in the
right order in the next screen let us
discuss how to manage a
project program management is defined as
the application of knowledge skills
tools and techniques to a program to
meet the program requirements and to
obtain benefits and control not
available by managing projects
individually as defined in pinbo guide a
program is a group of related projects
which when managed as a group in a
coordinated fashion provides benefits
and control that are not available while
managing them individually these
benefits could be from decreased risk
economies of scale improved management
of dependencies delivery of additional
capabilities optimal utilization of
shared resources and so on let us now
learn the various features of program
management random projects cannot be
grouped together as a program the
projects in a program should be related
in some way or the other and there
should be some value added in managing
them together a project may not be a
part of any program but a program will
always have projects a project can also
be executed as a standalone project a
program is designed to deliver some
strategic benefits value to the
organization these benefits can be
tangible or intangible examples of
tangible benefit could be increased
profit margins or operational cost
savings examples of intangible benefits
could be improved team morale or
building up certain
competencies while a project manager
focuses relentlessly on the Fulfillment
of the Project's requirements that is
scope cost time quality a program
manager needs to focus on ensuring that
the organizational benefits are realized
in the next screen let us understand
what a portfolio is portfolio is yet
another term used along with project and
program a portfolio may have multiple
projects and programs that are managed
as a group to achieve strategic
objectives note that all projects and
programs in a portfolio may not be
necessarily interdependent or directly
related a portfolio can be created based
on the business objectives
for example an IT service company can
have a portfolio named Japanese projects
which is formed with an aim to take over
the Japanese Market by giving more
attention to these projects within this
portfolio similar projects can be
managed as a program and all banking
projects from Japan can be managed as a
banking program in the next screen let
us discuss portfolio management
portfolio management is the central
centralized management of one or more
portfolios this includes identifying
prioritizing authorizing managing and
controlling projects programs and other
related work to achieve strategic
business
objectives therefore whether the company
should have Japanese projects as
portfolio or not is decided by portfolio
Management in the next screen let us
understand the relationship between
portfolios programs and projects
the image on the screen will help you to
understand the terms portfolios programs
and projects a portfolio is part of an
organization's overall strategy it
represents a conscious decision by an
organization to invest in the portfolio
the overall objectives of a portfolio
are then cascaded down to the lower
level components the components could be
sub portfolios programs or projects
these components can further be broken
down into smaller components for ease of
management although a project may not
contain operations a program or a
portfolio it can include other work this
other work May comprise training and
development customer support and
services Etc if the other work has
Synergy with the overall objectives and
adds to the capability to deliver the
higher level benefits then it can be
included in the program or port
portfolio as well in the next screen we
will discuss project management
office project management office or pmo
is a specific type of body or Department
within an organization pmo performs
several roles in the organization and
these can broadly be classified as
primary roles and other roles typically
the pmo may take up any one or a
combination of the three primary roles
it provides the policies methodologies
and tools and templates for managing
projects within the organization it
provides support and training in
organization on how to manage projects
and finally it provides project managers
for different ongoing projects in the
organization pmo may also help in
managing interdependencies between the
projects selecting managing and
deploying shared or dedicated project
resources
if need be terminating a project and
organizing Lessons Learned sessions and
maintaining the project management
knowledge base for an organization in
the next screen we will discuss how to
manage the triple
constraints any project can be done
successfully if there is no constraint
on time or there is unlimited budget
available unfortunately that is not true
in real life a project is performed
within some constraint and these
constraints are usually competing
therefore if you change one it would
affect the other for example if the
project duration increases it would lead
to increase in the project cost as well
triple constraint is a term that
originally referred to the three
competing project constraints within
which the projects are performed these
constraints are cost time and scope
quality is a primary concern for a
project
manager therefore the project manager
has to make tradeoffs to keep the scope
cost time quality plane in Balance to
achieve the balance the project manager
also needs to manage other aspects of
the project for instance the people
stakeholders risks communication and
procurements the project manager plays
the essential role of integrating all
these different aspects of project
management
in the PMP examination you can expect
business scenario based questions
focusing on the triple constraints in
the next screen let us understand who a
stakeholder is a stakeholder can be
defined as the one whose interests May
positively or negatively be affected or
perceived to be affected by the decision
activity or outcome of the project as
per the definition the project team
project manager project SP sponsor pmo
Office customer Etc are the stakeholders
of the project a project sponsor is the
one who gives a go-ahead for a project
and provides the necessary resources to
execute the project therefore the head
of projects in the organization who
provides a green signal to start a
project and allocates required resources
to the project is the project sponsor a
project sponsor is usually somebody
placed high up in the organizational
High Archy of the Performing
organization that is the organization in
which the work of the project is being
carried out in the next screen let us
look at stakeholder
management one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to manage stakeholders a project manager
has to involve the stakeholders from the
beginning of the project until the end
so they are aware of every step a
project manager has to take up specific
activities for stakeholders
management identifying both internal and
external
stakeholders missing out any stakeholder
can be disastrous for a project a
stakeholder who has identified towards
the end of the project may come up with
his own requirement at that stage and
incorporating them can be risky
determining stakeholder requirements
after identifying all the stakeholders
the project manager also needs to ensure
that their requirements are clearly
identified sometimes stakeholders might
themselves not know of their requirement
and it is the job of the project manager
to get them right by doing a proper
stakeholder requirement
analysis determining stakeholder
expectations stakeholders might also
have some unstated
expectations which need to be clarified
to see if it can become a project
requirement it is again the role of the
project manager to determine the
stakeholders
expectation communicating with
stakeholders once all the stated and
unstated stakeholder requirements are
known the project manager as part of
stakeholder analysis should focus on
communicating them regularly to keep
stakeholders involved in the project
once you understand the practices of
stakeholder management it will be easier
for you to answer scenario-based
questions in the examination in the next
screen let us look at the various
organiz ganization structure projects
are performed in an organization and the
functioning of the organization might
affect the project the different
organization structured types explained
here are based on the level of authority
that a project manager gets into in
those
organizations in a functional type of
organization the organization is grouped
by the area of specialization within
different functional areas for instance
marketing accounting engineering Etc are
departments within the organization each
employee typically reports to a
functional manager in such types of
organization normally projects are
undertaken within the department itself
if a project requires any assistance
from another department the request
moves from the head of the requesting
Department to the head of the concerned
Department the team members do their
normal departmental work in addition to
the project work the next type of
organiz oranization is projectized
organization in such organizations there
are no departments the organizations
resources mostly work on projects team
members report to a project manager the
project manager has complete control
over the resources when the project is
completed either they move on to another
project or they look for some job
outside the company they do not have a
department for themselves the third type
of organization is a Matrix organization
which is a blend of functional and
projectized organizational structure a
team member belongs to a department as
well as they are part of a project team
in such organization team members have
two bosses one their department head and
the second their project manager since
there are two bosses here this type of
organization is further classified into
three different types they are are weak
strong and balanced Matrix
organization so out of the two bosses
that team members have in Matrix
organization if the project manager has
more authority over the team member such
organizations are called strong Matrix
where the functional manager has more
Authority it's a weak Matrix
organization if they both share equal
Authority then it is a balanced
organization there is another term that
you might find in the exam called tight
Matrix this generally refers to a
collocated team that is a team that has
been placed in the same location to
enhance their performance in the PMP
exam if there is no mention of the
organization type you can assume it to
be a matrix
organization let us look at each of
these organization structures in detail
in the next screen let us look at
functional
organization in a functional
organization the resources of the
organization are grouped by functions
sometimes called departments examples of
functions could be sales Finance
Administration manufacturing Etc each
function plays a definite role in the
organization and is headed by a
functional head or supervisor all the
resources in such an organization report
directly into their functions therefore
A salesperson would report into the
sales organizational hierarchy
a purchase executive would report into
procurement and so on you would notice
that in a functional organization the
project manager's role is not explicitly
called out when a functional
organization embarks on a project each
of the functions that are involved May
volunteer some resources to work on the
project one of these resources may end
up playing the project manager's role
the resource assignments may not even be
full-time and sometimes times even the
project manager is part-time since the
project manager has no authority over
any of the resources they are dependent
on the functional heads this makes it
more challenging for the project manager
to coordinate in the team however
functional organizations provide an
opportunity for specialization for
example if a purchase executive was
reporting into the purchase Department
that executive would have exposure to
all the purchasing that happens within
the organization and has a well- defined
career path in functional organizations
project management happens at the
functional head level next let us look
at the projectized organization in the
next
screen the projectized organization has
all the resources aligned around
projects the project managers have
complete control over the resources
working on their projects the biggest
advantage of the the projectized
organization is that the resources have
loyalty to their projects and project
execution becomes easier this kind of
structure is suitable for organizations
whose work is in the nature of projects
there are few disadvantages in this
structure as well firstly the role of
the resource is over once the project is
completed secondly highly specialized
roles within a project may not be fully
occupied all the time for for example a
purchase executive may have worked for
selected periods on a project while
purchase activities are going on however
for the rest of the period their
capability may not be optimally utilized
there is less scope for functional
specialization as the project boundaries
limit the kind of work for the
resources each project manager is in
charge of a project and its
resources next let us look at the Matrix
organization in a matrix organization
the resources report to the functional
managers and are managed by the project
managers as well there might even be a
function that represents all the project
managers in the organization which
provides project management
expertise The Matrix structure has three
variants commonly referred to as weak
balanced and strong in a weak Matrix the
authority of the project manager is the
weakest and strongest in a strong Matrix
structure
the titles given to project managers and
functional or weak Matrix organizations
are project expediter or project
coordinator they would be called project
managers in a balanced or strong Matrix
structure and have slightly more
authority over the time of the team
members the advantage of the Matrix
structure is that resources can be
optimally utilized while preserving the
capacity of the project managers to get
projects executed efficiently resources
can specialize in their functions and
have stability in their careers also
contribute to the projects at the same
time potentially the disadvantage of
Matrix organization is that the
communication overhead increases
significantly this is because every
resource in the organization belongs
into a project and into a function
leading to a dual reporting structure in
a matrix organiz iation project
management happens at project resource
level in the next screen let us
summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of different
organizational
structures each organization structure
has its own set of advantages and
disadvantages the advantage of
functional organizations is that
resources may find clearly defined
career paths and Achieve specialization
and skill development in their
respective fields it will be a flexible
Workforce since only one manager will be
responsible avoiding confusion the
disadvantage of such organization type
is that project work is hampered
Department work is always given higher
priority than the project work in
addition there is no career path in
project management which leads to lower
interest in projects in the case of the
projectized organization one of the
clear advantages is better communication
within the project projects since
Project work is the only work team
members are doing it also leads to
loyalty towards the project goals the
disadvantage of such organization type
is the inefficient use of resources
because every project team has their own
support function therefore this might
lead to the duplication of effort it
also leads to the resources being left
with no work since their roles are over
once the project is completed it also
hampers skill development because the
project requirements dictate what kind
of work team members perform at
different stages on a project now let us
look at the Matrix organization it also
has the advantage of better coordination
and maximum utilization of
resources however the disadvantage is
the higher potential for conflict among
the managers which might lead to
communication complexity and overhead
Management in the next screen let us
focus on the comparison on Project Life
Cycle and product life cycle Project
Life Cycle spans the initiation of a
project until the closure of the project
the product life cycle on the other hand
also encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases a typical product
life cycle starts with conception of the
product and goes until it's withdrawal
from the market the withdrawal might be
because it becomes obsolete or there is
no further need for for the product in
the market a product has a long life
cycle a product can require or spawn
many projects over its life for example
a project in product conception phase
could be to determine customer needs
whereas a project during product
maturity phase could be used to perform
competitive analysis typically a product
life cycle is longer than the Project
Life Cycle a project also has its own
life cycle and this life cycle depends
upon the industry and the organization
within which the project is being
executed sometimes different
organizations within the same industry
use different life cycles there can be
questions in the exam based on the
comparison of Project Life Cycle and
product life cycle so understanding the
differences will be useful in answering
such questions in the next screen let us
discuss more on Project Life Cycle a
life cycle is composed of phases each
phase represents a discrete unit of work
required to be done on the project there
are different ways of classifying
project life cycles let us first discuss
the sequential versus overlapping life
cycle in sequential phases the
subsequent phase starts only after the
previous phase has been completed
whereas in overlapping phases two or
more phases may run in parallel for some
time this could help fast tracking and
compressing the amount of time required
the other way of classifying life cycles
is how they go about the process of
planning in predictive life cycles there
is a large upfront planning phase where
all the details of scope cost time are
planned before beginning the subsequent
phases these phases then are executed in
either sequential or overlapping modes
they are suitable for large projects
where all the requirements are likely to
be known in advance and where upfront
planning effort is required to get the
necessary approvals another feature of
predictive life cycles is that each
phase May potentially be different in
the nature of activities and may require
people with different skill sets for
example traditional software development
life cycle has phases like requirements
feasibility planning design construction
testing and transition
we will continue project life cycles in
the next screen incremental and edive
life cycles have a short upfront
highlevel definition and planning phase
the product is then developed through a
series of iterations where iteration
increments or adds to the functionality
by a little all the activities are
intentionally repeated in
iterations adaptive or agile life cycles
are variants of incremental and
iterative life cycles where iteration is
very short typically 2 to 4 weeks agile
methodologies are becoming very popular
in the software development industry and
in other Industries where the
requirements are highly changeable and
frequent feedback is
beneficial let us now check your
understanding of the topics covered in
this lesson a project manager is
supposed to fulfill a Project's
requirements that is to deliver a unique
output in a timely manner it starts in
the form of an idea that is approved by
a project initiator or sponsor the
project manager and the project team
then elaborate their understanding of
the requirements and produce the final
deliverable which can be a product a
service or a result throughout the
project the project management team
needs to ensure that the stakeholders
are engaged in the project and their
expectations are being managed the
project management team also needs to
ensure that there is good communication
between the project team and the
stakeholders in addition the team should
make sure that the constraints of scope
cost time quality and others are
balanced in addition to producing
deliverables a project generates data
such historical data archives or records
are important for planning future
projects there are five major process
groups in project management in the next
screen we will discuss how these process
groups are related to each other the
five process groups in project
management are initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing processes the image shows how
these process groups interact with each
other the initiating processes occur
only once during a project or phase
within a project at the beginning
whereas the closing processes occur only
once towards the end however planning
executing and monitoring and controlling
processes are repeated several times
during the project the planning
processes take information from the
initiating processes and help to prepare
an initial Baseline version of the plan
as the team starts execution they
understand the ground realities better
the deliverables produced and the data
of the progress are fed into the
monitoring and controlling process group
in the monitoring and controlling
process group the information generated
during execution is processed and
utilized in three different ways firstly
it can be used for revising the plan
which is termed as replanning secondly
it can be fed back into execution as
defects or corrective and preventive
actions or approved changes and thirdly
the information can result in the
cancellation of the project or the
successful completion of the project
upon validation of the deliverables
produced while discussing processes
consider it from the perspective of
project manager or as part of the
project management team this implies
that you are essentially functioning in
the integration management knowledge
area the initiating process includes two
steps which include getting the project
Charter approved and identifying
stakeholders click each tab to learn
more a project manager is concerned
about getting the charter for the
project approved project Charter sets
the beginning of the project where the
management has decided in its favor and
is ready to commit resources ources for
it the other process in the initiating
process group is identifying
stakeholders the project manager and the
project team should know the
stakeholders and their requirements
which is the starting point for planning
you may get concept-based questions in
the PMP exam so study the initiating
process to answer such questions easily
planning accounts for most of the
processes in the project management
framework as many as 24 out of the 47
project management processes belong to
the planning process group the basic
objective of the planning processes is
to produce the project management plan
collectively the developed project
management plan under integration
management assimilates the output of all
the planning processes under various
knowledge areas the project management
plan is the collection of all subsidiary
plans that address different aspects of
the project the project management team
integrates all these plans and ensures
that they are in harmony with one
another the team also prepares a
blueprint of how the project needs to be
executed controlled and closed the
planning process starts with scope
planning which is to understand exactly
what you are trying to achieve this is
translated into a project scope
statement which can be decomposed into a
work breakdown structure or WBS which
forms the basis of other planning
processes any change to the scope in
variably has a bearing on other
parameters that can affect the project
following the same logic it is easier to
understand how the planning processes in
other knowledge areas such as quality
cost and time can influence the time
that will be taken the cost that will be
incurred and the way quality will be
managed to satisfy the scope cost time
and quality equilibrium the project team
needs to manage Communications risk
stakeholders procurements and Human
Resources this is where the planning
processes under these knowledge areas
come in all these planning processes
interact with each other planning is an
interactive activity that gets
elaborated refined and adjusted as more
and more information about the project
is discovered planning without execution
is feudal but execution without planning
is fatal however in execution processes
the project team spends a lot of time
putting the plan into action when you
perform the executing processes you
often blend the execution and
controlling processes execution is all
about performing the plan that is
producing the deliverables and providing
information on the progress processing
of this information and the validation
of the deliverables is a Control
Function the executing process is the
direct and managed Project work where
the project manager essentially puts
certain mechanisms in place to ensure
that the work is being carried out the
project manager primarily focuses on
ensuring that the procurements are
conducted these procurements are
deliverables or services that the
project needs to buy from external
sources the project manager also needs
to ensure smooth flow of communication
within the project team and with the
external stakeholders the manager should
make sure that stakeholders are engaged
in the project and that the processes
for managing quality are being followed
correctly
it is important for the project manager
to make sure that the right team is
being used they have the knowledge and
competencies to do the job and they work
together as a team the project manager
should also manage the team to make sure
they are positioned for Success
monitoring is observing and getting data
about how things are going within the
project whereas controlling is taking
actions to bring things back on track
monitoring and controlling apply to
different aspects of project manag
management the image shows the various
areas of project management where
monitoring and control applies however
the knowledge area that has a
corresponding Control process is human
resources because Human Resources should
be managed not controlled an important
aspect of controlling is having an
elaborate mechanism to handle changes
closing processes bring a project or a
phase within the project to an orderly
conclusion only two knowledge areas
include a closing process these are
integration management and procurement
management closing a project or a phase
falls under integration management and
applies to the overall project before
the project is formally closed all the
procurements or contracts that are
entered into for the project must be
formally closed as well study the
closing processes in detail to answer
concept-based questions in the PMP exam
if you are looking to become a skilled
Pro project manager have a look at the
postgraduate program in project
management by simply learn there are 47
processes in project management grouped
into 10 knowledge areas and mapped to
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the first knowledge area
that is Project integration management
and its processes in the next screen let
us understand the concept of project
integration management
project integration management involves
unification consolidation articulation
and integrative actions that are crucial
for successfully completing the project
the project integration management is
highlevel work that project manager does
and it involves managing
interdependencies among the other
knowledge areas the other nine knowledge
areas involve detailed work in a
specific direction for example project
cost management Deals Only with how to
manage cost in a project the project
management processes do not happen
independently for example a new resource
added to the project may require changes
in cost or schedule or both in dealing
with such situations the project manager
integrates the processes of project
management the need for integration
drives much of the communication and the
work of the project manager let us
discuss the key role of project manager
sponsored and team in the next
screen project manager team members and
project sponsors have different roles to
play in a project the project manager is
supposed to play multiple roles in the
project the key role is to perform
integration the project manager puts all
the pieces of the project together into
a cohesive hole in doing so the project
manager tries to ensure that the project
is done faster cheaper and utilizes
resources optimally while meeting the
project objectives as the project
progresses the team members work on
completing the project activities the
role of the project sponsor is to
protect project from any unnecessary
changes and to ensure that it has the
required resources for completion the
project sponsor is the champion for the
project within the Performing
organization that is the organization in
which the work is being performed in the
next screen we will cover the project
selection
methods an organization can undertake a
project under contract with an external
organization or take up a project driven
by internal business needs there should
be a formal process of selecting project
in all organizations to ensure that it
is making the best possible use of
limited corporate
resources for examp example if the
organization has an option to take up
any one out of the two projects both of
which use the same corporate resources
the organization would naturally select
the one which is more profitable there
are two broad ways to select a project
one way is the benefit measurement
method where one project is compared
with other competing projects another
approach is based on mathematical models
wherein you examine the most optimal
selection of projects by trying to
optimize a goal for example maximize
operating profits such methods may be
called constrained optimization methods
there are different methods under both
these categories and you should be
familiar with the names of these methods
broadly the benefit measurement methods
focus on ascertaining the costs and
benefits of undertaking the project the
methods under benefit measurement method
include murder board where panel of
experts shoots down a new project idea
peerreview scoring models economic
models and benefit compared to cost the
constrained optimization methods rely on
mathematical modeling techniques to
determine the best selection of projects
to achieve certain business objectives
the methods of constrained optimization
method include linear programming in
reality you might not have seen these
methods to be followed in Project
selection often personal relationship
with the sponsor may be more important
than anything else this is quite normal
and any organization worldwide works
this way however as a certified project
manager it is important for you to be
familiar with more scientific methods of
project
selection a typical question on the capm
exam could be what type of project
selection technique is peer review and
the right answer is benefit measurement
method you need to understand the
characteristics of various project
selection methods to answer scenario
based
questions in the next screen we will
focus on the project selection
methods an organization has limited
resources they cannot execute all the
projects that come their way they can
take only those projects for execution
which are financially sound for the
organization there are various
parameters used in making such
decisions some of these terms are
present value Net Present Value internal
rate of return payback period benefit
cost ratio return on investment and
opportunity costs click each tab to
learn about the
parameters present value is today's
value of future cash flows in order to
reduce future cash flows to present
values a discount Factor has to be
applied what this essentially means is
if a project can give a return of say
$100 per year $200 next year and $250
the third year what is the value of all
these returns today $250 return in the
third year will not be the same as $250
today due to inflation or any other
constraint click close to go to the
process selection methods Das
board Net Present Value npv is the
present value of the total benefits
income or Revenue less the costs over a
Time therefore if multiple items are
involved add the present value of all of
them to arrive at the Net Present Value
problems where a project has to be
selected over other projects on the
basis of their Net Present Value can be
expected in the exam let us take an
example of a typical question that we
might encounter in the exam you have two
projects to choose from Project X will
take two years to complete and has an
npv of
$35,000 project y will take 5 years to
complete and has an npv of
$95,000 which one will you choose the
answer is Project y because it has a
higher npv do not get confused with
longer duration of the project it is it
is important that npv be more click
close to go to the process selection
methods
dashboard another term used in
evaluating a project is internal rate of
return or
irr irr is the rate of discounting at
which the present value of costs matches
the present value of benefits it is the
rate inherent in the project let us look
at an analogy to understand the concept
of
irr consider a project similar to
depositing money in a bank account and
earning interest you will prefer the
bank that gives maximum interest similar
is the project choose from Project A and
B where project a has an irr of
25% or Project B has an irr of
15% the answer is Project a as the irr
is better for project a it is OB
higher the irr the better click close to
go to the process selection methods
dashboard payback period is the number
of time periods it takes to recover your
investment in the project before you
start making profit on the investment
made in the project you have two
projects to choose from Project a with a
payback period of 5 months or Project B
with a payback period of 12 months which
which one would you go for the answer
would be project a it is evident that
lesser the payback period the better
click close to go to the process
selection methods
dashboard benefit cost ratio is the
ratio of the present value of benefits
to the present value of costs a benefit
cost ratio of more than one means that
benefits are greater than the
costs if the benefit cost ratio of
project a is 2.5 and benefit cost ratio
of Project B is 1.5 which project would
you select the answer is Project a as
the benefit cost ratio is higher in
Project a click close to go to the
process selection methods
dashboard return on investment or
Roi is commonly used in financial
parants to indicate how profitable a
project is return on investment is the
average rate of return or benefits
expected as compared to the initial
investment if a project involves an
initial investment of
$100,000 and generates an average return
of $20,000 per year it means the ROI is
20,000 by 100,000 or
20% higher the ROI the more profitable
the project is click close to go to the
process selection methods
dashboard opportunity cost is yet
another term used in evaluating
competing projects that you might see in
the exam it means the opportunity given
up by selecting one project over another
problems where a project has to be
selected over other projects on the
basis of their Net Present Value and
opportunity cost can be expected in the
exam for example you may come across a
question such as
what is the opportunity cost of
selecting Project B if project a has an
npv of
$55,000 and Project B has an npv of
$85,000 the answer is
$5,000 this is the npv of project a
which was selected over Project B click
close to go to the process selection
methods dashboard in the next screen let
us look at the
there are six project management
processes which are part of project
integration management knowledge area
they are the develop project Charter
done in the initiation process group
develop project management plan
undertaken in the planning process group
direct and manage work carried out in
the executing process group Monitor and
control project and perform integrated
Change Control undertaken in the
monitoring and controlling process group
and close project or phase done in the
closing process group let us look at
each of these processes in detail in the
next screen let us understand how to
read process related
information as you can see in the
project management process diagram these
elements within the knowledge area
represent the inputs from the same
knowledge area these elements represent
the inputs from other knowledge areas
these represent the tools and techniques
used in the process these are outputs of
the process these represent the output
within the same knowledge area whereas
these outputs are fed into the knowledge
areas other than the one that the
process is a part of you can observe
that the process in the image is
colorcoded based on the process group
initiating process group is in yellow
planning process group is in blue and so
on you can read the processes and their
color codes in the Legends box on the
bottom left of the screen the process
group affiliation is also indicated in
the text of the description it is
important to understand the process
group context to appreciate what the
process does in the next screen let us
look at the develop project Charter
process develop project Charter is is an
initiating process a project Charter is
essentially a document that authorizes a
project once a project has received a
charter it means that the project
manager can start employing the
organization's resources for the project
activities let us look at the key inputs
to be considered in preparing the
project Charter the first input is the
project statement of work this is
created by project sponsor or the
customer describing their needs project
scope and how the project fits into
their strategic goal if the project is
taken up under a contract the request
for proposal that is RFP can be
considered as project statement of work
the next input is the business case this
document establishes whether the
investment in a project is worth from a
business point of view the business need
for the project and the cost benefit
analysis it provides important
information to the project manager about
the goals of the project and the
boundaries in terms of the desired
results cost Etc if the project is being
undertaken as part of a contract or
agreement the agreement provides an
important input for the project manager
that establishes what must be done in
the project the next input to be
considered for project Charter is
interprise environmental factors any
project to be executed within the
organization
has to deal with the organization
culture and existing systems you can
consider this as an organization baggage
that comes with the project this is the
reason a project being executed in two
different organizations may be done
differently another factor to be
considered is organizational process
assets this is a broad term and includes
all the organizational processes
procedures and policies corporate
knowledge base and historical project
information every organization develops
a set of processes procedures and
policies that are based on the best
practices learned by the organization
over time the historical information
includes past project management plans
risks Lessons Learned Etc of similar
projects
executed now let us look at the tools
and techniques used in this process the
first technique is
expert
judgment expert judgment is an
invaluable input to the process of
formally authorizing a project because
an expert can provide insights into why
a project makes business sense or why it
does not from experience they may be
able to shed light about the validity of
the business drivers feasibility
assumptions and constraints that need to
be considered for the
project facilitation techniques is
another technique used the chartering
process is often a collaborative
activity involving many influential
stakeholders in an organization
facilitation techniques help bring all
these stakeholders together and engage
in fruitful discussions in order to
arrive at an informed decision whether
to go ahead with a project or
not the only output of this project is
the project Charter let us try to
understand what the project Charter
might contain the project Charter
usually contains the highlevel project
requirement and it should be created by
the project sponsor and hand it over to
the project manager the project manager
can do the groundwork to prepare the
project Charter but it must be signed by
the project sponsor or somebody in the
Performing organization who is higher in
Authority than the project manager it is
important to point out that a project
Charter is not a project management plan
the detailed risk schedule cost analysis
Etc is part of the project management
plan and should be done during the
project planning phase when there is
more detail on the availability of the
project to do so the charter should be
sufficiently high level to accommodate
the minor changes that might arise in
the project in the next screen let us
discuss the second process under project
integration management develop project
management plan
this is the process of documenting the
actions necessary to Define prepare
integrate and coordinate the subsidiary
plans examples of subsidiary plans are
project time management plan project
cost management plan project Human
Resource Management plan Etc the project
management plan does not just describe
when the project would start what
activity should be done and when the
project would get over it is a detailed
document and describes how the project
would be executed monitored and
controlled and closed many people think
that project schedule developed using
Microsoft Project is the project
management plan however that is not true
project management plan contains all the
subsidiary plans and their Baseline
value it also contains the allowed
variance in the Baseline value
performance measurement Baseline of
Project's time is the total of project
Baseline time and the agreed time
variance for the project for example the
time management plan section would have
mentioned the time taken by a project
the period mentioned in the project
management plan is 180 days this 180-day
period is also called the Baseline time
value therefore the Baseline value is
the initial agreed value in the project
management plan so if the time variance
agreed in the plan is 10% % the project
should be executed in maximum 180 + 180
multiplied by 10% is 180 + 18 which is
198
days whether the Baseline time value
should be 180 days or 300 days is
decided by analyzing the project
activities and it should not be decided
arbitrarily in the next screen let us
look at the various inputs outputs and
tools and techniques of this process
let us look at the inputs considered in
developing the project plan project
Charter from the previous process is an
important input the other inputs include
output of the other planning processes
because the project management plan is
supposed to integrate all of these plans
the examples of other plans are time
management Plan cost management plan and
quality management plan Etc
all of these plans are developed over a
period as the project progresses these
will be discussed in detail later in
this tutorial in addition to these
Enterprise environmental factors and
organization process assets are also
inputs to developing the project
management plan in fact these two
factors have more influence in
developing project management plan than
in developing project Charter it is
recommended that you understand these
inputs outputs and tools and techniques
clearly as most of these will be
repeated in other processes as well the
two tools and techniques employed in
this process are expert judgment and
facilitation techniques the very obvious
output of this process is the project
management plan in the next screen let
us look at some of the key terms which
are crucial in understanding these
processes
let us look at a few key terms to
understand project management processes
the first is the work authorization
system there should be a formal process
of authorizing work within the
project so be it internal team members
or project contractor there should be a
formal process of giving go-ahead to
start work on the project the next two
related terms are corrective and
preventive action
you will come across these terms
throughout this PMP
tutorial corrective action is any action
taken to bring expected future project
performance in line with the project
management plan for example if a project
Milestone is delayed as a corrective
action you include additional resources
to ensure that the final project
deadline is not delayed while corrective
action involves implementing actions to
deal with actual deviations from the
performance baselines preventive action
deals with anticipated or possible
deviation from performance baselines for
example to ensure that projects are not
delayed you do a proper estimation of
the work and assign enough resources to
the project so that they are not
delayed a very important system that
needs to be established early on in a
project is the Change Control System
since projects are executed in a dynamic
environment it is quite natural to
expect changes in the project
requirements the Change Control System
is the formal documented procedures
paperwork tracking systems for
authorizing changes therefore the Change
Control System analyzes each of the
incoming change requests and decides
whether to accept the change request or
reject it a configurable item is any
product service or result within the
project whose characteristics need to be
ID identified documented and placed
under Change Control mechanism examples
of configurable items are project
documents source code physical parts
such as tools recommended settings for
Machinery Etc when a formal
configuration management system is put
in place it is essentially establishing
a control system that can preserve the
characteristics of these
items now let us look at the next
process of the pro project integration
management knowledge area which is
direct and manage project
Work Direct and manage Project work is
the process of Performing the work
defined in the project management plan
to achieve the project objective this
process marks the performance and
completion of activities in a project
the input to this process is obviously
the project management plan since the
project is executed as per the project
management plan the other inputs to this
process are any approved change requests
that need to be implemented these could
be in the form of corrective or
preventive actions upon which the team
has decided to work the other two inputs
are Enterprise environmental factors and
organizational process assets let us
look at the tools and Techniques expert
judgment is an important tool used in
this process as well
another technique is the project
management information system or
pmis the pmis is a combination of
documents dashboards software tools Etc
where the data and information related
to the project gets collected as the
work is being done during execution it
is natural to expect that plenty of
meetings will take place among the team
members and among other stakeholders as
well there are several outputs from this
process project deliverables are
produced as the deliverables are being
produced there would also be data
related to the project performance that
will be generated such as what was done
how long did it take how much did it
actually cost Etc along with these key
outputs there are changes that new
change requests May emerge this could be
because during the execution phase the
team or the stakeholders May realize
that what is being produced is not
meeting the expectations or needs and
that something else may need to be done
in the process project documents and
project management plan get updated let
us look at Monitor and control project
work in the next
screen monitor and control project work
is the process of tracking reviewing and
regulating the progress to meet the
performance objective or objectives
defined in the project management
plan now the estimated time performance
measurement Baseline is 180 days and
10% the Monitor and control project work
is the process area that tracks whether
180 days and 10% Time Performance
Baseline is being met or not let us also
look at the key inputs for the Monitor
and control project work
process project management plan is the
key in input as the performance
measurement baselines are part of the
project management plan the other key
input to Monitor and control project
work is work performance information it
is the status of the project that is the
status of the project deliverables the
cost incurred the time elapsed in the
project Etc along with the work
performance information forecasts
related to the cost and time form
important inputs upon which the project
manager has to act validated changes
confirms that the approved changes have
been appropriately
Incorporated Enterprise environmental
factors and organization process assets
are also inputs to this process expert
judgment analytical techniques project
management information system and
meetings are the various tools and
techniques one of the outputs of this
process area is change request
change requests could be in the nature
of corrective and preventive actions or
defect repair if the performance
measurement baselines are not being met
this process ensures that project
manager takes appropriate corrective and
preventive action to get close to the
performance measurement baselines along
with the recommended corrective and
preventive action Monitor and control
project work also results in identifying
defects which must be taken care of
during the defect repair process many
reports related to the performance of
the work of the project will be
produced project management plan and
project documents are also updated in
the next screen let us focus on perform
integrated Change Control
process perform integrated Change
Control is the process of reviewing all
change requests approving and managing
change es to the project
deliverables organizational process
assets project documents and the project
management plan this is where all the
recommendations for changes corrective
actions preventive actions and defect
repairs are evaluated across all the
knowledge areas and either approved or
rejected the inputs to this process are
similar to that of the Monitor and
control project work
process project management plan work
performance reports Enterprise
environmental factors and organizational
process assets the only additional input
is the change requests since the perform
integrated Change Control process is
supposed to take care of managing the
incoming changes to make a judgment
about the change requests project
management plan and the work performance
reports are also referred to another
important tool and technique used in
this along with expert judgment and
meetings is Change Control tools and
most important among them is Change
Control Board the team takes up the
ownership of analyzing each of the
incoming changes and also does the
impact analysis for the changes and
finally approves or rejects a change the
project manager project sponsor and a
few of the important stakeholders and
team members may be part of the Change
Control Board the process should produce
change requests that are approved a log
of change requests processed requests
that were either approved or rejected
and a few updates to the project plan
and other documents change management
and change control is the theme
recurring in many questions in the
examination you can expect questions in
the exam which test a project manager's
response to a particular change in the
project in the next screen let us take a
closer look at functioning of this
process now let us look at the process
of change first the project manager
should determine that a change has
either already occurred or if the change
is necessary one of the important
qualities of a good project manager is
that they will push back on unnecessary
changes the next step is to evaluate its
impact on the project in totality the
team needs to understand what would be
the impact on the time cost quality risk
resource requirements and so on once the
impact is known the project manager
along with the team should look for
various possible options to accommodate
the change for instance in order to
accommodate an increase in scope it may
be necessary to extend timeline add
resources increase budget or a
combination of the above once the impact
analysis and exploration of possible
options are completed the project
manager should present it to internal as
well as external stakeholders for their
approval it should be presented to
internal stakeholders first because the
management of an organization may decide
to absorb the change within the
Project's reserves without opting to
build the
customer if the project will have an
impact on the agreed baselines of time
cost scope and quality one needs to get
in touch with the external stakeholders
and the customer these steps are an
important aspect of a project manager's
job and the ability of a project manager
to manage change will be tested in the
capm examination in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer close project or phase is the
last process of the project management
integration knowledge area this process
ensures that the project or a phase is
formally closed after completion
remember that PMI expects a mature
organization and a trained project
manager to be diligent in following
closure
formalities without going through the
formal closure formalities the project
cannot abruptly be closed the project
should be formally closed even if it is
terminated due to some problem the key
input to this process is the accepted
deliverables the deliverables have to be
brought into a state that they can be
properly transitioned transition means
they are handed over to the organization
or group that will be responsible for
operations maintenance and support the
other inputs are project management plan
and organizational process assets expert
judgment analytical techniques and
meetings are the commonly used tools and
techniques the closure of a project or a
phase results in a product service or a
transition in the process one of the
important outputs is updates to the
organizational process assets these
include the actual performance against
the plan the key lessons learned during
the project the risks identified the
updates to the skills and experience of
the team members Etc updating these
these assets is mandatory as it helps
the organization gain maturity and learn
from the
experience in the next screen let us
look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson project
integration management involves
unification consolidation articulation
and integrative actions that are crucial
for successfully completing the project
integrating the project activities is
the key role of a project manager the
project team focuses on completing the
project activities and the project
sponsor warrants the team against
unsolicited
changes benefit measurement methods
ascertain the costs and benefits of
undertaking the project while
constrained optimism methods rely on
mathematical modeling to select the best
projects that achieve business
objectives various project integration
management processes art develop project
Charter develop project management plan
direct and manage work Monitor and
control project perform integrated
change control and close project or
phase hello and welcome to capm
certification course offered by simply
learn in this lesson we will focus on
Project scope management let us begin
with the objectives of this
lesson after completing this lesson you
will be able to Define project scope
management differentiate between project
scope and product scope identify the key
terms used in Project scope management
explain work breakdown structure
describe the project scope management
processes in the next screen let us take
a look at project management process
map there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
second knowledge area that is Project
scope management and its processes let
us begin with the first topic of this
lesson that is Project scope management
project scope management includes the
processes required to ensure that a
project comprises all and only the work
required to complete the project
successfully the project scope
management is concerned about the scope
what is not there in the scope is also
clearly identified in the next screen
let us look at the Key activities
performed under project scope
management let us look at a few of the
typical activities that happen as part
of the project scope management constant
monitoring is essential to make sure
that all the project work is being
completed the gradual uncontrolled
increase in scope of the project is
referred as scope creep it is necessary
to define the project scope boundaries
and not let people randomly add to the
project scope gold plating is doing more
than what is required as part of the
project scope this has to be avoided in
projects as per the published statistics
about projects done globally less than
40% of projects can be considered
successful therefore the focus should be
on what is required rather than
squandering around with what is not
required 40% might be considered less
but a project is classified as
successful only if it meets all its
objectives and is done within time and
cost
budgets in the next screen let us
understand the differences between
product scope and project
scope project scope management deals
with managing both the product scope as
well as the project scope product scope
refers to the features and functions
that characterize a product service or
result the word product may also include
creation of a service for example in the
banking industry each of their services
is called a
product likewise a savings account is
one of their products mutual fund is
another on the other hand project scope
is the work that needs to be
accomplished to deliver the output of
the project which could be a product
service or result with the specific
features and
functions for instance to deliver a
product you may also need to produce a
requirements document or a design
document these are not part of the
product scope but it may very well be
part of the project scope in the next
screen let us discuss a few key terms
used in the project scope
management WBS stands for work breakdown
structure it means breaking the project
deliverables into smaller and more
manageable components called work
packages the last level of work in such
subdivision is called work packages and
the whole structure is called WBS
for example a typical software
development project would have various
activities like finalizing requirements
designing the new system coding testing
and going live with the new system each
of these translates into highlevel
deliverables which can be further
subdivided into smaller activities which
are more
predictable WBS dictionary like any
dictionary contains the explanation of
the terms used in WBS
a typical WBS dictionary has details
like the control account name of the
work package description of the work
package resource assigned if there are
any assumptions or dependencies to
complete the work package the due date
to finish the work package Technical
dependencies and so on WBS dictionary is
useful for the person or group working
on the work packages as it further
elaborates the decomposed work package
control account is a level within WBS at
which management wishes to exercise
control for example perform earned value
analysis Track Performance Etc in the
next screen let us cover work breakdown
structure in
detail along with the scope statement
and the WBS dictionary the work
breakdown structure forms the scope
Baseline of the project that is it
should reflect the entire scope of the
project any deliverables that are not
reflected in WBS are not part of the
project the creation of the WBS should
involve the whole team the creation of
WBS creates common understanding about
the scope and therefore leads to team
buyin during decomposing the
deliverables you must ensure that each
level is complete that is it includes
all the work in the project before you
start to decompose further decomposition
continues until the lowest level
deliverable cannot be logically
subdivided further or they can be
estimated with reasonable accuracy WBS
is a deliverable oriented decomposition
it should only contain deliverables and
not activities while developing the
schedule converting the deliverables
into activities is one of the problems
as WBS does not contain activity level
details concept-based questions on work
breakdown structure can be expected in
the exam so it is essential to have a
clear understanding of the concept of
WBS in the next screen let us look into
an example which shows how WBS is
derived work breakdown structure of a
core banking software development
project is given on the screen the scope
of the project has been divided into WBS
elements like requirements documentation
design and architecture Code test and go
live further these elements are
decomposed into work package level to
make it easier to manage the
deliverables in terms of scope cost and
time it also helps to estimate or assign
the specific work packages to team
members or groups the design and
architecture has been decomposed to
model and prototype similarly code is
decomposed into work package 3.1 and 3.2
test into work package 4.1 and 4.2 and
go live into product installer and
warranty sheet WP 3.1 can be represented
as model one and WP 3.2 as model 2
similarly WP 4.1 may be test strategy
document and WP 4.2 a test plan document
the number here indicates work breakdown
code
in the next screen let us discuss how
project scope management is actually
accomplished there are six project
management processes which are part of
project scope management knowledge area
these processes are plan scope
management collect requirements Define
scope create WBS validate scope and
control scope the first four processes
that is plan scope management collect
requirements Define scope and create WBS
are part of the planning process group
and the remaining two processes validate
scope and control scope are executed as
part of the monitoring and controlling
process group in the next few screens we
will look at each of these processes in
detail let's begin with PL scope
management plan scope management process
creates a scope management plan that
documents how the project scope will be
defined validated and controlled it is
usually the starting point of the
planning processes on a project
understanding the scope and how it will
be managed is fundamental to planning
the other aspects of the project let us
review the list of inputs to this
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and will
help guide the scope plan planning
activities on the project the project
Charter provides an overall context and
the highlevel product and project
description which may help determining
the approach for the scope
management Enterprise environmental
factors provide the organizational
context to the project including the
culture of the organization the
infrastructure key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as polic icies and
procedures historical information and
knowledge base now let us look at the
tools and techniques imployed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources meetings may be
organized to determine the scope
management plan everyone responsible for
the project scope management such as the
project manager sponsor customer and
other stakeholders must attend attend
these meetings now let us look at the
outputs of this
process the scope management plan
describes how the project scope will be
defined like who will be involved in the
process whose inputs will be sought what
techniques may be used to get these
inputs Etc developed that is in what
form will the scope be elaborated and
documented monitored and controlled and
verified the plan may also describe how
WBS will be created from the scope
statement how changes to the scope will
be managed how deliverables will receive
formal acceptance
Etc the requirements management plan is
a subsidiary of the project management
plan that describes how requirements
will be analyzed documented and managed
a requirement is voiced by a customer or
a stakeholder whereas scope represents
what the project team will do or deliver
in order to meet that need
the requirement management plan may also
describe how the configuration
management of requirements will be
carried out how they will be prioritized
how the metrics will be used to
rationalize these choices and how the
traceability of the requirements will be
maintained throughout the project you
may got questions in the capm exam based
on the inputs tools and techniques and
outputs of plan scope management so
understanding of these topics will help
you to to answer concept-based questions
correctly in the next screen let us look
at the second process collect
requirements collect requirements is the
second of the six project scope
management processes it is the process
of defining and documenting stakeholders
needs to meet the project objectives let
us look at the inputs to this process
scope management and the requirements
management plan provide Clarity on how
the team should go about collecting and
documenting the requirements for the
project the stakeholder management plan
provides insights into the stakeholders
communication requirements and the level
of stakeholder engagement needed the
stakeholder register May provide useful
guidance about which of the stakeholders
could provide the requirements for the
project it is very important that all
the stakeholders expectations are
captured adequately and represented in
the requirements do
the project Charter provides highlevel
requirements and expectations and may be
used to detail out the
requirements now let us look at the
tools and techniques that can be
employed to collect the
requirements it is important for the
project team to use a combination of
techniques that will give them maximum
clarity about the requirements some of
the techniques may include direct
interaction like interviewing forming
focus groups conducting workshops and
using group creativity techniques like
brainstorming and group decisionmaking
techniques it may also include some
offline activities like conducting
surveys via questionnaires
Etc observation can be a very powerful
way to capture requirements that may be
difficult to state or
articulate prototyping is a powerful
technique where the team comes up with a
model or sample artifact that helps the
users visualize and gain more clarity
about what is being developed
benchmarking is useful for understanding
and learning from the industry and
organizational benchmarks about the bare
minimum
expectations use of context diagrams and
analyzing the documentation provided can
also help in collecting
requirements requirements documentation
is one of the most important output the
second output of this process is
requirements traceability Matrix this
table helps Trace whether the work has
happened on the requirements whether all
requirements are reflected in the final
product of the project Etc in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible
answer plan scope management process
creates a scope management plan that
documents how the project scope will be
defined validated and controlled it is
usually the starting point of the
planning processes on a project
understanding the scope and how it will
be managed is fundamental to planning
the other aspects of the project let us
review the list of inputs to this
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and will
help guide the scope planning activities
on the project the project Charter
provides an overall context and the
highlevel product and project
description which may help determining
the approach for the scope
management Enterprise environmental
factors provide the organizational
context to the project including the
culture of the organization the
infrastructure key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
historical information and knowledge
base now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources meetings may be
organized to determine the scope
management plan everyone responsible for
the project scope management such as the
project manager sponsor customer and
other stakeholders must attend these
meetings now let us look at the outputs
of this
process the scope management plan
describes how the Project's scope will
be defined like who will be involved in
the process whose inputs will be sought
what techniques may be used to get these
inputs Etc developed that is in what
form will the scope be elaborated and
documented monitored and controlled and
verified the plan may also describe how
WBS will be created from the scope
statement how changes to the scope will
be managed how deliverables will receive
formal acceptance
Etc the requirements management plan is
a subsidiary of the project management
plan that describes how requirements
will be analyzed documented and managed
a requirement is voiced by a customer or
a stakeholder whereas scope represents
what the project team will do or deliver
in order to meet that need the
requirement management plan may also
describe Des cribe how the configuration
management of requirements will be
carried out how they will be prioritized
how the metrics will be used to
rationalize these choices and how the
traceability of the requirements will be
maintained throughout the project you
may got questions in the capm exam based
on the inputs tools and techniques and
outputs of plan scope management so
understanding of these topics will help
you to answer concept-based questions
correctly in the next screen let us look
at the second process collect
requirements given on the screen is an
example of the requirements traceability
Matrix it lists all the requirements
recorded in the requirements
documentation in the first column in the
subsequent columns it traces how the
requirement is being met by specific
sections or objects in the subsequent
stages in case of a software development
project the requirement about enabling
multi-user access may require changes in
multiple places these are specifically
called out in the columns titled design
coding testing Etc this ensures each
requirement is specifically addressed
through all the stages of the life cycle
and also provides a backwards
traceability by clarifying why a
particular change is made at each stage
that is which requirement is driving
these changes
a typical question in the capm exam can
be one related to the creation of WBS so
understanding the requirements
traceability Matrix will help you to
answer concept-based questions in the
next screen let us look at the third
project scope management process Define
scope given on the screen is an example
of the requirements traceability
Matrix it lists all the requirements
required reced in the requirements
documentation in the first column in the
subsequent columns it traces how the
requirement is being met by specific
sections or objects in the subsequent
stages in case of a software development
project the requirement about enabling
multi-user access may require changes in
multiple places these are specifically
called out in the columns titled design
coding testing Etc this ensures each
requirement is specifically addressed
through all the stages of the life cycle
and also provides a backwards
traceability by clarifying why a
particular change is made at each stage
that is which requirement is driving
these changes a typical question in the
capm exam can be one related to the
creation of WBS so understanding the
requirements traceability Matrix will
help you to answer concept-based
questions in the next screen let us look
at the third project scope management
process Define
scope the next process in the project
scope management is Define scope defined
scope is the process of developing a
detailed description of the project and
product collect requirements lists for
all the different requirements or needs
expressed by the stakeholders defined
scope deals with the detailing these
requirements and determining what will
be be in the scope of the project and
what will not be it belongs to the
planning process group let us look at
the inputs to this process the scope
management plan provides the details
about the process of capturing and
documenting the scope of the project
project Charter which describes the
business need of the project and
requirements documentation developed as
part of the collect requirement process
also form inputs to this process
organizational process assets are also a
part of the defined scope process
organization templates may be used to
write the project scope or refer to the
lessons learned from previous similar
projects for projects which have product
instead of a service as an output
product analysis is a commonly used
technique this defines what is required
in a Project's product Alternatives
generation is a technique used to see if
the project requirements can be
completed in a different way similar to
lateral thinking expert judgment is a
technique using an expert may be an
external consultant to look at various
requirements and come up with the
project scope statement in order to
define the scope you may also conduct
specific workshops that are facilitated
to generate ideas around the project
scope the output of this process is the
project project scope statement which
describes in detail the projects
deliverables and the work required to
create those deliverables therefore the
project scope statement has Project's
product scope description product
acceptance criteria project deliverables
and project
constraints this process also results in
updating the requirements documentation
and requirement traceability Matrix
developed earlier let us look at the
next process create
WBS the final planning process within
scope management is create
WBS create WBS is the process of
subdividing project deliverables and
project work into smaller more
manageable components it belongs to the
planning process group The WBS is
created with project scope statement and
the requirements document as input the
scope management plan provides the
details about the process of capturing
and documenting the scope of the project
and how the deliverables should be
decomposed in the form of a WBS and how
it should be maintained the templates
and standards related to the industry
and The Specific Enterprise may be
useful in creating
WBS if there is an organization's
template for writing down WBS that is
also used
the other two inputs are organizational
process assets and Enterprise
environmental factors decomposition is
an important technique used in this
process in decomposition the project
deliverables are subdivided into smaller
more manageable components until the
work and deliverables are defined at the
work package level the work package
level is the lowest level in the WBS and
is the point at which the cost and
activity duration of the work can be
reliably estimated and managed the level
of detail for work packages vary as per
the size and complexity of the project
another technique used is expert
judgment the output of this process is
scope
Baseline the project scope statement WBS
and WBS dictionary are collectively
referred to as scope Baseline scope
Baseline is part of project management
plan
this process also results in Project
document updates implementing WBS may
result in getting more clarity about the
requirements itself the requirement
document or the project scope statement
developed earlier should be updated in
the next screen let us look at the
validate scope
process validate scope is the process of
formalizing acceptance of the completed
project deliverables
validating scope includes reviewing
deliverables with a customer or sponsor
to ensure they are completed
satisfactorily and obtained formal
acceptance validate scope is closely
related to quality control as well
however scope validation is primarily
concerned with acceptance of the
deliverables whereas quality control is
primarily concerned with correctness of
the deliverables and meeting the quality
requirements specified for the
deliverables quality control is
generally performed before scope
validation but these two processes can
be performed in parallel as well let us
look at the inputs to this process the
project management plan provides
information about how the deliverables
will be validated and accepted by the
customer and other stakeholders the
requirements documentation acts as the
basis on which the validation activity
is to be carried out the requirements
traceability Matrix documents how each
of the requirements has been implemented
and how it can be validated the fourth
input is verified deliverables and
implies that the verification activity
is first carried out by the team under
the control quality process and only
then the deliverable enters the
validation process work performance data
gives more inputs on the deliverables
that may be useful in validating and
getting acceptance
the technique used to validate scope is
inspection and group decision-making
some of the typical activities that are
done as part of inspection are measuring
examining and validating to determine
whether the work and deliverables meet
requirements and product acceptance
criteria group decision-making
techniques may be employed if a team is
working on the process of validating the
deliverables it helps in arriving at a
decision by either consensus or majority
or any other method the output of this
process is the accepted
deliverable sometimes deliverable might
be acceptable and that results in
another output that is change request
due to the validation process the
information about the deliverables which
have been accepted and any observations
during the validation process may be
recorded some documents like report on
status of the Project's product is up
dated as a result of this process and
listed as one of the outputs in the next
screen let us look at the control scope
process control scope is the process of
monitoring the status of the project and
product scope and changes to the scope
Baseline controlling the project scope
ensures all requested changes and
recommended corrective or preventive
actions are processed through the same
perform integrated Change Control
process the inputs project management
plan requirements documentation and work
performance data are the same as the
inputs for control scope and validate
scope work performance data has
information about progress of work on
the different
deliverables the other input is
requirements traceability Matrix which
lists the requirements included in the
requirements document organization proc
process assets also influence control
scope in a sense where an organization
would have standard templates for
monitoring and Reporting scope related
updates scope control is performed using
variance analysis the variation is
measured from the original scope
Baseline which decides whether any
corrective or preventive action is
required the key output of the control
scope is work performance information
which is planned versus actual technical
scope performance if any part of the
scope performance does not meet the
acceptance criteria it may result in
change requests which is the other major
output of this
process all of these may result in
updates to the project plan as well as
other project and organizational process
documents business scenario based
questions on scope control can be
expected in the capm exam so
understanding the concept of scope
control is essential in the next screen
let us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better if you
are looking to become a skilled project
manager have a look at the postgraduate
program in project management by simply
learn there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the third
knowledge area that is Project time
manag management and its processes let
us begin with the first topic of this
lesson project time
management the purpose of project time
management is to ensure that the
projects get completed on time this
knowledge area is primarily concerned
with developing a project schedule and
ensuring that project goes as per the
agreed schedule if there is a need to
change the project schedule the change
should happen by following a proper
change control procedure another term
used in the PM examination is schedule
management plan schedule management plan
is part of the project management plan
and has information on the planned
project schedule and its management and
control let us discuss the Key
activities of project time management in
the next
screen the Key activities that are part
of the project time management include
identifying activities estimating time
and resources and sequencing activities
it is important to identify a list of
activities that would be a part of the
project next an estimation of time and
resources required for completing the
identified activities are done finally
these activities need to be sequenced as
per the dependencies in the next screen
let us discuss project
schedule project schedule represents the
time dimension of the project project
plan and has information like when the
project would start when each of the
project activities would happen in what
order the project activities would
happen when project would be completed
Etc usually Software System is used to
develop the project schedule the project
team can enter the list of activities in
the software as well as their
dependencies and the software can
produce the project schedule as the
output Microsoft project is the most
popular tool used for project schedule
development generally project schedule
is considered similar to project
management plan project management plan
is different from Project schedule
project management plan not only has
information about the project schedule
but also other important project related
plans like Risk Management Plan cost
management plan Etc let us focus on Gant
chart in the next screen
Gant chart is a type of bar chart that
illustrates a project schedule it shows
the dependencies between the project
activities as well as their percent
completion a sample Gant chart is shown
on the screen two summary elements of
the work breakdown structure are
depicted to complete those elements
there are a number of activities under
them some of these activities have
dependencies for example activity B and
C have a dependency activity C can start
only when activity B is completed the
chart gives you an idea about when
specific activities are planned to
finish and when the overall WBS element
will get delivered create tasks and work
with the Gant chart this will make
answering Gant chart-based questions
easy and fun in the next screen let us
understand the relationships that exist
among project
activities Network d diagram is
extensively used in the project time
management knowledge area to plot the
activity
dependencies this is a graphical
representation of the project activities
in the form of a network there are two
ways to draw a network
diagram in precedence diagramming model
PDM or activity on node AO n boxes
represent activities and the arrows
indicate the dependency this type of of
network can have all four types of
relationships between the
activities in arody diagramming model
ADM or activity on Arrow AOA the arrows
represent activities the relationships
and sequences can be inferred from the
direction of the arrows and linkages
between the activities in such types of
network only finish to start
relationships can be
shown such diagrams may need to make use
of dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the network diagram so create and
work with the diagram this will make
answering Network diagram based
questions easy and fun in the next
screen let us look at a network
diagram a sample Network diagram is
shown on the screen activities A and C
can happen in parallel B and D require
both A and C to complete whereas e
requires both B and D to complete
activity on Arrow Network diagram makes
use of hammock activities they are used
to show a comprehensive summary activity
combining several other activities
underneath for control and Reporting
purposes in the next screen let us look
at a few important terms in time
management when a successor activity can
start before the predecessor activity
can complete
it is considered lead for example you
can start preparing the test environment
2 weeks before the development activity
finishes when the successor activity has
to wait for a few days after the
predecessor activity has been completed
it is considered lag for example one
needs to wait for 2 days for the
foundation to settle before work on the
pillars for the next floor starts
rolling wave planning is an iterative
planning technique in which the work to
be accomplished in the near-term is
planned in detail while the work in the
future is planned at a higher level it
is a form of progressive
elaboration in the context of estimating
techniques analogous estimating is based
on the previous project data therefore
if the last five similar projects took
six months to complete the next one will
also take six months this technique
employs expert judgment another
estimating technique is parametric
estimating this technique uses a
mathematical model to calculate
projected time for an activity based on
the historical records from previous
projects and other
information a few common parameters are
identified based on the previous project
data and that parameter is used to
predict the time required to complete
the next activity or project for example
you can normally complete 10 km of
Highway construction Lanes a week effort
is the total amount of work required to
complete the activity duration is the
amount of time it takes in terms of a
lab store calendar days if you have an
activity that requires 10 people to work
for 5 days the total effort is 50 person
days but the duration is only 5 days in
the next screen let us look at the
project time management
processes there are seven project time
manag AG M processes they are plan
schedule management define activities
sequence activities estimate activity
resources estimate activity durations
develop schedule and control schedule
the first six processes are executed
during the planning process group the
ultimate goal of these planning
processes is to develop the project
schedule the seventh and the last
process is a part of the monitor in and
controlling process
group in the next few screens let us
discuss these processes in detail we
will begin with plan schedule
management as defined in pimbo guide
plan schedule management is the process
of establishing the policies procedures
and documentation for planning
developing managing executing and
controlling the project schedule it
belongs to the planning process group
let us look at the in puts to this
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and will
guide the schedule planning activities
on the project the project Charter
provides an overall context and the
highlevel product and project
description which might help determine
the approach for schedule management few
projects might have scheduling
constraint for example projects of
Olympics 2016 should be completed at the
same time
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization the infrastructure like
scheduling systems available key
personnel and so on organizational
process assets provide inputs such as
policies and procedures templates past
performance data and estimates
historical information and knowledge
base now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced
resources experts can draw from their
previous experiences the proper approach
to govern the schedule on a project
meetings may be organized to determine
the schedule management plan anybody
responsible for the project schedule
management such as the project manager
sponsor customer and other stakeholders
must attend these
meetings several analytical techniques
may be used to determine the schedule
management plan these may include
different planning approaches and
philosophies such as rolling wave
planning or different scheduling
software that allow to build what if
scenarios and study the effect of
advanced scheduling techniques like
leveling fast tracking and crashing now
let us look at the outputs of this
process schedule management plan is a
component of the project management plan
that describes the criteria and
activities required to arrive at the
project schedule as well as how the
project may be baselined monitored and
controlled in the next screen let us
define activities
process define activities is the process
of identifying the specific actions to
be performed to produce the project
deliverables it belongs to the planning
process group the important input for
the defin activities process is the
scope Baseline scope Baseline is a term
used collectively to refer to project
deliverables constraints and assumptions
of the project in addition to the scope
Baseline the other inputs in this
process are Enterprise environmental
factors organizational process assets
and schedule management plan a reason
why Enterprise environmental factors is
an input to define activities is because
the organization might be using project
management software to define activities
and that may influence the activity
definition process the knowledge base
containing historical information
regarding activities lists used by
previous similar projects is a good
example of organization process assets
applied to
scheduling the tools and techniques used
in defining activities are decomposition
and rolling wave planning the last
technique is expert judgment where the
experience of project team members is
used in developing detailed activity
lists the output of the process is
activity list activity attributes and
Milestone list activity list contains a
list of identified activities activ
attributes are the additional
information about the activity itself a
milestone is a significant point or
event in the project a milestone list
identifies all the milestones and
indicates whether the Milestone is
mandatory or optional let us move on to
the next process sequence
activities sequence activities is the
process of identifying and documenting
relationships among the project
activities and is also part of the
planning process group for every
activity and Milestone except the first
and last one is connected to or at least
one predecessor and one successor the
inputs to this process are activity list
activity attributes and Milestone list
all these are the outputs of the defined
activity process the other inputs are
schedule management plan and project
scope statement
schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project organization
process assets are also an input to
sequencing activities because the
organization might have some kind of
knowledge base for scheduling project
activities the Enterprise environmental
factors relevant to this process may be
scheduling Tools in use project
management information systems work
authorization systems Etc one of the
important tools and techniques used in
sequencing activities is the Precedence
diagramming method in this method the
activities are drawn on a network
diagram and all the different kinds of
dependencies between the activities are
determined while determining activity
dependency it is important to identify
the type of relationship or dependency
between the activities the the other
technique is leads and lag which is
widely used for sequencing activities
the output of the process is the project
schedule Network diagram which is a
graphical representation of the project
activities in a form of network which
also shows the activity
dependencies while designing the network
diagram new activities might be
identified and that would result in some
of the project document updates
especially the ones that list all the
project activities in the next screen
let us look at the estimate activity
resources
process after sequencing the activities
the next step in Project time management
is estimating the resources required to
accomplish each of the identified
activities estimate activity resources
process also belongs to the planning
process group here resources do not mean
only the human resources but include all
other resources like equipment raw
materials Machinery
Etc schedule management plan is the
first input schedule management plan
provides guidance in terms of
methodology to be employed for many of
the scheduling activities on the project
the other inputs to this process are an
activity list and activity attributes
that are the outputs of the time
management
processes risk register is another input
risks to the project project May
influence the decisions about the
resources that need to be deployed hence
risk register becomes an input to this
project in addition activity cost
estimates are another input cost and
resource estimates on a project are
interrelated and influence each other
for example the cost might dictate the
number and type of resources that can be
employed or the time might dictate the
cost that may need to be incurred
along with this the resource calendar is
also an important input because it has
the information about the availability
of each of the
resources some of the Enterprise
environmental factors that can influence
estimating activity resources are
availability of required resources
within the
organization the organizational process
assets is also an important input as the
organization might have standard
policies for Staffing or for hiring
contractors on the project with all
these inputs available for estimating
activity resources there are various
techniques used for estimating the
required resources the first technique
is using expert
judgment in this technique an expert in
resource planning and estimating can
estimate each of the activities the next
technique used is alternative analysis
in this the activities are analyzed to
identify different ways of completing
them this is to ensure only the required
resources are assigned to each of the
activities this helps in resource
optimization along with the two
techniques many organizations routinely
publish their estimating data and this
could be used in activity resource
estimation another technique that is
routinely used in activity estimation is
bottomup estimating which is decomposing
the activity further down to understand
it in more detail and estimating at that
level later all such estimates are added
to arrive at the estimate of the
activity in real projects one has to use
all the estimate each of the activities
sometimes the project management
software also helps in estimating the
software estimates are based on the
inputs provided to It software should
only be considered as a supporting tool
in estimation and never fully rely on
its output clearly the output of this
process is the activity resource
requirements along with this resource
breakdown structure is also prepared the
resource breakdown structure is the
categorization of all the required
resources in various categories that is
human resources equipment raw materials
Etc in the process of estimation several
other project documents may also be
updated for example the resource
estimates are directly correlated with
cost estimates let us now move on to the
next process estimate activity
durations the next process is to
estimate the duration required to
complete each of the activities the
duration estimation should be done by
someone who is familiar with the project
for example the same activity if done by
a high skilled resource would take less
time compared to a less skilled
resource this may vary regardless of the
resource used due to the project
requirements in addition the activity
duration estimation should be updated
continuously as you move ahead with the
project because as the project
progresses there will be more clarity on
the project the inputs of this process
are similar to the ones in sequence
activities process schedule management
plan is the first input schedule
management plan provides guidance in
terms of methodology to be employed for
many of the scheduling activities on the
project for instance it may contain
information about the estimation
techniques to be employed and the people
who need to be involved in the
estimation
process activity resource requirements
is also an input to this process because
resources assigned to an activity would
significantly affect the activity
duration that is the lower skilled
resources would take more time than the
high skilled resources the other inputs
include activity list activity
attributes and resource breakdown
structure resource calendars are also an
input to this process the type and skill
set of resources available to the team
may have an impact on the time it would
take to complete the
activities risks to the project May
influence the decisions about the time
required to complete the activity
hence risk register becomes an input to
this
process the project scope statement
defines the constraints and assumptions
affecting the project duration an
example of Enterprise environmental
factor that can affect duration is
organization's productivity metrics
which is collected based on the
experiences from multiple projects the
last input in this process is
organizational process Assets Now let us
look at the tools and techniques used
for estimating activity durations first
is the expert judgment which means using
previous project experiences in
estimating the current project duration
this can be used with other estimation
techniques and used to reconcile
differences if different techniques
result in different
estimates three-point estimating is a
method where three estimates are used
instead of one it is part of a project
management philos philosophy known as
program evaluation and review technique
per estimating activity durations is
often done as a team exercise as each
activity may require multiple skill sets
to be applied therefore it is important
to use group decisionmaking techniques
to arrive at a consensus or at least an
estimate that is acceptable to all the
team
members Reserve analysis adds buffer
into the project schedule to deal with
any uncertainty the contingency reserve
may be added as a percentage of the
activity duration or fixed number of
work periods the other tools and
techniques are analogous estimating and
parametric
estimating the outputs of this process
are the activity duration estimates and
project documents updates the activity
duration estimates is represented in
terms of the range of possible results
for example 10 days plus minus 2 days
that is the activity would take minimum
8 days and maximum 12 days in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer develop
schedule is the process of analyzing
activity sequences durations resource
requirements and schedule constraints to
create the project schedule it belongs
to the planning process group generally
scheduling software is used for
developing the project schedule entering
the activities durations and resources
into a scheduling tool generates a
schedule with planned dates for
completing project
activities developing a project schedule
is an iterative process revising and
maintaining a realistic schedule is a
task in itself and it continues
throughout the project as the work
progresses the most of the inputs of
this process are the outputs of estimate
activity durations process they are risk
register project scope statement project
staff assignments resources calendars
organizational process assets Enterprise
environmental factors schedule
management plan activity list activity
attributes project schedule Network
diagrams activity resource requirements
resource breakdown structure and
activity duration estimates various
tools and techniques are used to develop
schedule process schedule network
analysis is a technique that generates
project schedule it employs various
analytical techniques such as critical
path method critical chain method
modeling techniques and resource
optimization techniques to create the
project schedule
the other tools and techniques include
leads and lags schedule compression and
scheduling tool let us now look at the
outputs of this process the project
schedule consists of a minimum plan
start date and planned finish date for
each activity although project schedule
can be represented in tabular format it
is more often represented graphically
using either bar charts or network
diagrams or a combination of the two
the final schedule which is the output
of the developed schedule process is
also called schedule Baseline once the
schedule is baselined it can be changed
only through formal approvals meeting
the schedule Baseline is one of the
measures of project
success scheduled data produced may
include number of resources key
Milestones
Etc project calendars specify the
available working days and the number of
shifts in each day
it indicates how many hours and days are
available for the work of the project to
be
completed project management plan
updates are a result of the developed
schedule process many of the other
subsidiary plans of the project plan may
get impacted which may include cost
management plan scope management plan
risk management plan Etc this may also
result in other project documents being
updated in the next few screens let us
discuss schedule network analysis
techniques it is essential to know if
the required resources are available at
that time along with the time estimate
of each of the activities since schedule
is calendar-based it helps in estimating
the same schedule network analysis
technique generates project schedule
there are various schedule Network
techniques critical path method relies
on determining the critical path on a
project sched schedule critical chain
method is a variant of the critical path
method wherein the critical chain is
determined based on The Logical resource
and other kinds of dependencies between
the
activities what if scenario analysis is
about trying to vary a certain parameter
to observe the impact on the schedule
for instance you may want to check
result if you put in more resources on a
particular activity to reduce its
duration resource optimization
techniques try to arrive at the optimal
utilization of the resources used on a
project ideally you would want the
resources to be fully utilized but you
would also want to build in sufficient
buffers in case a certain resource is
not available due to various reasons in
the next screen let us look at the
program evaluation and review
technique program evaluation and review
technique is based on three-point
estimates for an activity the
pessimistic estimate refers to the worst
case scenario whereas most likely
estimate is what you expect to happen in
a realistic
scenario the optimistic estimate on the
other hand represents the amount of time
and activity would take in the best case
scenario based on these three estimates
the expected duration of the estimate is
calculated as per the formula given on
the screen the formula for calculating
standard deviation of an activity and
variance of an activity is also given
there is no question asked on variance
but the formula is important because if
the standard deviation of the whole
project is to be calculated the process
is to calculate the variance of the
whole project and then take its square
root to calculate the standard deviation
of the project concept-based questions
on per can be expected in the PMP exam
so make a note of the formula while you
prepare for the exam
in the next screen let us understand per
with an example let us now figure out
how we can apply the three-point
estimation that per uses in order to
draw some useful
conclusions assume that the optimistic
pessimistic and most likely estimates
are 20 70 and 30 respectively using
these values you can determine the
expected duration and the standard
deviation as indicated now if the causes
of variation are random you can assume
that the actual values would be evenly
distributed about the mean and will
follow the normal
distribution sometimes referred to as
the bell curve further you can use the
properties of the normal
distribution there is a 68% probability
of the actual value falling within first
Sigma from the mean
95.4% probability for the second Sigma
and 99 7% probability of the actual
value falling within third Sigma
extending this Logic the notion of Six
Sigma is reaching a level of confidence
that only 3.4 times out of a million
would the actual value fall outside the
stated range per allows you to plan
based on the intended level of
confidence in the outcome and determine
buffers
accordingly let us discuss the critical
path method in the next screen critical
path is is defined as the longest
duration path through a network diagram
which determines the shortest time to
complete the project float can be
considered as a buffer time available to
complete an activity float is calculated
once the network diagram is ready it is
also called as slack there are three
kinds of float the first being the total
float which is the amount of time an
activity can be delayed without delaying
the project end date or an intermediate
Milestone the second type of flute is
free flute which is the amount of time
an activity can be delayed without
delaying the early start date of its
successor or successor's
activities the last type is independent
flute which is the amount of time an
activity can be delayed if all the
predecessors finish at their latest
finish dates and you want to start all
the immediate successors at their
earliest start dates the slack of the
activity on the critical path is zero
because there is no scope to delay
activities on the critical path critical
path actually represents the project
duration delaying activities on the
critical path is as good as delaying the
project duration concept-based questions
on critical path can be expected in the
exam so it is essential to have a clear
understanding of the concept in the next
screen let us learn how to calculate
float
float of an activity can be calculated
by two methods however the first step
and critical path method is to identify
the critical path of the network once
the critical path is identified follow
the forward path to find early start and
early finish for each
activity the float of the activities on
the critical path is zero so they
represent the overall project duration
use forward pass or backward pass to
calculate calculate the total activity
time calculate late finish and late
start using backward pass method note
the total float formula before you start
for the exam in the next screen let us
look at forward pass and backward pass
methods in detail in forward pass you
can either go through the network
starting with time zero and keep
calculating the time required to
complete each of the activities until
you reach the last activity of the
project
the starting time for each of the
activity in this approach is called
early start and the end time for each
activity is called the early finish
alternatively in backward pass you can
travel through the network from the
project and date and calculate the time
required to complete each activity the
end date in this approach is called the
late finish and the start date of the
activity in this approach is called the
late start the float of the ACT AC ity
is either the difference between the
late start and early start or the
difference between the late finish and
early
finish both the differences work out to
be the same before the start of the PMP
exam please make a note of the total
float formula let us understand the
critical path calculation with an
example in the next
screen let us look at an example for
critical path there are five activities
in this project and two paths in the
network diagram start 1 2 4 5 end is One
path and start 1 3 5 end is the second
path since the duration of the path
start 1 2 4 5 end is 18 days which is
more than the duration of the path start
1 35 and the critical path of the
project is start 1 2 4 5 and let us take
Activity three as an example first
calculate the early start and early
finish dates Activity 3 can start only
after Activity 1 since the early finish
of Activity 1 is three it becomes the
early start of Activity 3 Activity 3
cannot start earlier than three because
Activity one can be completed only by
then therefore early start of Activity 3
is three since the duration of the
activity is 4 days the early finish of
Activity 3 is 3 + 4 = 7 days now let us
calculate the late start and late finish
of Activity 3 late start of Activity 5
is 14 days the Activity three happens
just before Activity 5 so the late
finish of Activity 3 is 14 days to
calculate the late start you can
subtract the duration from late finish
therefore the late start of Activity 3
is 14- 4 = 10 in the next screen let us
focus on schedule
compression look at the four activities
in the table the normal cost of
executing each of the activities as well
as how much each of the activities can
be crashed is also provided which
activity would you crash to reduce the
project Time by by one day activity a
will be crashed if the duration of the
project is reduced by one day as the per
unit cost of crashing the activity a is
the least all the activities are assumed
to be on the critical path here while
crashing if you end up Saving Time on a
path which is not the critical path you
will not end up Saving Time on the
project in the next screen let us look
into the impact of schedule
compression different schedule
compression techniques have different
impact on the project the impact of Fast
Track leads to risk additions and
increase in management time for the
project manager crash leads to cost
addition and increase in management time
for the project manager reduced scope on
the other hand saves cost and resources
but increases customer
dissatisfaction likewise cut quality
saves cost and resour sources but
increases risk resource reallocation
does not add cost or increase risk in
the next screen let us look into the
other techniques used in
scheduling there are several techniques
that are used in scheduling
projects what if scenario analysis in
this technique questions like what if a
particular scenario changed on the
project would that produce a shorter
schedule are put forth to understand the
impact of specific changes on the
schedule the goal is to produce a
realistic schedule Monte Carlo analysis
in this method a computer simulates the
outcomes of a project making use of
randomly generated values that map the
probability distribution of the input
variables together these two techniques
are called modeling
techniques resource optimization
techniques these are also used used to
produce a resource Limited schedule
resource optimization results in more
stable number of resources used in the
project critical chain method this
technique develops the project schedule
that takes into account both the
activity and resource
dependencies in the next screen let us
look at the last process and project
time management control schedule control
schedule is concerned with determining
the status of the project schedule
determining that the project schedule
has changed and managing the actual
changes as they occur the project
schedule is an important input to this
process it is the actual schedule that
needs to be controlled scheduled data
contains information related to the
schedule that may need to be monitored
in order to take actions to bring the
project back on
schedule project calendar describes the
working hours and days for the project
work performance data has information
like which activities have started their
progress and which activities have
finished the other inputs of this
process are project management plan and
organizational process assets the key
tools and techniques of this process are
the performance reviews performance
review is measuring comparing and
analyzing schedule performance such as
actual start and finish dates percent
complete and remaining duration for work
in progress the other tools and
techniques include resource optimization
techniques modeling techniques schedule
compression leads and lags scheduling
tool and project management software in
development schedule process these
techniques are used for the first time
to develop the project schedule whereas
in control schedule process these
techniques are used to update the
project schedule the key output of the
control schedule process is the work
performance information this is
represented in the form of schedule
variance SV and schedule performance
index
SPI as a part of the control schedule
process the project team will generate
forecasts like schedule for forthcoming
activities and project as a
whole the other outputs include
organizational process assets updates
change requests project management plan
updates and project document updates if
you are looking to become a skilled
project manager have a look at the
post-graduate program in project
management by simply line there are 47
processes in project management grouped
into 10 10 knowledge areas and mapped to
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the fourth knowledge area
that is Project cost management and its
processes in the next screen let us
understand the concept of project cost
management project cost management
involves activities like estimating the
cost of each of the project activities
adding the cost estimates of the related
activities to arrive at the cost budget
and control contr in the cost to ensure
that project activities are completed
within the defined budget in the next
screen let us discuss cost management
plan the cost management plan is a vital
step in Project cost management it
contains information like planning the
project cost managing and controlling
the project in relation to the cost
Baseline and managing cost variances
project cost management plan is a part
of the project management plan the
methods used in estimating the cost of
each of the project activities are
similar to the ones used in estimating
project time for example time estimation
methods like expert judgment analogous
estimating bottom up estimating and
Reserve analysis are few of the
techniques that are also used in
estimating activity cost let us discuss
control account in the next screen
control count is an important Concept in
the project cost management project cost
is generally estimated at individual
activity level it becomes difficult to
manage cost at the activity level in
large projects therefore the cost is
managed at a higher level this requires
related activities to be clubbed and
their cost being managed together as one
unit this unit is called control account
while estimating the project time WBS is
created to break down the project into
smaller
deliverables these deliverables are
broken down into work packages and these
work packages are in turn broken into
activities control account is defined at
a level higher than the work packages
for example if five work packages are
part of the one control account the cost
of all activities belonging to these
five work packages are managed as one
unit in the next screen let us discuss
the project cost management
process project cost management has four
processes they are plan cost management
estimate costs determined budget and
control costs the three processes Plan
cost management estimate costs and
determined budget are a part of planning
process group and control cost process
is a part of monitoring and controlling
process group
group let us look at each of these
processes in detail let us begin with
the first process that is Plan cost
Management in the next
screen managing costs on a project is a
critical exercise if the activities are
planned well it becomes easier to
achieve harmony with the overall cost
and budget of the project Plan cost
management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning managing
expending and controlling the project
costs let us look at the inputs required
for this
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and
guides the cost planning activities on
the project the project Charter provides
an overall context and highlevel product
and project description which help
determine the approach for cost
management for example for some projects
budget could be a constraint
whereas for others budget would not be a
constraint but subject to the other
objectives Enterprise environmental
factors provide the organizational
context to the project including the
culture of the organization and the
infrastructure for instance the
scheduling systems available the key
personnel and so on organizational
process assets provide inputs such as
policies and procedures templates past
performance data and estimates
historical information and knowledge
base now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources experts can devise
an approach to govern the costs on a
project by using their previous
experiences meetings may be organized to
determine the cost management plan
everyone responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager representatives from the
appropriate accounting or financial
organization sponsor customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the cost management
plan these techniques help to map the
impact of various decisions on cost for
example how do riskmanagement processes
impact cost
Etc cost management plan is the primary
output of this process it establishes
the units of measure levels of precision
organizational process links control
accounts to be used rules for
performance measurement and Reporting
frequency and methodology of monitoring
the costs and various other details that
lay the overall framework for cost
Management on a
project in the next screen let us
discuss the second process under project
cost management
estimate
cost estimate cost is the approximation
of the monetary resources required to
complete a project activity cost of a
specific activity is estimated based on
the information available at that point
of time as the project team gets more
information about the project the
activity cost estimation may change let
us look at the inputs of this
process scope Baseline is the most
important input as it Tails out the
project scope of work along with that
project schedule is also important this
contains information like when and which
resource is required for the project it
is good to remember that the same kind
of resources may have different costs at
different points of time Human Resource
Management plan is another important
input various elements like Personnel
rates Rewards or recognition programs
Etc are covered in the human resource
management plan which is important in
approximating the cost estimate Human
Resource Management plan will be
discussed in detail in the human
resource management knowledge
area risk register is also an input
because risk mitigation costs should be
considered in cost planning more
information on risk and its effect in
the project will be looked at in detail
in riskmanagement knowledge area another
input Enterprise environmental factors
provides organizational context to the
project organization process asset is
listed as an input as organizations
might have standard set of cost
estimation policies or
templates cost management plan is
another important input the cost
management plan lays the framework for
the cost management processes in the
project it provides guidelines such as
the units of measure accuracy desired
methodologies and tools to be used Etc
let us now look at the tools and
techniques used in this
process expert judgment Reserve analysis
analogous estimating cost of quality
parametric estimating project management
software bottomup estimating three-point
estimating vendor bid analysis and group
decision- making are the various tools
and techniques used in this process
most of the tools and techniques used
here are similar to the ones used in the
time management knowledge
area vendor bid analysis is a technique
used to estimate project cost for
example a project requires material
procured externally through suppliers in
order to get that you invite bids from
three or four suppliers and assess their
quotations based on their quotations you
can get an idea of the cost that will be
involved D in getting the material for
the project group decision- making
technique is another important technique
for project cost estimation cost
estimation is an exercise which may be
carried out by a group or Committee in
order to gather well-rounded input
therefore group decision-making
techniques may be used to arrive at a
decision that team can work with the
outputs of this process are quite
straightforward estimates of each of the
activities are arrived at based bis of
the estimate includes things like how
the estimate was developed what were the
assumptions made in estimating
Etc project document updates is also one
of the outputs because the cost
estimates may result in updates to other
aspects of the project for example
quality risk time Etc in the next screen
let us discuss the third process under
project cost management determine
budget once the s estimate of each of
the activities is arrived at the next
project cost management process is to
determine budget it is the process of
aggregating the estimated cost of
individual activities or work packages
to establish an authorized cost Baseline
this is where the control account
concept comes into picture the estimated
costs of the activities are aggregated
to arrive at the cost budget at the
control account level once approved this
cost budget becomes the cost Baseline of
the project project cost performance is
measured against the cost Baseline that
is how much more would the project cost
be compared to the original cost
Baseline the cost Baseline includes all
authorized budgets but excludes
management
reserves the inputs used in determining
the project budget are the activity cost
estimates and the basis of estimates
which are the output of the previous
cost management process
the cost management plan lays the
framework for the cost management
processes in the project it provides
guidelines such as the budgeting cycle
tools and techniques used to prepare and
approve the budget Etc and addition to
these two important inputs scope
Baseline is also looked at project
schedule provides aggregate cost in a
particular calendar period to ensure how
much money can be made available during
that time
similarly resource calendar provides
information on the resource which is
assigned to the project at a particular
point of time this information is then
used to indicate resource costs over the
duration of the project risk register
gives an understanding of the overall
level of risk on the project and
therefore the level of contingency
reserves that need to be built into the
budget agreements entered into with the
suppliers are also required to find ize
the budget again organizational process
asset is an input because organization
may have few policies for reporting the
cost budget or there might be some cost
budgeting tools being used there are
various tools and techniques used in
determining budgets cost aggregation
technique involves adding up the cost
and aggregating them at the control
account level so that the cost can be
managed in a better way in reserve
analysis want once the costs are
estimated some extra amount is added to
the estimate as a management Reserve to
take care of any unplanned
activities expert judgment is a
technique in which an expert's help is
sought to estimate the activity cost
expert is someone who might have worked
on a similar project in the past and has
a good idea to estimate the activity
cost involved historical relationships
are used to predict the total project
cost using mathematical model this is
similar to analogous estimate or
parametric estimate method funding limit
reconciliation technique is used to
ensure that cost on the project is
budgeted or spent as per the
availability of the fund for example if
the project can get the funding of only
$50,000 a month the project budget
should be planned
accordingly the output of this process
is the cost Baseline this is an
authorized project budget over a period
this is used to measure Monitor and
control overall cost performance of the
project in addition to this the Project
funding requirements are also arrived at
funding requirements means how much fund
the project requires monthly quarterly
or yearly for the
execution the last output of this
process is Project document updates an
understanding of determining budget may
be useful when answering questions in
the PMP exam
so make a note of the inputs tools and
techniques and outputs of determining
budget in the next screen let us discuss
the last process of project cost
management that is control cost control
costs is the process of monitoring the
status of the project to update the
project budget and managing changes to
the cost Baseline updating the budget
involves recording actual costs spent
until date any increase to the
authorized budget can only be approved
through the perform integrated Change
Control process some of the typical
activities that happen as part of the
control cost process are ensuring that
cost expenditure does not exceed the
authorized funding monitor the cost
performance to understand variance and
monitoring the work performance against
the funds expended the inputs to the
process are project management plan
organizational process assets Project
funding requirements and work
performance data work performance data
contains the information about the
project progress the important tools and
techniques used in controlling costs are
earned value analysis management
forecasting to complete performance
index other important aspects of
controlling costs are the review the
performance analyze the reserves to make
sure the project has enough budgetary
reserves to meet the expenses and
project management software which helps
in tracking and managing costs now let
us look at the output of this
process the key outputs of this process
are work performance information in
terms of cost variance CV schedule
variance SV and earned value EV and
forecasts about the cost performance the
this process may also result in change
requests arising out of cost control
measures as well as updates to project
documents the project management plan
and organizational process assets
business scenario based questions on
Project cost control can be expected in
the exam so if you have questions on
these Concepts get them cleared as that
will help you score higher in the next
screen let us learn about earned value
management and it related
terms earned value technique is an
excellent way to track the project
progress against the project plan it is
a method of measuring the project
performance objectively and comparing it
against the project Baseline results
from an earned value analysis indicate
deviation of the project from cost and
schedule
baselines Baseline is the initial
approved value along with approved
changes therefore schedule Baseline is
the first approved project schedule
along with approved changes there are
various terms used in earned value
technique planned value is the
authorized budget assigned to the
scheduled work earned value is the work
performed in terms of budget authorized
for that work actual cost is the cost
incurred in work performed budget at
completion is the budgeted amount for
the total work estimate at completion is
the expected total cost for the project
estimate to complete is the expected
cost to finish all the remaining Project
work variance at completion is the
projected budget surplus or deficit at
the end of the project all the
parameters displayed on the screen are
measured in terms of cost you may come
across business scenario based questions
on earned value Management in the PMP
exam so ensure that you develop a clear
understanding of this topic let us look
at an example of a planned value in the
next
screen planned value is the estimated
value of the work planned this value is
measured in terms of currency say dollar
if the plan value is
$340 then the work plann is worth
$340 how do you calculate earned value
the solution is add the budget allocated
to each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value in
the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned
value in cost variance negative means
the project is over budget positive
means the project is under budget
similarly in schedule variance negative
means the project is behind schedule
whereas positive means the project is
ahead of schedule the value of the next
two parameters cost performance index
CPI and schedule performance index and
SPI values vary between 0 and 1 for
example a CPI of 0.8 implies that 80
cents of work is obtained for every
dollar spent in the project similarly if
SPI is
0.9 it implies that project is
progressing at only 90% of the speed
originally planned the next parameter is
estimate at completion or
EAC there are different ways of
calculating the e AC value the method
used depends on how the cost and
schedule variances are expected to play
for the rest of the project BAC by CPI
is used if you expect that the current
cost performance will continue until the
end of the project AC plus BAC minus EV
is used if you expect that the rest of
the project will be managed at the
budgeted rate AC plus BAC minus EV by
the product of CPI I and SBI is used if
you want to factor in the impact of the
cost as well as schedule
variances AC plus Etc is used if you
want to re-evaluate the Project based on
a forecast value for the estimated cost
of the remainder of the project the next
parameter is estimate to complete or Etc
which is the cost of project from this
point to the end this is calculated by
subtracting the actual cost from the
estimate at completion in addition
variance at completion can be calculated
by subtracting the estimate at
completion from the budget at completion
variance at completion is the cost
estimation whether it is over or under
budget another parameter is the to
complete performance index or
tcpi this is the cost performance needed
to achieve a desired
outcome for example if the project needs
to be managed to the or budget BAC then
tcpi that is the CPI that must be
maintained for the rest of the project
is calculated as BAC minus EV by BAC
minus
AC similarly if it has to be managed
within a revised Target say EAC then
tcpi is calculated as BAC minus EV by
EAC minus AC before the start of the PMP
exam please make a note of the formulas
of earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer let us take
the example of a software development
project there are four phases and each
phase takes a month to complete and is
expected to cost
$10,000 the phases are planned to be
completed one after the other the status
of the project at the end of the month
three is summarized in the
table requirements definition is
completed and actual spending on this is
$110,000 architecture and design is done
and actual spending on this is
$122,000 development and unit testing is
only 50% done though it was supposed to
be completed by Third month it has cost
$99,000 until date system testing and go
live has not yet started Note S
indicates start time F indicates finish
time and PF indicates that it is partly
finished at the end of the month based
on the above information calculate the
CV SV CPI and SPI of the project let us
look at a solution in the next
screen before we end this lesson let us
also look at a few definitions that
might be useful for your PMP examination
law of diminishing return this means the
more you put into something the less you
get out of it for example doubling the
number of resources working on a project
will not necessarily have the time
working capital the amount of money the
company has to invest on the project and
the day-to-day company operations
funding limit reconciliation the process
of comparing the planned expenditure in
a given period with the available
funding for that period large assets
purchased by the company lose value over
time this is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight line and
accelerated same amount of depreciation
is taken every year for instance a car
with a price tag of $10,000 and useful
life of 10 years is depreciated $11,000
per year at the end of the 10th year the
value of the car is considered zero for
all accounting purposes accelerated
depreciation depreciation faster than
the straight line depreciation for
instance a car with a price tag of
$10,000 depreciates $3,000 the first
year 1,500 the next year 1,000 the third
year and so on there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to five
process groups in this lesson we will
look at the fifth knowledge area that is
Project quality management management
and its processes in the next screen let
us understand what quality is the
project manager is responsible for
quality in a project however it is also
the responsibility of each and every one
in the project to ensure that whatever
they do meets project quality
expectations quality is defined as the
degree to which a set of inherent
characteristics fulfills requirements a
project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable usable means that the
intended users can use the product
without any problem in the next screen
let us look at some quality related
terms it is important to discuss a few
terms to understand the concept of
quality better customer satisfaction is
defined as conformance to requirements
and fitness for use it is important to
understand the subtle distinction
between quality and grade grade is a
classification based on technical
characteristics low quality is always a
problem but low grade may not be a
problem rather it would be a matter of
choice similarly it is important to
understand the distinction between
precision and accuracy precision is the
granularity of measurement that is how
fine grained can you measure the outcome
accuracy is how correct you are that is
how close you are to the desired value
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of optimal level of
Quality quality comes at a cost more
effort put in quality will give better
results however you cannot keep on
investing on increasing the quality as
there is no limit to how much a product
can be improved investment in quality is
determined by knowing the optimal level
of quality optimal level of quality as
shown in the diagram is said to be
achieved at the point where the
incremental revenue from Improvement
equals the incremental cost to secure it
suppose you are the manufacturer of toys
but the toys are below quality and the
sales are low to improve the quality you
invest in identifying the demands of
children sharing few samples and
recording their feedbacks once all these
are captured and implemented in the
products you lure the parents to buy
them as the investment is increased to
manufacture good quality toys the cost
will therefore increase and it might
become prohibitive for parents to buy
optimal level of quality is reached at a
point where you get maximum number of
buyers for the toys manufactured now
that we are clear on the concept of
quality in the next screen let us
discuss quality
management quality management involves
performing activities like creating
standard policies and procedures and
ensuring that those standard procedures
are being followed properly in the
project it aims to ensure that project
meets all the initial agreed
requirements without any deviation and
that the specified approach to Quality
is implemented on the project three
broad activities are done as part of
quality management they are quality
planning quality assurance and quality
control quality planning is the first
step when quality related activities of
the project are planned quality
assurance is the next stage of
implementing those quality plans and
quality control is the last stage when
periodic checks are done to see if
project quality is
improving in the next screen let us look
into the differences between the three
aspects of quality
management it is important to understand
the different kinds of activities that
come under quality planning quality
assurance and quality control once the
quality planning is done the quality
management plan is ready this quality
management plan has standards templates
policies and procedures to be followed
in the project it contains information
on the level of quality being aimed and
the plan to achieve that level it is the
aim of quality assurance activities to
ensure that the activities planned under
quality planning phase gets executed for
the project it is the task of quality
assurance to determine if the project
project is complying with the
organizational as well as project
policies and procedures this is ensured
by conducting regular process audits to
identify deviation from what is planned
in the quality management plan these
audits are generally done by quality
Department of the organizations quality
assurance focuses on the process not on
specific products the role of quality
control is to measure specific project
data or results against standards to
inspect and verify the Project's product
defect repair and measure whether
quality indicators are improving quality
control is about the product and data
for example it was planned as part of
quality management that project would
get completed plus or minus 10% within
the cost budget 3 months back when the
measurement was done project was over
budget by
20% when the measurement was done a day
before it was only 15% over budget
therefore the project has showed an
improvement of 5% in the last 3 months
and it is quite likely that over the
next 3 months project may get within the
planned limit of 10% instead of showing
Improvement if the data shows cost
increase then corrective and
preventative actions are required to get
the project within the 10% limit this is
quality control in the next screen let
us discuss a few quality management
Concepts let us look at some terms that
are commonly used in quality management
pars total quality management or tqm is
a quality management philosophy that
involves holistic thinking about meeting
the objectives of an organization it
places the responsibility of quality
squarely on the management Kaizen is a
Japanese term that stands for change for
better Kaizen philosophy is one that
should always be looking for small and
continuous improvements in the process
deeming cycle or pdca cycle that is plan
du check Act is a process control and
Improvement approach propagated by the
famous quality Guru Edward deing it
means you plan for something execute it
check the output and based on the
lessons you act to bring the deviations
under control kban is a poll-based
management system that originated in
Japan based on just in time jit
Inventory management the idea behind
kban is to minimize the work in progress
and achieve a smooth flow in the process
from start to finish because building up
inventory only to paper over the
imperfections in the system tends to
hide the problems in the next screen let
us focus on cost of
quality cost of quality is the cost that
needs to be incurred to make a quality
product the sum of all the costs
incurred is ensuring that project
conforms to requirement is cost of
quality cost of quality can be broken
down into two major categories first is
the cost of conformance or the money
spent during the project to avoid
failures this can further be subdivided
into prevention costs which is the cost
to prevent errors like training the team
creating documents on equipment and in
time to do it right the other
subdivision is appraisal costs or the
cost for assessing quality like testing
destructive testing loss and inspections
the second category is the cost of
non-conformance it is the money spent
during and after the project because of
failures this is subdivided into
internal failure costs it is the cost of
failures that occur before the product
is released to customers for example
rework and scrap the second subdivision
is external failure costs it is cost
incurred on failures that occur after it
has been released by the team for
example liabilities warranty work and
lost business concept-based questions on
cost of quality can be expected in the
exam so please make a note of the
categories of cost of quality let us
look at the project quality management
processes in the next screen
there are three project quality
management processes of which the first
process plan quality management is done
as part of the planning process group
the next process perform quality
assurance is done as part of the
executing process group and the last
process control quality is done as part
of the monitoring and controlling
process group in the next three screens
let us look into each of these processes
in detail
the aim of the plan quality management
process is to identify the relevant
requirements or standards to execute the
project effectively to achieve the
desired quality level quality planning
results in the creation of the quality
management
plan aim of the plan quality process is
to identify the standards a standard is
an agreed upon process to work or
achieve a result a standard can be set
from within the organization or
government once all the standards for
the project are identified the aim of
the quality planning activities involves
determining what work needs to be done
to meet those standards before adhering
to the standards you should question
their relevance with the project
implementing all possible standards
applicable to the project in random will
have cost and time
implications let us look at the inputs
to this
process the project management plan
provides the scope scope schedule and
cost Baseline all of which have an
implication on the quality management
plan quality plan has a direct
correlation with these it might also
have an impact on and be impacted by
other subsidiary management plans such
as risk management the stakeholders of
the project may have specific
requirements and Views about the quality
parameters of the project and these have
to be considered the risk register gives
an indication about the kind of risks
that are inherent in the project and
also those which must be considered
while planning the activities to ensure
quality the requirements for the project
need to be considered for planning
quality related activities because
quality is all about meeting the
requirements in addition to these
Enterprise environmental factors and
organization process assets are also
listed as inputs because the standards
can be either from within the
organization or from government or other
external bodies standards from within
the organizations are usually the best
practices learned over a period while
executing numerous projects an example
of government standards can be standards
to control air pollution by the motor
vehicles which vehicle manufacturers
must adhere to to accomplish quality
planning first analyze the benefits
versus the costs of meeting quality
requirements next identify the cost of
quality and confirm if that kind of
investment in quality is Justified in
addition to these two benchmarking helps
in analyzing the quality of activities
of similar projects executed in the past
this helps in identifying the particular
quality of output of the previous
project which in turn acts as a basis
for the current Project's quality
planning this design of experiments can
also be used for Quality planning this
is a statistical way to determine what
variables will improve quality the most
for example in case of manufacturing
doors it can be determined that
increasing the quality of the wood can
have Maximum Impact on improving the
quality of the door in addition the
seven basic quality tools also known as
the 7 QC tools are used to determine the
plan to achieve the desired level of
quality statistical sampling as a tool
becomes relevant whenever the quality
plan cannot be applied to all the
artifacts produced for example if
destructive testing is a requirement
then it can be carried out only on a
sample not on the entire
population statistical sampling helps in
arriving at a representative sample that
can give useful
information other additional tools such
as bra brainstorming force field
analysis Etc may be used to determine
the quality management plan for the
project conducting regular meetings is
another important tool the quality
management plan has to be determined in
a collaborative manner by Consulting the
team members and other
stakeholders quality management plan is
a key output of this
process checklist is a list of items to
inspect for example many of the office
buildings have housekeeping checklists
to ensure that all floors cabins Etc are
cleaned checklists are created during
quality planning and used in quality
control metrics are Project Specific
data that need to be measured to check
the status of the project the simplest
project metrics can be cost and schedule
metrics are also decided during quality
planning and used in quality control one
of the roles of the project manager is
to not only manage the project but also
improve processes in the project to
decrease the instances of defects which
in turn saves time and money such
activities are listed in the process
Improvement plan which eventually
becomes part of project management plan
as a result of the planning activities
other project documents may also get
updated for example the quality
management plan may result in updates to
the cost or resource requirements there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the plan quality management process
so please ensure you have a fair
understanding of the concept before you
take the
exam in the next screen let us discuss
the second quality management
process once the quality planning is
over the next process and project
quality management is quality assurance
which involves determining whether the
standards are being met and the
processes are being followed therefore
the input for this process is the work
that has been completed during the
quality planning stage they are project
documents quality management plan
process Improvement plan quality metrics
and quality control measurements let us
look at the tools and techniques used in
this process quality audit is the
process to check whether the project is
complying with the organ ganization
policies standards and procedures and
determine whether these policies
standards and procedures used are
efficient and effective so a good audit
not only looks at this compliance but
also for the new Lessons Learned From
the current project that can help make
the future projects better process
analysis involves using the lessons
learned from doing the initial few work
to make the remaining work more
efficient for example if the project
involves installing a software package
then the lesson learned from the first
few installations can be used to improve
the process on remaining
installations apart from these all the
quality management and control tools
such as the seven basic quality tools
will be relevant to this process the key
output of this process is Project
documents updates to ensure that if
there is any deviation from agreed
standards it is corrected also so if
there are any lessons learned that can
help improve the future projects the
organization process assets get updated
this quality assurance may result in
Improvement suggestions change requests
may be generated and the project
management plan may need to be
updated understanding characteristics of
quality assurance tools and techniques
may be useful while answering the exam
so prepare this topic well before you
take the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the last process of quality
management the key focus of the quality
control activities is on the correctness
of the work quality control helps answer
questions like is everything okay with
the project does the project plan
require changes to successfully execute
the project will the project succeed Etc
let us look at the inputs to this
process the quality metrics measure
measurements are done continuously to
see whether the project quality is
improving the project deliverables are
inspected against the plann checklists
quality control acts upon the
deliverables and work performance data
produced in execution it also refers to
the project management plan for
understanding deviations from the plan
it also considers the approved change
requests information from other project
documents and organization process
assets there are seven popular tools and
techniques used in doing the quality
control activities they are collectively
known as seven basic tools of quality
other relevant tools are statistical
sampling inspection or testing and
review of the approved changes quality
control activities result in quality
control measurements the verified
deliverables validated changes
information about the work being
performed recommended changes and
updates to the organizational process
assets project management plan and other
project
documents in the next screen let us look
into a business scenario to understand
this concept better after reading the
problem statement click the solution
button to look at a possible answer Six
Sigma is a highly disciplined process
that focuses on developing and
delivering near-perfect products and
services consistently if large volume of
data is plotted over a period of time
you would most probably have a
bell-shaped graph such graphs are also
called normal distribution graph it's
called as normal distribution because
any large volume of data is plotted with
the intent to track variations would
most probably be in a bell-shaped curve
the line corresponding to the top of the
bell curve is the median of the data
sample standard deviation concept is
used to measure how far any data is from
the mean standard deviation is also
called Sigma one standard deviation from
the mean covers 68% of the data 6 Sigma
means six standard deviations from the
mean this would cover
99.999 66% of the
data we will look at an example of Six
Sigma in the following screen to
understand Six Sigma let us look at an
example a tire Manufacturing Company
produces 100,000 tires a day it is not
possible to verify each and every Tire
manually to ensure it is defect free
instead random sample of these
manufactured tires are taken and checked
for defects assuming that the thickness
of the tires is a parameter to measure
defect any tire that has a thickness
more than or less than 10 mm is
considered to be defective now if you
measure the the actual thickness of all
100,000 tires manufactured daily and
plot them on a graph you get normal
distribution graph one standard
deviation from the mean covers 68% of
the data meaning if the thickness of the
100,000 tires are plotted 68,000 of them
lie within one standard deviation above
or below the mean now if a company
operates at Six Sigma level they would
ensure that all tires that are up to six
standard deviations from the mean are
defect free therefore in such cases you
can expect only three defective tires
out of a million tires manufactured let
us now check your understanding of the
topics covered in this
lesson here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson a project is said
to meet quality expectations when all
the project requirements agreed in the
beginning of the project are met and the
resulting product is usable
quality management includes creating and
following policies and procedures that
meet the Project's defined quality
needs quality planning defines the
standards templates policies and
procedures quality assurance determines
if the project is complying with the
policies and procedures quality control
measures specific project results
against standards plan quality
management perform quality assurance and
control quality are the three project
quality management
processes seven basic quality tools are
used to plan and achieve the desired
levels of quality at Six Sigma level
there would be only three defects out of
a million units manufactured if you are
looking to become a skilled project
manager have a look at the post-graduate
program in project management by simply
lar project Human Resource Management
includes the processes that organize
manage and lead the project team one of
the key elements of human resource
management is that each of the project
team members should have clear
assignment of their roles and
responsibilities in addition even the
team working on project management tasks
should be a part of the project team and
they are responsible for project
management functions like initiating
planning executing monitoring and
controlling and closing along with other
leadership activities in the next screen
let us understand the difference between
functional and project
manager an organization may have both
functional managers and project managers
the difference functional manager is the
one who handles a business function or
department for instance the HR manager
is responsible for the HR department in
an organization therefore an HR Manager
will be a functional manager generally a
functional manager is also a subject
matter expert the roles and
responsibilities of the functional
manager depend upon the core business of
the organization and overall
organization structure functional
managers normally own the resources and
provide the projects with necessary
resources they also negotiate with the
project manager regarding resources the
project manager on the other hand is
responsible and accountable for the
success or failure of a project and the
quality of the project they are not
technical experts the project manager
may not have authority over the
resources depending upon the
organizational structure they often have
to negotiate with the functional manager
for the resources and are responsible
for the product quality a project
manager will credit the team with the
success of the project and accept the
blame for the failure now let us look at
an example to understand the roles
played by functional and project
managers the CEO of an organization
initiates a new project to secure an ISO
91208 certification for the company now
this project would require team members
from each of the company departments and
whoever is the project manager of this
project will have to request the
functional manager to assign one of
their team members to the project
resources assigned to the project go
back to their respective departments
once the project is completed let us now
discuss the project Human Resource
Management processes in the next screen
there are four project Human Resource
Management processes the first process
plan human resource management is done
as part of the planning process group
the next three processes are part of the
executing process group these processes
are acquir project team
develop project team and manage project
team let us now look into each of these
processes in detail in the next screen
let us begin with plan Human Resource
Management plan human resource
management is the process of identifying
and documenting project roles
responsibilities required skills
reporting relationships and creating a
staffing management plan this process is
part of the plan process group in
addition to that finalizing the project
hierarchy of who reports to whom and
designing the Staffing management plan
is also part of this process the first
input to this process is the project
management plan there could be a lot of
information in the project management
plan and subsidiary plans that may be
relevant to the creation of the human
resource management plan for example the
Project Life Cycle processes the
timeline
how the work will be accomplished Etc
the other key input for this process is
the activity resource requirement team
members can be identified based on these
requirements in addition to this
Enterprise environmental factors like
current employment Outlook Etc are also
important for example if the economy is
booming and there are ample job
opportunities for the team members the
reward and recognition system can keep
the project team interested in the
project organizational process asset is
also an input to this process an example
of the organization process assets can
be template or a form to request for a
new resource let us now look at the
tools and techniques used to develop
human resource plan the roles and
responsibilities are captured in the
form of organization charts and position
descriptions there are various ways to
draw this chart it can be either
hierarchical chart which shows the
reporting function or it can be text
based the other technique used for
developing the human resource plan is
networking this involves formal or
informal interactions within the
organization and outside by the project
manager to identify the best team for
the project depending upon various
interpersonal factors organizational
Theory helps to understand how IND
individuals come together and function
as an
organization expert judgment and
meetings are required to put the human
resource plan together the output of
this process is human resource
management plan this plan contains
documents like Staffing management plan
project organization chart and roles and
responsibilities
Matrix the Staffing management plan is a
comprehensive document that describes
when and how team members would be added
to and released from the project another
component of the Staffing management
plan is the recognition and reward
system recognition and reward system
helps project managers motivate their
team the Staffing management plan is
relevant to the projects of a functional
or Matrix organization where project
team members are always caught in a
dilemma about prioritizing Project work
against regular departmental work in the
next screen let us discuss organization
charts and role
descriptions a project manager needs to
make sure that there is an organization
chart prepared specifically for the
project it should clearly identify the
roles and the reporting relationships
between them a sample organization chart
is shown on the slide another way of
clearly delineating responsibilities
among team members is by using a
responsibility assignment Matrix one
form of responsibility assignment Matrix
is the ra ACI chart in the ra ACI chart
R stands for responsible a for
accountable C for concerned or consulted
and I for informed for each important
activity or deliverable on the project
it needs to be clearly identified who is
responsible or contributes to it who is
ultimately accountable who is merely
concerned about the success and who
needs to be informed or kept in the loop
an example of the ra ACI chart is shown
on the screen in this case project
manager John is accountable for the
project plan and the other team members
Chris Sally and Ting are responsible for
completing the plan similarly you can
note the roles of each resource in the
other activities in the next screen let
us understand resource
histogram resource histogram is a method
of depicting how many resources are
required for the life of a project if
You observe the chart shown on the
screen it indicates that the number of
Staff hours required on the project
increases to a peak in 2014 and then
slowly tapers off especially for long
running projects the level of Staffing
needed may vary considerably over a
period This has implications for other
parts of the plan as well for example
the cost will vary as the number of
resources change this piece of
information helps a project manager to
understand at what time they need to
onboard and offboard resources on a
project in the next screen let us look
into the second human resource
management process that is acquire
project
team acquir project team is the process
of confirming human resource
availability and obtaining the team
necessary to complete project
activities this process belongs to the
executing process group acquiring
resources may not be required in the
planning phase therefore it is done in
execution phase though you may plan to
acquire few in the planning phase major
acquisition is done in execution phase
this may be true where large projects
are run spanning over many years with
several detailed activities the key
input is the human resource management
plan Enterprise environmental factors
help understand which team members will
be available to work on the project how
much they will cost Etc organizational
process assets will help understand the
hiring procedure of the company the
policies that govern the use of team
members on the project Etc the key
technique for acquiring the project team
is negotiation as a project manager you
have to negotiate with the company's
Senior Management resource manager or
with prospective candidates to to secure
the most suitable resources on the
project sometimes the resources may be
preassigned to a project this typically
happens when they are the key resources
without which the project cannot take
off sometimes the project team is
acquired by getting required resources
through external vendors most of the
bigger organizations have approved list
of vendors who provide resources on a
contractual basis nowadays the concept
of virtual team is also quite popular to
get a project team so even though the
project is being conceived in one
country a big part of the team can be in
another country for example if the
project is conceived in the USA majority
of the team can be in Germany and both
the teams can coordinate over the phone
email chat Etc multicriteria decision
analysis is also an important tool to
achieve the objectives while acquiring
the human resources for the project it
is important to consider a number of
factors such as availability cost skill
set experience attitude relocation needs
Etc these criteria have to be considered
in totality and balanced out against the
Project's requirements the output of
this process is Project staff
assignments resource calendars and
updates on project management plan let
us now discuss the next process develop
project team
once the project team is acquired the
next step is developing the project team
develop project team is the process of
improving competencies team member
interaction and overall team environment
to enhance project performance this
process belongs to the executing process
group the inputs to this process include
project staff assignments resource
calendars and Human Resource Management
plan one of the techniques used in
developing project team is interpersonal
skills it is more of an art than a
science and this is where individual
characteristics of project managers
matter a lot if the project manager
genuinely commands trust and respects
the team members developing the team
becomes easy team members look up to the
project manager not only for getting
Project Specific Instructions but also
for their career advancement as well
social activities like celebrating a
team member's birthday going for parties
outside the office Etc helps in team
building training is also an important
tool for developing the project team as
it helps in increasing the knowledge of
competencies of the team members
sometimes collocating the team members
at a single place also helps in
developing team bonding this is
especially important if team members
work from different geographical
locations knowing a person faced a to
face does help in reducing conflict
project managers can also encourage the
team members by providing recognition
and rewards Personnel assessment tools
give the project manager insights into
the strengths and opportunities for
improvement in the team members these
tools also help in understanding members
aspirations so that the project manager
can better align the project goals with
the individual aspirations finally the
project manager should also set some
ground rules rules in the project to
ensure that teen performs their work
without any problems some such rules can
be everyone should reach office for
daily meeting by 9:30 a.m. sharp if
there is more than a 10% delay in
completing any activity assigned it
should immediately be escalated to
project manager if there are any
unforeseen circumstances it should be
immediately brought to the notice of the
project manager Etc the output of this
process is team performance assess Ms
this is done by the project manager to
evaluate and enhance the effectiveness
of the team as a whole this is a
document which explains team
Effectiveness as information about the
team evolves the Enterprise
environmental factors may also be
updated questions that test a project
manager's role in developing a project
team can be expected in the PMP exam so
ensure that you have a fair
understanding of the role before you
take the exam in the next screen let let
us discuss the manage project team
process managing the project team is
different from developing the project
team though it is also done during the
execution process group it relates to
measuring team members performance
providing feedback resolving issues and
managing changes to optimize project
performance to measure team members
performance the manager should know the
work assigned to them as well as their
performance on the assigned work hence
project staff assignments and team
performance assessments are listed as
input to this process the human resource
management plan serves as a guideline
for managing project teams some
organizations have template and
procedures to do such assessment and
that being the reason why organization
process asset is also one of the inputs
to this process the work performance
reports as well as issue logs will be
inputs because the team management
activities have to be performed in this
context observation and conversation is
a technique where the project manager
monitors and discusses the tasks done by
the team this does not imply formal
project status reports but having an
informal interaction with the team
before documenting the project status
report knowing about the issue early
helps in resolving them early formal
performance appraisals are helpful in
evaluating the team members performance
on the project the project manager
creates these with the help of the team
supervisors it is an established
practice in most organizations to
evaluate team members for their work
this may have a bearing on their future
assignments salary promotions Etc since
the power of appraising lies within the
project manager the project manager can
use this as an effective tool for
managing the team since multiple
resources work on a single project it is
quite natural to expect conflicts it is
the responsibility of project manager to
resolve conflicts Conflict Management
has been discussed in detail later in
the lesson you can expect questions on
Conflict Management in the exam the
other tool is interpersonal skills the
output of managing a project team
includes corrective action
recommendations like which team members
to be changed implementing some reward
system to motivate the team Etc updating
the project management plans documents
organization process asset and
Enterprise environmental factors are the
other outputs of this process there can
be questions in the PMP exam that test a
project manager skill in managing a
project team so Ure that you are aware
of the inputs tools and techniques and
outputs of managing a project team let
us discuss Team Dynamics in the next
screen any team naturally goes through
several stages as it gets together
together these stages are forming
storming norming performing and
adjourning in forming stage a team
formally comes together for the first
time in storming stage disagreements
start to surface this is followed by
norming when the teams start working
together and trusting each other in
performing stage they are able to
deliver results as a team finally the
team is adjourned when the work of the
project is completed or the project is
terminated in the next screen let us
discuss Conflict
Management many organizations look for
people with diverse background to get
different perspectives about work if
people with diverse backgrounds and
culture work on a project it is quite
natural to expect conflict conflict
often results in opportunities for
improvement the root causes of conflict
can be scarce resources scheduling
priorities and personal work Styles
while the popular belief is that
personality or e can be the key reason
for conflict it is the least possible
reason for conflict as a project manager
if you find yourself in between a
conflict with a team member set across
the table and resolve it if not they
should get their immediate managers
involved and try to resolve it to avoid
conflicts a project manager should let
everyone involved have complete clarity
about the project assign the roles and
responsibilities to each of the team
members clearly ensure that there are no
overlap in responsibilities which could
be a possible cause for conflict
sometimes boredom at work can also lead
to conflict so one of the
responsibilities of project manager is
to keep motivating the team members and
let them work on interesting and
challenging assignments business
scenarios based questions on Conflict
Management can be expected in the PMP
exam so it is essential to have a fair
understanding of the topic in the next
screen let us look at conflict
resolution
techniques there are five techniques of
resolving conflict they are withdraw or
avoid smooth or accommodate compromise
or reconcile force or direct collaborate
or problem solve in withdraw or avoid
one Retreats from a potential conflict
situation or defers the resolution to a
later date this does not resolve the
conflict but allows for more time in
smooth or accommodate areas of agreement
are emphasized to reduce the intensity
of the conflict again this does not on
its own result in a resolution but it
may succeed in changing the perceptions
about the situation in compromise or
reconcile there is some give and take in
order to bring some satisfaction to all
parties depending on how the process
went this may be perceived as a wiwin or
a lose lose situation because none of
the parties really get what they want in
force or direct effect a person in a
position of authority directs how the
matter should be resolved it may be
necessary to do this when the matter has
to be resolved immediately however this
may result in upsetting one or more of
the conflicting parties in collaborate
or problem solving the parties in the
conflict are asked to come together to
collaborate and look for a resolution to
the problem this offers the greatest
likelihood of a satisfactory and
permanent resolution and should be
resorted to whenever possible business
scenario-based problems where a
resolution technique has to be selected
can be expected in the PMP exam so
understanding the conflict resolution
techniques is essential in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to get work done by the team there are
certain hours that a project manager can
use to get the work done a project
manager has to use a combination of
techniques to get this accomplished
various powers of a project manager are
legitimate or formal reward penalty
expert and referent in legitimate or
formal project manager can formally
assign a work to a team member that he
or she has to do project manager can
reward and recognize the team members
the reward could be as simple as
assigning challenging or or sought after
work to a team member this can motivate
good performers on the project sometimes
project manager can penalize the team
members for poor performance some
project managers are able to command
Authority because of their expertise in
a certain field project manager can be
considered as a reference of higher
authority to get the work done sometimes
referent Authority also arises from the
personal charm or Charisma of the
project manager legitimate reward and
penalty are the powers derived from the
project manager's position in the
company expert power exists when the
project manager is an expert on the
subject matter reward and expert are
usually the best forms of authority to
use penalty is the worst way of
influencing and managing the team a
project manager should resort to this
only as a last option regardless of the
project manager having formal reporting
authority over the team they are
naturally looked upon as the leaders for
their projects project managers need to
be familiar with the leadership styles
and be able to tailor their style
according to the needs of the project
and that of the team there are three
leadership styles the first one is
authoritarian or autocratic in this
style the leader sets clear expectations
of the team and expects complete
compliance in a participative or
Democratic style the leader offers
guidance but also involves the team in
decision-making in a delegated or L Fair
style the leader leaves the work to the
team without offering much guidance in
most circumstances you would want your
leader to employ a participative style
but there may be occasions when other
styles might be appropriate in the next
screen let us discuss McKenzie's 7s
framework a popular framework in
management science is the McKenzie's 7s
framework there are seven elements that
are divided into two categories and
organization working on a project will
have these elements already in place and
hence these become the hard elements the
first three elements of the 7s framework
are the strategy structure and systems
the leader or project manager is
expected to step in and exhibit soft
elements to earn the mantle of
leadership the next four elements are
shared values Skills style and staff
there are 47 processes and project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas
and mapped into five process groups in
this lesson we will look at the seventh
knowledge area that is Project
Communications management and its
processes in the next screen let us
understand
communication communication can be best
defined as a two-way process of
exchanging information between two
entities as you can see on the screen if
project is an entity the project needs
to communicate with other enti entities
in the organization like project
managers Senior Management of the
organization and any other stakeholder
of the project similarly these entities
may also have to communicate with the
projects the communication between
project and the stakeholders is always
two-sided project manager is responsible
for ensuring proper communication to and
from the project in fact a project
manager spends almost 90% % of his or
her time on communication you can now
understand how important it is for a
project manager to plan this activity
well in the next screen let us discuss
communication methods communication can
be done in two ways it can be done
written or verbal both written as well
as verbal communication can either be
formal or informal formal means
communicating by following some basic
rules
whereas informal means taking a casual
approach these two combinations result
in four different communication methods
they are formal written formal verbal
informal written and informal verbal
formal written method is used for
project management plans project Charter
and over longdistance communication
formal verbal method is used during
presentations whereas informal written
method is applicable while writing notes
or emails informal verbal on the other
hand is applied during
conversations you can expect questions
in the PMP exam which require choosing a
communication method for a given
situation so a fair understanding of the
communication methods can help you score
higher in the next screen let us look at
the various communication
Technologies communication technology
refers to the different media used for
Comm communicating a few such
Technologies are listed on screen among
which email facts and telephone are a
few popular communication Technologies
in the next screen let us understand the
communication Channel with the help of
an example communication takes place
between four people in a team the lines
across the members represent there can
be six unique channels of communication
existing within the team now if the team
comprises 10 members how many unique
channels of communication will be
calculated you can use the formula n
multiplied with
nus1 and the resulting sum divided by
two n is the total number of people
involved in communication in this case n
equals to 10 if this is put into the
formula you will get 45 as the result
therefore 45 unique communication
channels exist in a team te of 10 people
it is difficult to manage such a large
number of communication channels
therefore it is important to structure
communication otherwise everyone starts
communicating everything to everyone and
it can become a real chaos in the
project in the PMP exam you may be asked
to calculate the number of communication
channels in a scenario-based question so
please make a note of the formula to
answer the question correctly in the
next screen let us discuss the basic
communication model project
Communications management includes the
processes required to ensure that
information about timely and appropriate
generation collection distribution
storage and ultimate disposition of
project is prepared and circulated to
all project stakeholders it is the
responsibility of a project manager to
ensure that the information requested by
the stakeholder is communicated to them
the frequency at which the information
needs to be shared may also vary from
stakeholder to stakeholder for example
think about a simple process of sharing
a project status report with the
customer and Senior Management this
knowledge area explains how it should be
done as per
PMI in the next screen let us discuss
the project Communications management
processes there are three project
communication A's management
processes process is carried during
different process groups plan
communication management is done during
planning process group manage
Communications is done during executing
process group and control Communications
is done during monitoring and
controlling process group in the next
few screens we will cover each of these
processes in
detail plan Communications management is
the proc process of developing an
appropriate approach and plan for
project Communications based on
stakeholders information needs and
requirements and available
organizational assets this belongs to
the planning process group stakeholder
register is an important input to this
process it is a list of all the
stakeholders the project management plan
has information about a large number of
the project requirements and the
stakeholders who need to receive
communication of various kinds are
therefore a critical input to this
process in addition to these two
organization process assets and
Enterprise environmental factors are
also inputs to this process many
organizations have standard templates to
prepare communication management plan
which are part of the organizational
process assets and Enterprise
environmental fac s the first technique
used in this process is the
communication requirements analysis
where the communication requirements of
each of the stakeholders are analyzed
and categorized in this you try to find
how many of the stakeholders need
similar kind of information which can be
grouped together if you send information
through an email system all those
stakeholders who need similar
information can be marked in CC in the
email
next you can decide on the communication
technology these days email is the most
widely used technology but in few cases
you might have to send information using
some other technology like fact or
registered post for example all
government Communications are done using
registered post to keep a written record
finally you need to understand how
communication really happens that is the
communication models and the various
communication methods used you may need
to conduct meetings before agreeing on
and finalizing the communications
management plan the communications
management plan is the primary output of
this process which lays down the
procedures around Communications in the
organization communication management
plan has information like which
stakeholder needs what kind of
information at what frequency and how as
a result of this process some other
project documents may also get updated
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the plan Communications
management process so a fair
understanding of the process will help
you answer such questions correctly in
the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer manage
Communications is the process of
creating collecting Distributing storing
retrieving and the ultimate disposition
of project information in accordance to
the communications management plan it
belongs to the executing process group
manage Communications is done throughout
the Project Life Cycle everything cannot
be planned during communication planning
so manage Communications takes care of
responding to unexpected requests for
information as well Communications
management plan is an important input
work performance reports have
information regarding project
performance and Status information
organizational process assets are the
standard templates created for the
status report by organizations in some
organizations there are guidelines for
communication distribution Enterprise
environmental factors are the other
inputs to this process various tools and
techniques are used in this process
Communications tech technology
represents the means of technology that
is email instant messaging telephone
conferencing Etc that are used to
exchange information the use of
communication models helps you determine
the technique that is best suited for a
particular
situation communication methods are the
various methods used to communicate for
example whether it is interactive or
offline whether information is being
pushed by the provider or p hold by the
recipient Etc Information Management
systems help design a framework for
managing the information within a
project that is how it is acquired where
it is stored and how it is distributed
and destroyed in performance reporting
all the information is synthesized in
the form of performance reports that are
later distributed to the appropriate
stakeholders and forms an important part
of the communication strategy on a
project the first and primary output of
this process is the communications
messages that are generated during the
project the other outputs include
project management plan updates project
document updates and organizational
process assets updates in the next
screen let us discuss controll
Communications process control
Communications is the process of
monitoring and controlling
Communications throughout the entire
Project Life Cycle to ensure the
information needs of the project
stakeholders are met it is part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
the inputs to this process are the
project communications project
management plan and issue log which has
a list of issues that are raised by
different project stakeholders data
related to the work being performed on
the project and various other project
documents which may have to be
communicated other inputs include work
performance data and organizational
process assets let us look at the tools
and techniques in detail the information
management systems provide tools to
collect consolidate and present the
information in the form of cogent
concise Communications expertise must be
sought from different stakeholders on
how you should go about this process
several meetings may be needed to ensure
the efficiency and efficacy of the
communications the major outputs of this
process is the work performance
information which indicates that the
work performance data has been analyzed
interpreted and presented in an easily
comprehensible form this process may
also give rise to change requests
updates to the project management plan
project documents and organizational
process Assets in the next screen let us
look into a business scenario to
understand this concept concept better
after reading the problem statement
click the solution button to look at a
possible answer if you are looking to
become a skilled project manager have a
look at the postgraduate program in
project management by simply learn
project risk management includes the
processes of conducting risk management
planning
identification analysis response
planning and controlling risk on a
project it has been mentioned in
practice standard for project risk
management that project risk management
aims to identify and prioritize risks in
advance of their occurrence and provide
action-oriented information to project
managers project risk management is an
integral part of the project management
it provides an approach through which
uncertainty can be understood assessed
and managed within the
projects effective project risk
management is essential for the success
of a
project let us discuss the
interdependencies between project risk
management and project management in the
following screen when you say risk
management is an integral part of
project management it means that they
are dependent on each other the output
of many project management processes can
be considered as an input for risk
management and vice versa for example by
getting the information about the
project progress in terms of schedule
you realize that it is not in line with
the expected progress which can become a
risk for the project so risk management
plays an important role to decide what
response must be given or what actions
are to be taken similarly based on the
response of risk management the project
management plan with respect to the
deliverable will change as you already
know all the projects have uncertainty
project management can be seen as an
attempt to control this uncertain
environment through the use of
structured techniques like estimating
planning cost control activity
allocation earned value analysis
monitoring and review meetings project
risk management provides an approach by
which uncertainty can be understood
assessed and managed within projects
so effective project management is a
critical success factor for project
success let us continue this discussion
on Project risk management and project
management in the next screen the
management or project manager should not
look at project risk management as an
optional activity or overhead the
interface between project risk
management and other processes of
project management must be cleared to
address the
uncertainty the outputs of project risk
management should be considered within
the project management
processes they can impact various
aspects like estimating resources cost
or
duration assessing the impact of scope
changes resource allocation and project
progress reports to the
stakeholders the effectiveness of
project management process is in
increased by using the information and
results from Project risk management on
the other hand some of the outputs of
other project management processes such
as work breakdown structure
WBS estimation of schedule and cost and
assumptions are important prerequisites
for project risk management let us first
discuss how we can make risk management
process effective in the next screen you
make risk management more successful
effective or consistent by using
processes methodologies or a set of
activities however before using these
processes you should keep some points in
mind riskmanagement process should be
scalable to meet different elements like
available resources methodology and
processes used tools and techniques used
supporting infrastructure review and
update frequency
and Reporting
requirements it is important to have a
clear understanding of the risk
threshold that defines the views of key
stakeholders on acceptable levels of
risk it is equally important to identify
the framework to manage the risk
starting from the initiation stage to
its successful
implementation project risk management
activities resources and attention
should be appropriated to the project
since different projects warrant
different levels of risk management
application some of the actions required
for tailoring are defining objectives
against which risks will be
identified defining how the elements
like resources methodologies tools
infrastructure and communication are
scalable for the project and defining
risk thresholds tolerances and the
assessment of framework work the outputs
should be documented communicated
reviewed to ensure common understanding
of the scope and objectives for the
project risk management processes in
this screen we will look into the
highlevel activities carried out in the
six project risk management
processes the first process is plan risk
management in this process you define
the scope and objectives of the project
project risk management
processes the key output of this process
is the project riskmanagement
plan the second process is identify
risks in this process you identify
maximum possible known risks you will be
focusing on the tools and techniques
used in the process of identifying
risks the key output is the risk
register the third process is perform
qualitative risk
analysis this process is about
prioritizing risks and ranking them as
high medium and low for further
action the focus will be on tools used
to prioritize
risks the fourth process is perform
quantitative risk
analysis in this process you evaluate
the combined effect of risks on the
overall project outcome the risks are
Quantified
numerically the fifth process is plan
risk
responses this process helps us
determine appropriate response
strategies and actions for each
individual risk and for overall project
risk and integrates them into overall
project management plan the sixth and
last process is control
risks this process focuses on
implementing risk response plans
tracking identified risks monitoring
residual risks identifying new risks and
evaluating risk process Effectiveness
throughout the project in the next
screen we will look into the flow of all
these six processes and how it works
logically there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to five
process groups in this lesson we will
look at the 10th knowledge area that is
Project stakeholder management and its
processes in the next screen let us
understand who stakeholders are a
stakeholder is anybody who has a stake
in the project a stakeholder may be an
individual a group or an organization
who may affect or be affected by or
perceive to be affected by a decision
activity or outcome of a project further
the nature of the impact can be positive
or negative thus giving to the notion of
positive or negative stakeholders
irrespective of whether a stakeholder is
positive or negative it is important to
engage with the stakeholders and get
them involved in the project this can
make a critical difference to the
success or failure of the project a
single disgruntled stakeholder can bring
the entire project to its knees whereas
an actively engaged and influential
stakeholder can have the opposite effect
let us understand who the common
stakeholders of a project are there are
several categorizations of stakeholders
the project managers themselves are
important stakeholders the project team
members represent stakeholders in the
project the Senior Management of the
organization which is working on the
project has a stake in the project the
sponsor that is the person or entity
that provides the money and resources
for the project and essentially
Champions the project is an important
stakeholder the customer which may be
different from the sponsor is a
stakeholder as well for instance in many
of the projects in the social sector the
sponsor may be the government or a
development agency whereas the customers
would be the people who actually benefit
from it the end users which may be
different from the customers or the
sponsors are stakeholders too the
vendors or suppliers who provide goods
or services to the project are important
stakeholders people whose lives may be
impacted by the output of the project
are also stakeholders for example if a
highway project requires possession of
privately owned land people whose land
is being taken away are the stakeholders
if the construction of a dam or water
reservoir benefits the downstream
farming communities they are the
stakeholders here competitors who
provide alternative goods or services
are stakeholders too sometimes
environmentalists or other social groups
may become stakeholders the government
or political iCal leadership may become
stakeholders for projects in the public
domain it is sufficient to state that
there could potentially be hundreds of
stakeholders for a large project it is
in the interest of the project manager
and the project team to clearly identify
all such stakeholders upfront and then
actively manage them throughout the
project in the next screen let us
discuss the classification models for
stakeholder
analysis not all the stakeholders have
the same amount of influence or power
over the project therefore the way to
manage each stakeholder needs to be
calibrated based on a proper
classification of the stakeholders this
is the role of the classification model
you can come up with a grid that Maps
the power of the stakeholders the
interest they have the influence they
may have or the impact that they can
have on the project through the power
interest power influence or influence
impact grids it can be represented by
mapping stakeholders to a power or
interest grid the diagram on the screen
has X AIS which represents interest
level and y axis which represents the
power level based on the various
combinations of power levels and
interest levels the grid can be divided
into four quadrants the stakeholders on
the top right quadrant with high power
and high interest need to be managed
closely that is you have to monitor
their involvement and engagement very
closely the stakeholders on on the
bottom right quadrant with high interest
but low power need to be kept in the
loop that is you should share
information with them and keep them
regularly informed the stakeholders on
the top left quadrant with high power
but low interest can be managed by
keeping them happy for example by making
sure that their interests and opinions
are taken into consideration the
stakeholders on the left bottom quadrant
with low power and low interest may be
managed less actively by simply
monitoring how things are going with
them the salience model describes
classes of stakeholders based on their
power ability to impose their will
urgency need for immediate attention and
legitimacy appropriateness of their
involvement level this is a useful
framework to guide the stakeholder
management strategy on a project
practice creating power grids for
business scenarios this will help in
understanding the level of Engagement a
project manager needs to maintain with
various stakeholders
in the next screen let us discuss the
stakeholder engagement assessment Matrix
the stakeholder engagement assessment
Matrix allows visualizing the current
and desired states of a stakeholder's
involvement in the project the five
levels of involvement are as unaware
resistant neutral supportive and leading
unaware is where the stakeholder is not
aware of the project or its impact
resistant is where the stakeholder is
aware of the impact acts and is
resistant to change neutral is where the
stakeholder is aware of the project and
is neither supportive nor in opposition
to the project supportive is where the
stakeholder is aware of the project and
its impact and is supportive of the
change leading is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and impacts and
is actively engaged to ensure that the
project is
successful let us now look at the Matrix
the table has one row per stakeholder
identified you place C in the column
which best indicates the current level
of Engagement for that stakeholder then
you place D in the column which best
indicates the desired state of
Engagement this table can be a quick
visualization tool that helps understand
where work has to be done in the
stakeholder management activities in the
next screen let us discuss the skills
required for stakeholder
management stakeholder management is
both an art and a science
since it involves dealing with people
and people are inherently nonlinear and
unpredictable there is no one size that
fits all strategies or tools that will
work while managing them however a
project manager may use a few traits and
techniques while managing stakeholders
which are classified as interpersonal
skills and managerial skills a project
manager must possess good interpersonal
skills that is must invest the time and
energy to build trust this involves
multiple things such as establishing a
personal Rapport following through on
commitments being punctual Etc once the
trust is established it helps in
smoothing many difficult bends conflict
management is an important skill for a
project manager while communicating with
stakeholders the project manager must
practice active listening they must not
assume that they have all the
answers instead they should spend some
time to understand the issues and the
stakeholders points of view this alone
can go a long way in smoothing ruffled
feathers and building constructive
relationships resistance to change is
natural a project manager must know how
to convert that into a positive energy
in its favor managerial skills that may
help in accomplishing the project
objectives a project manager must be
able to build consensus among the group
while absolute uniformity may not always
be possible or desire able the project
manager must use techniques to ensure
widespread discussions and arrive at a
path that the group can buy into the
project manager must be able to
influence people often without
necessarily being in the position of
authority the project manager must be
skillful to negotiate agreements the
project manager must be able to
understand and modify organizational
behavior in order to move the project in
a certain direction earned value
technique is an excellent way to track
the project progress against the project
plan it is a method of measuring the
project performance objectively and
comparing it against the project
Baseline results from an earned value
analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule
baselines Baseline is the initial
approved value along with approved
changes therefore schedule Baseline is
the first approved project schedule
along with approve D changes there are
various terms used in earned value
technique planned value is the
authorized budget assigned to the
scheduled work earned value is the work
performed in terms of budget authorized
for that work actual cost is the cost
incurred in work performed budget at
completion is the budgeted amount for
the total work estimate at completion is
the expected total cost for the project
estimate to complete is the expected
cost to finish all the remaining Project
work variance at completion is the
projected budget surplus or deficit at
the end of the project all the
parameters displayed on the screen are
measured in terms of cost you may come
across business scenario based questions
on earned value Management in the PMP
exam so ensure that you develop a clear
understanding of this topic let us look
at an example of a planned value in the
next screen planned value is the
estimated value of the work planned this
value is measured in terms of currency
say dollar if the plan value is
$340 then the work plan is worth
$340 how do you calculate earned value
the solution is add the budget allocated
to each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value in
the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned
value in cost variance negative means
the project is over budget positive
means the project is under budget
similarly in schedule variant negative
means the project is behind schedule
whereas positive means the project is
ahead of schedule the value of the next
two parameters cost performance index
CPI and schedule performance index SPI
values vary between zero and and one for
example a CPI of 0.8 implies that 80
cents of work is obtained for every
dollar spent in the project similarly if
SPI is
0.9 it implies that project is
progressing at only 90% of the speed
originally planned the next parameter is
estimate at completion or
EAC there are different ways of
calculating the EAC value the method
used depends on how the cost and
schedule variances are expected to play
for the rest of the project BAC by CPI
is used if you expect that the current
cost performance will continue until the
end of the project AC plus BAC minus EV
is used if you expect that the rest of
the project will be managed at the
budgeted rate AC plus BAC minus EV by
the product of CPI and SPI is used if
you want to factor in the impact of the
cost as well as schedule
variances AC plus Etc is used if you
want to re-evaluate the Project based on
a forecast value for the estimated cost
of the remainder of the project the next
parameter is estimate to complete or Etc
which is the cost of project from this
point to the end this is calculated by
subtracting the actual cost from the
estimate at completion in addition
variance at completion can be calculated
by subtracting the estimate at
completion from the budget at completion
variance at completion is the cost
estimation whether it is over or under
budget another parameter is the to
complete performance index or
tcpi this is the cost performance needed
to achieve a desired
outcome for example if the project needs
to be managed to the original budget BAC
then tcpi
that is the CPI that must be maintained
for the rest of the project is
calculated as BAC minus EV by BAC minus
AC similarly if it has to be managed
within a revised Target say EAC then
tcpi is calculated as BAC minus EV by
EAC minus AC before the start of the PMP
exam please make a note of the formulas
of earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer let us take
the example of a software development
project there are four phases and each
phase takes a month to complete and is
expected to cost
$10,000 the phases are planned to be
completed one after the other the status
of the project at the end of the month
three is summarized in the
table requirements definition is
completed and actual spending on this is
$10,000 architecture and design is done
and actual spending on this is
$112,000 development and unit testing is
only 50% done though it was supposed to
be completed by Third month it has cost
$99,000 until date system testing and go
live has not yet started note as s
indicates start time F indicates finish
time and PF indicates that it is partly
finished at the end of the month based
on the above information calculate the
CV SV CPI and SPI of the project let us
look at a solution in the next
screen before we end this lesson let us
also look at a few definitions that
might be useful for your PMP
examination law of diminishing return
this means the more you put into
something the less you get out of it for
example doubling the number of resources
working on a project will not
necessarily have the time working
capital the amount of money the company
has to invest on the project and the
day-to-day company operations funding
limit reconciliation the process of
comparing the planned expenditure in a
given period with the available funding
for that period large assets purchased
by the company lose value over time this
is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight line and
accelerated same amount of depreciation
is taken every year for instance a car
with a price tag of $10,000 and useful
life of 10 years is depreciated $1,000
per year at the end of the 10th year the
value of the car is considered zero for
all accounting purposes accelerated
depreciation depreciates faster than the
straight line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of $10,000
depreciates $3,000 the first year $1,500
the next year 1,000 the third year and
so on so first let's find out what
exactly is
CPN now the critical part method is an
algorithm that's used in project
management to schedule project
activities now one of the biggest
advantages of CPM is that it gives you a
model you create a model through which
you can determine the different tasks
that are required to complete the
project the dependencies between these
tasks and the duration required to
complete a particular
activity the critical path is the
longest stretch of activities and the
measure of them from start to finish now
to understand the critical path method
there are certain things that you need
to know so let's have a look at a
completed critical path method diagram
or a network
diagram so so this is somewhat what a
final version should look
like so here you can see see these
circles with numbers in them we'll also
need
c so let's talk about what this is so
the two major components in a diagram a
network diagram are events and
activities so as you can see here a
circle the circle with the number in
between it represents a particular
particular event this is present at the
start and end of an
activity so
here A B CDE e f represent
activities and each activity like I
mentioned has a start and an end
node so for activity a this node node
number one is called the tail
node and event two or no two is known as
the head node likewise each of these
activities have a different tail and
head node there are also other things
that you need to know before you can
start drawing your own network diagram
the network that you create should have
a unique starting node here you can see
it there's only one starting node one
unique starting node which is node
number one there's no multiple nodes
starting off the network then the
network should have a unique completion
node which is node number six
here there's only a single node which
completes the entire
network no activity should be
represented by more than one Arc in the
network which means that this arrow that
you see this represents an arc there's
only one activity responding to an arc
this means that no two activities can
have the same starting node as well as
ending node and finally there's this
thing known as a dummy activity which is
represented by dotted lines between two
nodes say for example four and
three so this dummy activity represents
a relationship between node 4 and node 3
but at the same time there's no duration
or there's no activity and if there is
that activity will have zero value
unlike every other activity that you see
in the network so this is the basics of
the critical path method let's
understand this better with an example
our objective here is to determine the
critical path of this data represented
here now here you can see let's have a
look at each of these different columns
we have activity immediate predecessor
and duration now the duration let's
assume is in
months let's write that
down all right so now let's have a look
at activity and immediate predecessor
because that's what's currently
important so here we have activity a who
does not have any immediate predecessor
similarly activities B and C don't have
immediate predecessors as well so first
let's draw activity a so since it does
not have an immediate predecessor it'll
have a node of its own connecting to it
so first let's draw node number
one this is node number two let connect
them
both here we write down the activity
connecting them and the duration which
is
three likewise let's have a look at
activity B it also does not have an
immediate predecessor let's see which
other activities have b as its immediate
pressor we have activity d as well as
activity G so let's draw that
too it's node
three B
4 months
duration next up we have activity c c
also does not have an immediate
predecessor but it also acts as an
immediate predecessor for activities H
and I let's draw a note for
activity
C four let's write down the duration
which is
six now let's have a look at activity D
now D is preceded by activity B however
a combination of c and d act as
immediate predecessors for H and I which
means that C and D will have a common
point of origin just right here so let's
connect node 3 and node
4 this
represents the activity d
which is three mons now let's have a
look at activity e which is preceded by
activity a so now let's have a look at
activity e the immediate predecessor for
activity e is a so we can directly draw
that and as you can see here there's no
combination of different activities here
so we can draw you
directly so let's draw the
bo go
next
note E which is
N9 right then now let's go to f f is
preceded by a but at the same time let's
have a look at where f is used f is
also an immediate predecessor of K which
is a combination of f g h so let's come
back to F in a bit let's go to G G so as
of now we've completed a b c d and e
let's skip f for now and go to G G is
preceded by B at the same time it is
used as a combination of fgh which means
G can come
here is
oh so G is complete now there's only F
left now H H is a combination of both CP
which means its origin Point comes from
here so whose origin point is the node
4 both H and I originate from the node
four so as we can notice here f g and H
both act as immediate predecessors for K
and L which means at some point they all
need to unite this is exactly here at
node number
six so let's
combine H and
G it has a duration of
five so let's now go back to F now F we
can combine to node number 6 since we
know that f g and H come together at
some point so let's combine F to this
node
there you
go f with the
duration of
one now we're done with node number six
or we're also done with h now for
activity I Now activity I is preceded by
CD I also access predecessor for m so
it's an independent activity so let's
add that searly
here proceeding Four's connect
that I mean node 7 with
I which is
four
right I is
complete let's go to J J is preceded by
E
here and is is only used as combination
for n in the end
so at some point J and K need to combine
as you can see here l m andn don't act
as immediate predecessors which means
they represent final nodes or they
connect to the final node as you found
out earlier which is one of the rules
when you're creating a network for
yourself so let's draw k k and l are
both preceded by FG and H but we also
know that for n j and k
connect with each other which means we
can draw
J
here finish J and since J and K together
connect towards n we can also assume the
K goes from here note
68 right K which has a d
six now for L now L is preceded by
fgh but it is not an immediate
predecessor for any other item which
means that it connects to the final node
right
here that would be node
9 L which duration is
three so now we have M and N left m is
preceded by I so let's draw
that and N is preceded by J and
K this is n
N9 and
N 6 so now the network is complete and
now let's find out how to create the
critical path so to understand the
critical path or to determine the
critical path you need two parts the
earliest start times and the latest
completion times which are both
represented by
es and LC now the earliest start time
refers to the earliest starting times of
each note likewise for latest completion
time so each node has its own earliest
start time and latest completion time
they're represented in the box so we
create
boxes for each of these nodes
there you go each of these boxes need to
be
divided so in these boxes the lower half
represents the earliest start time and
the upper half represents the latest
completion time so first off we'll find
out the earliest start time so the
process finding the earliest star time
is referred to as forward pass now the
earliest star time can be determined
with the formula so the formula
is start
time of the end
mode to the max
early starting time of the starting
mod plus the distance between
them so let's see what we mean
here so one thing you need to know is
that the early starting time of node one
is always zero so let's write that down
in a different
color it's always zero so let's have a
look at the early start time for node
number
two so the early start time when it
comes to the previous node which is node
number one is
zero plus the distance which is
three which means the early start time
for node number two is three write that
down let's have a look at node number
three here the earliest start time for
node number three 0 is the earliest
start time of the previous node plus 4
which is the distance which equals
four let's put that down
here that's
Co so now let's have a look at node
number four so here however there's a
difference since there are two nodes
coming towards it which is from 1 to 4
and from 3 to 4 we need to determine the
maximum from both of these coming notes
so for the early starting time for no
number four
it's
either 0 + 6 which is C
here 6
or 4 + 3 which is B +
d s so here considering that we taking
the maximum of both we'll have to choose
seven which we write down
here I hope you guys understood how we
did that which is basically we took the
maximum of both the values that are
coming towards the node number four
likewise we'll have a look at some of
the other ones that are coming soon so
let's have a look so here we have a
similar isue for node number six so for
node number six we have three points
coming towards node there f g and H
so which of the following is the least
let's find out so here 3 + 1 is
4 e is 5 ear start time node number
six would
be it's either 3 + 1
4
or 4 + 4
8
or 7 + 5 12
so since we're taking the maximum let's
take number 12 and write that down so
the earliest start time for the node 6
is 12 likewise let's have a look at node
number five since there are no different
nodes connected to it we'll just have to
add the number from the previous
starting node which is three and the
distance which is
N9 we combine to form 12 let's trite
that down now for node number eight so
when you have look at node number eight
you can see that there are two nodes
connected to it there's one from five
and one from
six so let's have a look which one we'll
select so it's either 12 + 3 which is 15
or 12 + 6 which is
18 so let's go ahead with number 18 so
the earli starting time for this node is
18 so let's have a look at node number
seven so since there are no other
different nodes connect connected to it
we can directly go with s which is the
ear starting time of the previous node
plus the distance which is
4 this is totaling to
11 and finally we have node number nine
so nine has three different points
connecting to it which is 18 + 9 12 + 3
11 + 6 you can see here 18 + 9 12 + 3 11
+ 6 as you can see the winner is the
maximum which which is from node 8 which
is
27 and like that we've completed the
forward pass which we have determined
the earliest starting time of each of
these nodes now let's have a look at the
latest completion time for this we'll
start from node number nine and work our
way back to node number
one so for latest completion time of the
last node is always equal to the
earliest starting time which means that
here latest completion time of this mode
is
27 now the formula for latest completion
time is latest completion time of
previous node is equal
minimum latest completion time of
the head node
minus minus the distance between them so
let's see what we're talking about let's
go to node number eight so basically
when there are multiple connections
shooting out of a particular node we
need to decide a number of different
options in this case node 8 is directly
connected to node 9 basically we can
calculate the latest completion time for
node 8 by using the formula directly
which is
27 -
9 which will get 18 so let's that here
the latest completion time for node 8 is
18 let's have a look at number seven
here again we have a direct connection
between node 7 and node 99 so therefore
we can find latest completion time for
node 7 by directly applying it with the
formula which is 27 -
6 which is 21 so let's write that
down let's go node number six here there
are two points extending out of node six
which means we'll need to choose from
two here we
have 27 - 3 which is 2 4 or 18 - 6 which
is 12 now we need to choose the minimum
of the both so let's go with 12 let's
write that
down so the latest completion time for
node 6 is 12 now let's go to node number
five so for node number five for node
number five the latest completion time
will be since we're directly connected
to node number 8 18 - 3 which is 15
let's write that down let's go to node
number four which has two points
connecting out of it h and I to to node
6 and 7even so let's choose among the
two so for node number four it'll be
either 12 - 5 which is
7 or 21 - 4 which is
17 so which one should we choose the
minimum which means the connection
towards node six the correct answer
which is 7 12 - 5
7 now for node number
three so node number three has two
points shooting out of it so we need to
choose from either the connection to
node six or node
4 for node 6 is 12 - 4 which is 8 or
it's from node number four which is 7 -
3 which is 4 hence we'll take the
connection from node number four so
let's take the latest completion time of
node number three as
four now for node number number two so
since there are two connections coming
out of it we'll need to choose between
the connection to node 5 or the
connection to node 6 so for node six we
can directly conclude that choosing the
node number six would be a bad idea
because the final answer would be 12 - 1
which is 11 or it could be 15 - 9 which
is 6 clearly the answer is six since we
taken the minimum of
the and finally we've come to node
number one
so here the final
answer it's either a b or c which is
node 2 3 or four so for node two we have
6 - 3 which is 3 for node 3 we have 4 -
4 which is 0o and for node four we have
7 - 6 which is 1 clearly we have a
winner which is node number three let's
write the latest completion time it's
zero and there we go the backward pass
is now compl
complete so how do we now find the
critical path the critical path can be
determined with the help of satisfying
certain conditions let's have a look at
what they are so to determine the
critical path we need to satisfy three
conditions they are the earliest
starting time and the latest completion
time need to be equal similarly for the
head node the earliest starting time and
the latest completion time also have to
be same and finally
start
time the earliest start time of the
second node which is the head node minus
the earli starting time of the tail node
should be equal to the latest completion
time of the head node minus the latest
completion time of the tail Lo they
should also be equal to the distance
between the two loads so let's have a
look at which of the following satisfy
these condition as you can see See
Clearly node number one node number
three node number four node number six
node number eight and node number nine
so all of these nodes I mentioned
satisfy these two
criteria let's have a look at if it
satisfies the third criteria here we
have 4 - 0 which is 4 4 - 0 which is 4
we have the correct answer 7 - 4 which
is three similarly 7 - 4 which is 3 12 -
7 which is 5 likewise all of them
connect which means we have just found
out our critical path the critical path
for this question
is
b
d
h
K and
N critical path is
b b
h n and thanks to the help of the
critical path we can also determine the
maximum amount of time to complete our
project which we can determine by
combining the durations of each of the
members of the critical path which is
4+
3 +
5 + 6 + 9
is equal to 27 which means 27
months and there you go we have just
solved a question with the critical path
method agile project management as a
name suggests is a flexible approach to
building a project in agile project
management the project is broken down
into several stages or Sprints agile
does not work on the principle of
delivering the final product at the end
of the project it works on delivering
sections of a project or mini projects
the process of project management in the
case of a is agile based so there won't
be any central control of project
manager as it was there in the
traditional way of working before we
move forth let's have a look at the
Agile development cycle agile
methodologies consist of several small
Cycles or Sprints at the end of each
stage we get a mini project there's a
product backlog that explains new
features changes in the existing
features and several other improvements
in the project then we have a Sprint
backlog which has a list of tasks that
are to be completed during each Sprint
the Sprint consists of planning
designing execution testing and
deployment stages and at the end of each
Sprint a mini project is delivered with
every Sprint new features are added to
the product which plays a significant
role in the overall project growth after
all the Sprints and early validation in
the development the final deliverable
has a fewer chances of failure let's now
have a look at some reasons why
Industries have started moving towards
agile project management the first
reason is high product quality when we
talk about high product quality we refer
to the build of the product as per
stakeholders demands testing is
performed at Short intervals of time
wherever needed to ensure high quality
of the product then another reason is
customer satisfaction whatever is done
in the project is known by the customer
the deliveries don't take longer
durations as they used to take in the
case of traditional ways the changes may
be provided by the customer in the
execution phase of the project third
reason is reduced risk since the project
is divided into Sprints so if the risk
effects one Sprint it doesn't mean whole
of the project will be at risk the
process of risk analysis continues to
take place with all the other processes
another significant reason for agile
project management is better and faster
return on investment the project is now
developed in several Sprints and each
Sprint has its own version therefore the
project becomes Market ready after a few
Sprints only since the projects can now
be released with ease and in shorter
duration this helps the organization to
stay ahead in competition with respect
to other organizations which have still
not moved to Agile methodology now we
shall check the principles of agile
project management there are 10
principles for successful agile project
management the first principle is the
satisfaction of the customer by
delivering the project fast and with
least number of Errors the next
principle refers to decreasing the
amount of time between the phase of
planning and delivery the third
principle states that the team of
managers and developers work together
and increase the productivity of their
work work the next principle states that
the changes requested by the
stakeholders can be taken into
consideration and worked upon during the
development phase as well the fifth
principle pays attention to the factor
of coordination among the team members
then the sixth principle refers to the
process of monitoring and tracking the
progress of the project at the end of
each Sprint and making amendments
wherever needed moving on the next
principal states that there must be a
feeling of trust and support towards the
team to complete the Project's objective
Ives the next principle emphasizes on
face-to-face conversations with the
development team the face-to-face
conversation helps in both solving
problems and easy knowledge sharing then
the ninth principle emphasizes on
finding Solutions and maximizing the
amount of work done with Simplicity this
ensures timely completion of tasks by
all the team members the last principle
states that scrum tools like monday.com
or Zoho Sprints must be used to simplify
the complicated codes which further
helps in saving time we shall now see
the steps in agile project management
the goal of agile methodology is to
produce shorter development life cycles
and more frequent product releases than
traditional waterfall project management
so we will now check six steps in agile
project methodology the first step in
the process is Project planning project
planning includes feasibility study
development of scope breaking the
project into executable tasks or Sprints
and then estimating the amount of time
needed to complete those Sprints the
second step is the step of road map
creation a road map is a plan of action
that shows how a project shall evolve
over time a list of all the features
that the final product should have is
created and the steps to achieve those
features are taken the next important
step is release planning since we are
doing the project keeping in mind the
agile project methodology the project
will complete in Sprints that means
there will be the release of features at
the end of each cycle and unlike the
traditional waterfall model the
development Cycles will be smaller
follow the fourth step in agile project
management is Sprint planning the
Sprints are made keeping in mind what
all is to be accomplished in that
particular Step At the beginning of each
Sprint the goal of that Sprint is
decided and steps to achieve that goal
are taken the next step in the process
emphasizes on daily meetings there are
short meetings every day to discuss if
the team was able to finish the task for
each Sprint and check if there are any
amendments that are required each team
member talks about what they achieved in
the last Sprint and what are they going
to work on in the next Sprint the last
step is the step of Sprint review and
retrospective there are two meetings
after each Sprint first meeting is for
the Sprint review this meeting is with
the stakeholders to show them the
finished product this helps both sides
to build a relationship and discuss if
there are any issues in the end product
the second meeting is for having a
Sprint retrospective this meeting
involves the stakeholders to discuss
what went well and what went wrong
during the Sprint Sprint retrospective
takes place after the Sprint review and
before the next Sprint planning now when
we know the steps needed for agile
project methodology we must understand
some agile project management Frameworks
there are several Frameworks available
today here we will be discussing some of
the most popular Frameworks the first
framework we will discuss is the canbin
framework canbin framework is a
well-known framework for implementing
agile software development in the case
of canbin framework work items are
represented on the canman board which
helps all the team members to see the
state of every piece of work at any time
canman board not only helps in
visualizing the work but also optimizing
the workflow among the team the next
framework we will discuss today is the
scrum framework scrum framework is a
popular framework for managing complex
knowledge work like in the field of
research and Advanced Technologies scrum
is a simple framework that helps team
work together and learn through their
EXP experiences gained while working on
a problem the third framework we will
see today is the hybrid framework the
hybrid framework is a combination of
agile methodology and non-agile
methodology in the case of a hybrid
framework planning is done using the
traditional way of project management
while the execution and delivery is done
using the agile methodology since the
hybrid is a combination of the two it
handles the requirement changes and
delivers the product in different stages
the fourth and the last framework we
will see is the lean framework the lean
framework works on the principle of
providing maximum customer value and
creating zero waste it focuses on
optimizing the flow of products all
through the value stream this helps in
eliminating waste all through the
process and create processes that
requires less human efforts this also
simplifies the process of information
management and makes it more accurate
finally let's have a look at some
companies that have opted for agile
project management today around 22% of
the organizations worldwide have all
their teams working on the principle of
agile project methodology let's have a
look at some of the most prominent
companies in the world that use agile
project management in the list we have
IBM Cisco AT&T Microsoft Phillips and
Samsung so what is project management
tools why should we use project
management tools while doing project
management so project management tools
help to keep a streamlining flow in
project management AG processes the
tools help the team or an individual to
carry out the steps of project
management in an effective and efficient
manner so project management tools
features and functionalities so
basically a project management tool
should have minimum fulfilling these
features and functionality they should
be simple to use customizable they
should have API for integration it
should help in collaboration it should
help in Risk analysis and real-time
reporting when we say simple to use the
project management tools need to be
suitable for every project we do one
needs to find a tool that will have a
pleasant interface and increase work
productivity the project management tool
must be easy to configure according to
the organization needs every project
management approach every project
management templates every artifact
needs tailoring and adaption before
adopting as part of the practice there
are business patterns that change every
day so having customizable tool is an
added Advantage API or application
programming interface enables the
sharing of data and application between
devices the tools with API integration
allow seamless connectivity amongst the
team the project management tools must
allow for collaboration so that whole
team can work together collaboration not
only makes the task easier but also
increases the productivity of the
project risk analysis helps to identify
analyze and respond to the risk quickly
and efficiently it needs to capture all
the details of the risks their impacts
the probability of occurrence of the
risk and risk responses and tracking
them throughout the Project Life Cycle
the realtime reporting enables the
access of data at different locations of
the project management one can assess or
Access Data at any time about the
Project's current status this will help
in having a real-time update about the
project status to the stakeholders of
the project the top 10 project
management tools what we have today in
the market are monday.com Rick jira

kinds of information like what's being
worked on who's working on what and what
progress the project is making so guys
before we move on let us discuss our
agenda for today's session so we are
going to begin our session with
understanding the project management
moving ahead we are going to discuss
about project management activities in
software development then we're going to
have a deep discussion on five variables
in project control moving ahead we are
also going to discuss about phases or
tasks involved in software engineering
projects and at the end we are going to
conclude our session with discussion on
benefits of using phases in project so
guys let us start with understanding the
project management so guys project
management is a discipline of defining
and achieving targets while optimizing
the use of resources like time money
people materials energy space Etc over
the course of project which means a set
of activities of finite
duration that's the actual definition of
project management and with that I hope
so you have got a brief idea regarding
what exactly is project
management now we going to move forward
and try to understand what are the
project management activities involved
in software engineering so guys project
management activities encompasses wide
range of tasks aimed at ensuring that
software projects are completed
successfully these activities are
generally grubbed into the following
phases the first one is initiation in
this phase it includes project Charter
development where you have to create a
formal document that outlines the
project objectives stakeholders and
initial scope then it includes the
stakeholders identification where you
have to recognize all the parties
affected by the project and understand
their needs and expectations
afterm we have the next phase which is
the planning it includes scope where you
have to clearly Define what is and what
is not included in the project under its
umbrella next comes the scheduling part
where you have to create a detailed
project timeline including milestones
and
deliverable moving ahead we have the
resource planning in this domain where
you have to determine what resources
means the people tools materials are
needed and it also includes the
budgeting where you have to estimate the
cost of project and planning for the
budget next comes the risk management so
under the planning we have the risk
management planning where you have to
identify potential risk and developing
mitigation strategies and finally have
under its umbrella the communication
planning where you have to establish how
information will be communicated among
the
stakeholders the third phase that we are
going to study about is known as
execution so guys it includes team
formation developments which mean
assembling the project team and
fostering team development then comes
task assignment where you have to assign
tasks to team members based on their
skills and project
requirements next come under it is a
quality assurance where you have to
implement the processes to ensure that
software meets the required standards
next comes under it is stakeholder
engagement where you have to keep St
stakeholders informed and involved
throughout the project moving ahead we
have the fourth phase that is monitoring
and
controlling so guys progress tracking
where you have to regularly monitor
Project's progress against the
plan under it we have the performance
reporting where you have to provide
updates on the project status including
any issues or risk under it we have the
next that is change management where you
have to manage the changes in the
project scope
schedule and resources then we have the
quality control under this and it
includes conducting regular checks and
testing to ensure deliverables meet the
required quality standards and finally
we have the monitoring part where it
means keeping an eye on the identified
risk and looking out for new risk and
finally we move to our last phase that
is the closure so guys closure includes
the final deliverables where you have to
complete and deliver the final product
to the client moving ahead we have the
project documentation under its part
where you have to compile all the
project documents for future reference
then you have to do the post project
review where you have to conduct a
review to identify Lessons Learned and
areas or Improvement then we have the
stakeholder satisfaction where you have
to ensure all the stakeholders are
satisfied with the project outcomes and
finally you have release under this
umbrella where you have to release
project team members to their next
assignments
so Guys these activities help structure
the work of project managers and teams
ensuring that software projects are
completed efficiently and effectively
with clear documentation and
communication at every
stage now let us move on and discuss
about five variables of project control
in software
engineering project control in software
engineering revolves around monitoring
and managing key variables to ensure
that the project stays on tracks these
variable include the five variables of
project control and software engineering
ffic project control in software
engineering involves monitoring and
managing key variables to ensure project
stays on track and meets its objective
so let us delve into these five crucial
variable the first one that we have is
schope so guys a scope encompasses all
the work required to deliver a product
service or Reserve bu with the specified
features and functions it's essentially
the project boundaries and deliverables
it includes two parameters that is
controls and tools if we talk about
control it means that to maintain
control over the scope it's vital to
ensure that the project remains within
the agreed upon boundaries this involves
managing any changes through a formal
Change Control process to prevent scope
creep which can derail the project by
introducing unplanned task next we have
on this umbrella the tools used so the
common tools for scope control includes
the work breakdown structure which
breaks the project into manageable
sections and requirements documentation
to outline what needs to be done and
change request from to manage and
approve any alterations to the project
scope next we have all over here is time
time refers to the project schedule
which includes the start and the end
dates key milestones and deadlines it's
about when things need to happen if you
talk about control guys it means keeping
the project on schedule it requires
regular monitoring of progress against
timeline adjustments to the schedule
might be necessary to address delays or
to accelerate certain tasks if needed
here tools used are such as scan charts
provide a visual timeline of project
activities project schedules lays out
the sequence and timing of task critical
path analysis identifies the longest
sequence of task that must be completed
on time for the project to finish on
schedule and project management
softwares used are like jira Microsoft
Project which helps in planning
executing monitoring and scheduling now
let us move to the third part that is
cost cost involves the budget allocated
for the project covering all the
expenses such as labor materials
equipments and overhead if you talk
about the control parameter in this it
includes tracking project expenditures
against budget and making adjustments as
necessary this might involve
implementing the cost saving measures or
managing changes to the budget here
tools used are cost estimation models
which helps to predict expenses budget
tracking spreadsheets and provide a way
to monitor costs and earned value
management which also integrates project
scope cost and schedule measures to help
assess the project performance and
progress the fourth one that we going to
talk about is Quality quality refers to
the degree to which the project
deliverables meet the required standards
and satisfy the customer needs it's
about delivering a product that performs
as expected as the meets of stakeholders
and
expectations it involves adhering to the
established quality standards through
systematic testing reviews and
inspections we have to also address any
defects or issues promptly which is very
crucial for maintaining the quality
tools used are such as quality assurance
plans which outlines the activities
required to ensure quality testing
Frameworks which provide a structure for
systematic testing inspection checklist
which helps in verifying that all the
quality requirements are met and quality
control charts also monitor quality
performance and finally we move to our
last that is the risk risk incompasses
the potential events or conditions that
could negatively impact the project this
could range from from technical failures
to Resource shortages effective risk
controls involves identifying analyzing
and prioritizing risk developing and
implementing mitigation strategies is
very very crucial to manage these risk
proactively if we talk about tools for
risk control it includes risk registers
to document and track risk risk
assessment matrices helps to evaluate
the S variety and likelihood of risk we
also do the swort analysis to identify
strengths weaknesses and opportunities
and also threats and contingency plans
to outline steps to take if risk
materializes so guys by keeping a firm
grip on these five variables like scope
time cost quality and risk project
managers can navigate the complexities
of software engineering projects and
drive them to successful completion now
since we have got a brief idea regarding
what are the variables in project
control let us move to our next task
where we are going to discuss the phases
or task which are are involved in
software engineering projects in
software engineering managing project
often involves breaking down into
manageable phases or task this
structured approach ensures Clarity
organization and control throughout the
Project Life Cycle each phase is
characterized by specific criteria and
deliverables which play a crucial role
in project success the first one that we
are going to discuss is about entry
criteria entry criteria are the
conditions that must be met before a
phase or task can begin in software
engineering entry criteria ensures that
all necessary preparation and
prerequisites are completed before the
starting phase this can include the
required resources approvals and
documentations in place next one that we
have all over here is exit criteria exit
criteria ensures that a phase has met
its objectives and produced the expected
deliverables before moving on to the
next phase in software development exit
criteria for the coding phase might
include the completed code pass unit
test and code reviews this helps to
prevent incomplete or substandard work
from being passed along to the
subsequent
phases next we have all over here is
deliverables deliverables are the
tangible or intangible outputs produced
at the end of a phase deliverable serves
as a milestone and indicates a progress
within project in software engineering
common deliverables include requirement
specification design do documents Source
codes test plans and user manuals clear
deliverables help in measuring progress
and quality ensuring that each phase
contributes to the overall project
goals next one we have all over here is
called reports reports are the documents
that provide information on the status
progress and outcomes of phase or task
regular reporting keeps stakeholders
informed and allows for tracking and
assessing project performance in
software engineering reports might
include status updates risk assessment
issue logs and performance matrices
effective reporting helps in identifying
and addressing issues early ensuring
transparency and accountability
throughout the project now let us
discuss what are the benefits of these
phases so guys in context of software
engineering breaking a project into
phases or task with defined criteria and
deliverables offers several benefits the
first one that we get is structured
approach it provides a clear clear and
structured approach to project
management ensuring that each phase has
clear objectives and outputs next we
have the risk management here the entry
and exit criteria helps in identifying
and mitigating risk early by ensuring
that prerequisites are met and quality
standards are maintained and finally we
have all over here is quality assurance
where a clear exit criteria ensures that
each phase produces high quality outputs
contributing to the overall quality of
the final product so guys by breaking a
software engineering project into these
well- defined phases with clear entry
and exit criteria resource allocation
deliverables and Reporting mechanisms
the project managers can effectively
guide their teams to deliver highquality
software on time and within budget so
the PMP certification acknowledges
project managers who have demonstrated
their skills in managing people
processes and business priorities in
professional projects it's essentially a
mark of excellence and Leadership ship
in project
management so before you can apply for
the PMP exam you need to make sure you
meet certain criteria so it's like a
checklist to confirm that you have the
right background to take on the exam so
let's look at what you need to
qualify so there are two main sets of
criteria based on your educational
background let's break them down now if
you have a four-year college or
university degree you need to meet these
requirements you need 36 months of
experience leading projects in the past
8 years and 35 hours of project
management education or training or you
need to have a capm
certification now if you only have a
high school diploma a secondary school
diploma here's what you need 60 months
of experience leading projects in the
past 8 years and 35 hours of project
management education or training or a
capm certification so first you'll need
to gather information about your
experience and training so here's what
you'll need to document number one
projects you have L like where did you
work what was your role and what were
your responsibilities and how long did
the projects last and second training
you have completed which must include
which institutes did you attend what
courses did you complete how many
qualifying hours of project management
training do you have and so on so make
sure to have all these details ready to
go for your application so once you have
gathered all your information it's time
to complete and submit your PMP
application so here's a quick overview
of the
process so start by setting up your PMI
account you can do this now or wait

take breaks if you need to now before
you begin you must make sure that you
have registered for a PMI org user
account so having known all that now
let's move on to how the PMP exam will
look
like so you'll need to pass a rigorous
exam consisting of 180 questions
and you'll have 230 minutes which is
just a little over 3 hours and 45
minutes to complete the entire test so
that's a lot of questions so managing
your time effectively is key now this
isn't just any test though it's designed
by experienced project leaders to
reflect real life scenarios you'll face
on the job now the exam is also

includes around 200 multiple choice
questions so that was a complete
overview of the PMP exam now let's see
some of the tips that you can keep in
mind while preparing and writing the
exam so understand the exam content
outline so first first make sure you're
familiar with the PMP exam content
outline this document breaks down the
exam into domains tasks and enablers so
understanding this outline helps you
focus on what's really important for the
exam focus on the five domains like
people process business environment make
sure you know the tasks and enablers for
each domain now practice practice and
practice one of the most important tips
is to practice as much as you can taking
practice exams helps you get familiar
with the question format and identify
weak areas use flashcards for key terms
so flashcards are a fantastic tool for
memorizing key terms and Concepts then
focus on the most common Concepts so
some Concepts appear more frequently on
the exam than others so focus on these
high impact topics so key Concepts
include the five process groups 49
processes knowledge areas and formulas
so make sure you're comfortable with
these areas and then understand the
agile and traditional Frameworks so the
PMP exam tests both agile and
traditional project management
approaches so understand the principles
of agile as well as the traditional PM
methodologies review the agile Manifesto
scrum framework and how agile practices
integrate with traditional PMP processes
now while writing the exam read
questions carefully so during the exam
read each question carefully make sure
you understand what's being asked before
you jump to an answer now manage your
time wisely so time management is
crucial for such exams you have 230
minutes for 180 questions which means
you should aim for around 1.5 minutes
per question and then eliminate wrong
answers so if you're unsure about a
question what you can do is use a
process of elimination to narrow down
your choices so that's a wrap on our
tips for passing the PMP certification
