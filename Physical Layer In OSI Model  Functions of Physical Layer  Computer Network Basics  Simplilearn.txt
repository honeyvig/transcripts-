foreign
have we ever wondered how data is
transmitted through a network with the
highest search traffic well not to worry
today's topic is everything you need to
know about data transmission through
physical layer in the osir model

now without further Ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's session
to begin with we will look into the
structural model of the OSI model
advancing with the core topic that is
what is the physical layer in the SI
model
moving on with the attributes of the
physical layer
finally we will wrap up our session by
discussing the critical roles and the
importance of physical air in the Assam
model
now let's get started with the first
topic that is what is an osm model
to better understand the OSI model's
role in transmitting data from Network
to another
let's consider we have two networking
devices between which data is being
transferred
the part between the devices is called
Communication channel
let us assume that we
different operating system for the
network channel
to overcome such situation where the
data cannot be transferred due to the
different OS in the system
once a model is used
but uses the seven layer structure to
allow the conversion of data from the
upper model to the data that is to be
transferred
now let's take a look at the technical
definition of the USM model
the osm model stands for Open System
interconnection model
a specifically designed set of protocols
and standards governing the data's
modeling and conversion of proper
transmission
the Jose model is divided into seven
layers which perform specific functions
and apply protocols to maintain data
quality without any error
now let's move on to the main heading
for the session that is what is the
physical layer
the physical layer which provides and is
responsible for physical mode between
the sender and the receiver node in the
data transmission
this layer converts frames received from
the data link layer into bits that is in
terms of ones and zeros to be
transferred
it is also responsible for maintaining
the data quality by applying necessary
protocols and maintaining the bit rate
through the data transfer using wired
and wireless medium
now let's move on to the attributes of
the physical layer
the physical layer has multiple
attributes which is applies in the USM
model
the first is signals the data is to be
converted to signals for efficient data
transmission where it has two different
types
digital signals represents a network
pulses and Digital Data from the upper
layer whereas the analog signal is
converted data for transmission of the
model
the next attribute is known as
transmission medium the network function
is damaged without proper conversion at
the physical layer
it has two different types wide medium
the connections established is made
through application of cables example
fiber optic cable and coaxial cable
and the second type is wireless media
connection established using the
wireless communication Network example
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
the other attributes of the physical
layer are data flow which is defined as
a rate of information flow and the
transmission wireframe
the fact is that affect data flow rate
are error rate receiving incorrect data
due to noise in the transmission
encoding encoding data for transmission
over the network channel and the last is
bandwidth that is the transmission rate
of data in the channel
the last attribute are the physical
layers
noise in transmission
during data transmission the transmitted
data may get damaged or corrupted due to
multiple reasons
some of which are mentioned as
dispersion in this case details is
spread and overlapped during
transmission which causes damage to the
original data
then we have attenuation which is the
gradual weakening of the Network signal
over the transmission Channel
then we have data delay the transmit is
data reaches the destination system
outside the time specified
now let's move on to the role of the
physical layer in a model
the physical layer due to data
transmission ability performs multiple
roles which are the data bit are
converted to physical signals and
transmitted over the channel by the
physical layer
it also integrates multiple electronic
circuits for data transmission and apply
different technological Hardware
it is also responsible for translation
of data that is received from the upper
layer in the RSI model
now let's move on to the last setting
that is importance of physical layer
the physical layer is responsible for
maintaining the communication between
the hardware and the network model
without the physical layer the
conversation of data from upper layer
will halt which leads to collapse of the
communication model
it also handles data flow rate of the
data being transmitted along with the
time frame of the transmitted data
with this we have covered all the
important points and definitions related
to the physical layer in the osm model
