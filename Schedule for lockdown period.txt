hi Venus hope you're doing good and I
hope you are ready with all your energy
to start things fresh from tomorrow okay
so I mean it is announced that you
should stay at home of course you should
be safe and my solution is I want
everyone to be online okay so as the
offline classes are also suspended so
most of the mentors are working from
home ready to help you out in the best
way to enhance your preparation as much
as we can okay so taking this negative
situation into the best possibility to
invest your complete time in the
preparation or in in having some good
aspects like like rather than rather
than talking about the negative aspects
that are going around you the most
positive aspect for the preparation is
from now you can you you can be on the
track to sit for longer duration of time
and to work with the books so the main
test were working online and will try to
provide you the best from now and and
I want a reciprocation from you to work
hard and don't get panic about the
situation one and about the books okay
so from tomorrow we're going to start a
new subject you are away from home or
you are away from your hospital or you
are away from your colleges or you may
be away from your books so don't worry I
don't get panic about books everything
what is required for preparation will be
provided in the online okay the only
good thing is if you have a printer with
you or an accessibility to your printer
that is more than sufficient if not even
then you can study online you can work
on and you can read the books online
either in your laptop or desktop or at
least in your mobile or a tab okay so
I'm just going to give a brief idea that
what we are going to do from tomorrow
and how we are going to finish or crack
the things so basically in the upcoming
month okay in the upcoming one month
duration of time okay 40 44 30 or 40
days of generation of time my plan is to
cover subjects like form of
a part of Pharmacology will be covered
okay the one and the second thing is a
part of general pathology it will be
covered and the third is biochemistry
and the fourth one is the microbiology
so we have planned to cover all these
four subjects in parts as much as much
as we can and as fast as we can so first
of all why I have selected these four
subjects is access to the textbook is
very limited for these subjects okay you
need to learn few things what you have
to learn from where you have to learn
the group is going to guide you whether
you are in the hostel whether you are in
the college or out of collars or you are
in a clinic you have to read these books
or the references from the group stuff
only okay all these four separates the
first important aspect why I have picked
these four subjects according to the
scenario that is going outside is you'll
be more comfortable the group is going
to help you out in learning these
subjects from all the aspects so that's
the main thing why I have picked this
for so first of all I'm just going to
give a rough idea of the blueprint
according to the meat pharmacology is a
very very important and a tough subject
which is going to carry 14 marks out of
which seven for normal pharmacology and
seven for general form ecology sorry
what will form ecology or a dental form
ecology which mostly includes the
chemotherapy and anise aids local
anesthesia and general anesthesia and
few emergency tracks of which
chemotherapy was already done and people
who has missed chemotherapy chemotherapy
will be covered in further sessions no
need to worry about that
the second important is general
pathology so general pathology according
to the need blueprint is going to cover
seven marks biochemistry is going to
cover seven marks microbiology along
with general microbiology as well as
oral microbiology is going to cover 14
so this week this month we are going to
cover somewhere around 42 to 50 marks
the first important aspect and the
second important aspect what books to
follow what you need
you do from your side and how the group
is going to help will be discussed
individually to the specific topic on a
particular day on the group but I'm
going to give a rough idea of oral
analysis of the entire month okay so
this schedule will be up to April 30th
we don't know how the scenarios will
change as we move deep into the
incubation period of this coronavirus
but whatever we have planned I'll try to
give my best to approach this plan up to
April 30th
the government has planned only up to
March 31st but my plan is up to next
month okay
preferably I want you to be safe stay at
home everything what is required for the
preparation and what is required for
your plans towards the need or aims will
be provided by the group and whatever
best you can do from your side with all
the bases that are really required you
have to manage okay so first of all the
first subject I want to discuss is
biochemistry so what you need to do for
biochemistry is already mentioned the
books that need to be carried for
biochemistry is fibia okay as as few of
you people are starting fresh and may
not have this particular book with you
you can either keep your dental pulse if
you have as a reference or you can keep
your power-play books for biochemistry
synopsis okay so whatever that is really
required further preparation will be
provided don't worry and this textbook
that is mandatory or required is you're
such a nerd I know the book what you
have followed for biochemistry in your
user level so that is more than
sufficient and what whatever that is
possible from our side we are going to
provide at the best for biochemistry so
rough idea of what we are going to do
that is tomorrow 23rd so we are going to
cover general biochemistry general
biochemistry which includes maximum
about the cell
I mean about the cell wall cell that is
eukaryotic prokaryotic differences the
basic differences which are again a
common topics for your microbiology in
this month and we're going to cover all
the cell organelles their functions and
their metabolic activities what are what
not everything related to cell cell
biology will be covered which is a part
of your general microbiology also the
second day in the first half my plan is
to cover the structure of carbohydrates
then followed by the metabolism so
structure will be covered on 24th and
the metabolism will be covered on 25th
and I feel this is the most at most
important topic the most important topic
and you need to spend as much as time as
possible to learn every aspect related
to this and coming to the 26 we are
going to learn about the structure of
protein proteins and 27 we are going to
cover the metabolism of proteins as
already discussed I have splitted your
pharmacology into different parts and I
have distributed the form of ecology
here and there so the next one is 28th
March and 29th March we are going to
cover CVS drugs basics about the CVS
physiology basics about the CVS
physiology and followed by the drugs of
CVS will be covered on 28th and 29th so
30 I I feel like we need to cover the
lipids and the metabolism of lipids okay
then after 30 first I am planning to
cover some basics related to the I'll be
back to the biochemistry so 30 first I
am going to cover vitamins and minerals
all the aspects related to vitamins and
minerals wherever they are in all the
subjects I am going to cover vitamins
and minerals coming to the 1st April 1st
April I am going to cover and James I
feel I'm James is one of the easiest
topic among the list of the biochemistry
which can be
handled and second April and third April
my plan is to cover the nucleic acids
the metabolism of nucleic acids of the
synthesis of nucleic acid structure of
DNA and RNA your nucleotides base
everything whatever related to DNA and
RNA and nucleic acid in the chromosomes
will be covered and fourth and fifth
April okay I'm going to cover many other
missing topics in the biochemistry
straight away from the textbooks so we
are going to finish and polish the basic
things whatever we have related to the
biochemistry so that's what the plan is
and my side my plan is 5th April I'm
going to keep biochemistry 100 marks or
preferably 120 Mark's exam so be ready
your first sub exam will be on April 5th
that is on biochemistry so get ready for
April 5th examination from April 6th my
plan is to start the microbiology so
first I am going to deal the general
microbiology a part of already your
cells eukaryotic SPRO kinetics cell wall
cell structures and everything will be
covered in biochemistry basics so an
extinction of that further I'm going to
deal about the inflammation again this
inflammation is going to be inflammation
inflammation ated cells are going to be
part of your general pathology which
will be discussed in this month or in
this pack or in this combo only so then
after I am going to deal about the
immunity immune system or the immune
cells what not everything related to
immunity I will discuss about the
hypersensitivities I will discuss about
the complement systems complement
pathways what not everything related to
the immunity which moves around your
pareo you through surround your endo and
whatnot everything will be discussed in
the form of general microbiology on
sixth as well as seventh April then
after my plan is to cover so
bacteriology first of all I am going to
discuss the bacterial basics that is the
Grampa's to gram-negative what is the
difference between the cell wall or
gram-positive gram-negative culture
cultural techniques your staining
techniques
everything related to the basics of
bacteriology followed by we need to
discuss few bacteriology in the detail
which will be discussed on the group
okay so there are somewhere around 10 to
12 bacteria which are important for a
dental student has to be discussed so
this we are going to cover on 8th 9th
and 10th ok then after the next plan is
to cover the wire ology so wire ology
every every related virus there either
there Phi to six viruses which are
important will take one day so 11th we
are going to cover virus and followed by
12 we're going to cover biology
particularly 12 will be discussing more
of HIV hepatitis and help us which are
more important okay so then after 13th
April we're going to cover mycology
therefore important fungal which are
really required in examination point of
view will be covered in the group from
top to bottom and then after I'm going
to discuss on 14th April I'm going to
discuss parasitology there against six
parasites which are very important in
examination point of view will be
discussed in the group from top to
border then 15th April again I'm back to
pharmacology I'm going to cover a few
pharmacology related stuff that is drugs
acting on GI T or drugs which are used
in gastrointestinal tract diseases will
be covered okay
so this is what my plan is then after
16th I am going to start gentle path so
the basics of general path selling
health disease and healing all this
processor which are common for many
other diseases will be covered on sorry
16th April I am going to cover a
respiratory drugs again one more day for
former 17th I'll be back to general path
so general path I'm going to cover cell
in health and disease
so all related to your hyperplasia
hypertrophy metaplasia dysplasia
apoptosis so calcification dystrophic
hyper all related to the cell and I'm
going to cover the process of healing
oral and extramural bone healing and
everything 18th april i'm going to cover
fluid dynamics that is the fluid and
hydrodynamic disorders and all the stuff
the basic mechanism of formation of
edema and all these things will be
discussed on 18th april hemodynamics
okay and 19th I'm thinking of to keep an
exam that exam is on microbiology which
is already done and pharmacology
pharmacology that includes the CVS
respiratory and GID and 28 28 April I'll
be back I'll be back to your general
path leftover that is growth disorders
you talk about these cancers how these
genes works and how the genes are going
to help and everything and coming to the
21st I'm going to cover the genetics all
the chromosomes chromosome numbers
chromosomal disorders or all the stuff
related to genetics will be covered
which is a very very important topic
related to the need and 22nd my plan is
to cover the systemic pathology systemic
pathology is not that important in
examination point a few concerned to the
gentle students because they'll be
focusing mainly on the general pathology
aspects and oral pathology related stuff
rather than the systemic pathology so
whatever that is required for systemic
pathology like your amyloidosis
yes that there's a few aspects like
sarcoidosis actinomycosis few general
pathology related sistemics stuff will
be covered okay on that particular day
so coming to the 23rd so 23rd my plan is
to cover the 23rd April my plan is to
cover
Chantell pharmacology I mean this is the
only part of pharmacology which is the
conceptual stuff so all stuff related to
general pharmacology will be covered on
23rd 24th is again an easy topic that is
I'm going to cover in the morning of LA
followed by GA in the later half 25th is
again an easy topic of pharmacology that
is a mess aids will be covered and 26th
I am planning to keep the 120 marks
examination on general path and general
pharmacology the pharmacology part we
call these three pharmacologist will be
covered more of an oral form of
coalition or dental form of college so
then after you can have a good sensible
revision on 27th 28th and 29th and your
examination will be on 30th okay so this
exam will be for 240 marks which
includes 60 marks of pharmacology 60
marks of general path
60 marks of biochemistry and 60 marks of
microbiology so apart from this 240
marks Grand exempt I am planning to keep
three other exams sub exams which will
be the biochemistry exam on April 5th
for 120 marks and microbiology for
McCauley is the exam on 19th April for
120 Max and general paths and general
form ecology exam will be on 26th April
for 120 bucks apart from this there will
be many other examinations like
preferably a daily examinations or
topic-specific examinations the main
ideologies mentis are working online and
will provide you the stuff the difficult
stuff in the most easiest way so just
try to follow the group just try to
finish the task according to the group
schedule try to give exams try to be on
time because there is no other work
apart from reading or relaxing eating
and sleeping as we are not going
forwards
at home and peaceful okay thank you all
signing out dr. shreek on from team and
Diaz quarter stay safe and stay at home
bye take care
