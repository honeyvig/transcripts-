yeah hi Vanessa this is Dr srikan from
Team MDS conquer I hope you are doing
great so now I'll be discussing about
the plan for the upcoming few days
so in this upcoming few days we are
going to cover the following subjects
one is
Coral medicine in combination with
oral path
Plus
oral microbiology
second one is
Dental or not
third one is
Dental histo
and fourth one is
foreigntology
so either coming to the neat or in ICT
blueprints
so oral medicine is going to carry
seven marks
and oral path and oral microbiology are
going to carry 14 marks
d a is going to carry 7
d h is going to carry 7 and
foreigntology is going to carry 2 or 3
sometimes it's going to vary from two or
three mcqs so this is a rough rough
outline okay these these uh this
blueprint is according to neat slightly
one or two plus is going to vary for
your ionization it varies okay it varies
but need they are going to follow the
particular blueprint so in this upcoming
few days
this is the number of
questions we are going to work on right
so these are the number of questions we
are going to work on right so I tried my
best to simplify these contents
and to organize a perfect schedule for
the upcoming 11th World days to cover
these subjects keeping in mind the
number of days that are left over for
your examination are going to be 99.
okay assuming that the exam is going to
be on
January
8th
2023 for now
if there is any further
updates or notification from nbe
I'm immediately going to let you know
the change of the dates or anything but
as of now I want every one of you to
stick onto the plan that your
examination is going to be on January 8
2023 and November 13th
2022 is going to be your inict next
right so here I want every one of you
to try to segregate your days into
different parts
okay right so let it be an intern or let
it be a repeater okay so I was talking
to most of you the present interns
throughout the country I was talking to
most of you so it's better it's a peak
time till the official date was official
date is going to be out I want you to
take break from the college if there is
any possibility Okay so yesterday uh
Maharashtra finally result was out so
your finally students are going to
join the internship probably within a
couple of days so if it is possible I I
my suggestion for most of you I don't
know like it may or may not be possible
in many of the colleges okay they may
not permit you but if it is possible I
want you to take off from the college
for a week or two weeks at least from
now I think probably within a week or 10
days I'm assuming that and being will
come out with a new update if they
accept our request okay
to postpone the exam
ER to the mbbs people okay they accept
it probably the notification is going to
come in the upcoming two weeks if not
I think you need to stick on to the plan
January 8th
right so I want uh so according to my
schedule I want every one of you to
spend at least 10 to 12 hours
but it's a peak time we are left over
with
99 days less than 99 days so it is
mandated that you need to work out for
at least 10 to the follow-ups it's
mandatory it's a peak time and if you
are planning to end up with something
great and extraordinary on the day of
results so it's a time that you need to
improve the number of hours first of all
so my schedule for this upcoming 10 to
12 days I have splitted it into
main task
okay you can consider this major task
minor task one
minor task 2
and the plan to solve the repeats from
all the sides okay so as there are few
students who have started the
preparation long back probably maybe 10
months back six months back or five
months back okay so if you are done with
any of the subjects which are already
ongoing okay so you can consider these
minor tasks as a revision tasks
to get a proper segregated schedule or a
customized schedule basing upon your
preparation okay for example you are
already done with dental and or dental
histology or if you're already done with
oral path oral medicine the present
running subjects okay if you want I'm
going to give a customized schedule
that's a different story okay or else
you can consider this minor minor tasks
you can convert them into a revision
task and you try to restart subjects
where you are weak at where you are
incomplete where you are not confident
you can drop those subjects and you can
cover those subjects right so the major
task should be half of your half of your
day for example if it's a 12 hour
schedule it should go around like five
and a half to
six hours should be the my major task
and followed by these threes has to be
splitted into six hours that is two
hours for this
two hours per second Miner and two hours
for repeats so basing upon this you have
to plan your schedule
okay your schedule goes like this
so October 1st today like a few of you
are done with your examination followed
by I hope you have done with the
analysis okay and October 2nd the main
task this is main task
this is your minor task one minor task
two or you can consider it as a revision
task okay so I want you to cover the
developmental disturbances of overall
and paraveral structures you have a
video available on the website so I want
you to cover the Smart Video followed by
solve the mcqs
source of mcqs can be your dental pulse
or dentist or you have a number of mcqs
available on the website
right so followed by I want you to cover
the benign and malignant tumors of the
oral cavity video is available again
Smart Video is available so most of
these topics are linked to your smart
video Smart Video is something like in a
storytelling okay so the mentors were
sitting in front of you okay they take
30 to 40 minutes to tell all the
important
conditions and the questions that are
being asked most common areas clinical
photographs radiographical photographs
directly from the textbook so it's
something like a storytelling you have
to sit understand it that's all okay
it's almost like a reading of a synopsis
okay so once you're done with a smart
video I want you to jump into McQ solve
as many mcqs as possible right so this
is going to be your mine major task or
the main task where you need to should
not spend more than five to six servers
it may be easy sometimes it may be
difficult but make sure your alarm
should work on and it should not be more
than five to six hours for example an
intern is able to read only eight hours
per day
so this minor my major task should be
four hours
and these three should be four hours
so it will be like one and a half hour
it will be like one and a half hour
okay and it will be like one hour this
is how we need to split fifty percent of
the time has to be given to the main
task
so in the minor task okay task one I
want you to start Dental histology
two hours this topic can be done in two
hours you have a smart video simple
smart video all the important points are
discussed in the smart read I don't want
you to waste time on writing the notes
understand the videos videos will be
available on the website till you enter
the examination Hall whenever you want
you can revise if you want you can write
a running row scribbling notes but don't
write heavy notices don't write uh heavy
heavy notices using Glitters using using
markers because we don't have time
because the number of days left over are
just 99.
so a minor task 2 I want you to jump
into
deciduous dentition Dental Anatomy
you have a smart video followed by mcqs
and dental Pulsar dentists any of the
book and followed by evening we'll have
an activity and followed by you can
solve mcqs that are available on the
website same schedule
so last two hours of the day
make sure this can be any time
wherever I feel a bit slow like probably
repeaters who are reading in the offline
centers or at the homes they may feel a
bit
DG probably after having a meal after
having a dinner or late night so I want
you to do repeats okay with a proper
explanation okay don't mug up the
answers because we have time
so I want you to go through the question
go through the answer and read some
Associated synopsis to try to understand
for example if a question is on a
classification I want everyone to be
perfect with the classification not with
the question I'm least bothered about
the question so you should be perfect
with the topic and you should be perfect
with the content over the question
so jumping into October 3rd so this is a
Sunday so use your Sunday properly
so October 3rd is going to be Monday
so here you are going to cover salivary
gland disorders maybe a bit a bit time
taking topic okay so followed by spread

healing this is a healing process it's a
small topic oral aspects of metabolic
diseases allergic and immunological
diseases of the oral card all these are
very very minor topics they are not
going to take more than 10 or 15 minutes
to finish these topics okay so
everything was properly organized on the
website so please try to finish smart
videos available on the website followed
by try to solve as many mcqs from the
sources available that can be Dental

so then I want you to revise do the
repeats okay and the pp books for all

right so checklist
checklist to be done
must checklist to be done is one is
if you are a pro-life student
So Pro live questions has to be done
or if you're an offline student
offline question papers has to be done
so this is must
must
must must must must
followed by rest all students whether it
is a plan A
plan Pro
offline
SX SX Pro whatever it is
whatever plans you are it is mandatory
that you have to do all the repeats
from 2000 17 2018
2019 2020
2021 22 will be doing don't worry I'll
make sure we'll be doing together 22
will be doing together so don't break
your heads for 22. so all these
questions are available on your dental
pulse as well as on the website
Dental pulse
as well as on the
website
right
so these are the must okay
right followed by
daily WhatsApp activity so WhatsApp
activity has to be done
WhatsApp activity has to be done okay
and followed by I want you to Mark the
questions Market questions
when solving Dental pulse or any sort of
book
while you are solving the first for the
first time you are going to Mark some
questions so make sure
you try to do the marked questions
and try to focus on the content what you
have marked
while watching the smart video
okay of course
if you are not able to do this sir
time is running short we are not able to
do this marked stuff you're telling to
Mark and do it not possible now
then you can directly solve PP books
PP books were written by toppers
okay
which was basically written by me which
was a refined updated by many many
Toppers okay so this is almost like a
notes of a Topper okay so they have
marked
underlined everything and now finally
they have converted a nodes so if you
are not able to mark and if you are
worried that you have not marked or not
underlined then you can directly jump
into PP books PP books will have
contents moving on the memory based
contents okay so tables classifications
very important diagrams frequently asked
questions frequently Asked numericals
frequently as scientist names frequently
Asked memory based questions were stored
there so whenever you are not in a
position to decide what to be done for
this particular subject in a limited
time you can close open PP books and you
can start solving so this is a checklist
that you have to do at any cost okay so
for example uh if you have fall under a
service service category so there are
many states who are having the service
quota you have Tamil Nadu having service
quota you have Telangana is having
service quota Orissa is having service
quota right so you have Kolkata having
service quota okay so there are many
many states provide adding service quota
seats exclusively okay means you have to
stand best among the service so if you
are a service category candidate who is
already working in a government sector
and who is preparing for your entrance
examination hoping that your dream to do
MDS has to be done in the next two years
or next year okay so I want you to stick
on to the checklist I know that you are
busy with your personal life you may
have one or two kids
okay
you have to run behind the patients
manage the hospital manage the home
there are many things that you are being
doing I I know I know personally I was
talking to most of you I was in touch
with most of you I know that your
children are preparing for using it and
you are preparing for a piece unit this
sounds very great and your you are a
sort of inspiration for most of us okay
let it be a service or anything okay you
are you're an inspiration for most of us
because you have lots of
responsibilities and you have the
courage to study and give a tough
competition to the present generation
and there are many many such Souls such
such people who has really made it
possible okay who are really made it
possible I'm hats off to all those
people okay right so I want service
people I want you to stick to the
checklist mostly to the checklist like
if you're a pro-life student stick to
the questions of prolab revise them
repeatedly because you need to top the
service category not to top the country
it's okay even if you top the country
that's in depth that's the next level of
preparation it's really appreciated but
at least you need to be top
among your service list similarly a
category category like if you have a
category okay at least I want you to top
the category list okay so for the for
those category of people I want you to
check onto the checklists okay if you're
a pro live stick on to the checklist if
you're an offline student
S I mean stick to the stick to the
checklist that is I want you to give
more importance to the content that's
being discussed in the offline content
that is being discussed in the problem
or I want you to give more importance to
the repeats okay probably from like uh
2017 2018 2019 2020 or your dental pulse
will be having uh mcqs in bracket they
are going to tell which year it is being
given I want you to be perfect with all
the mcqs and a little bit of associated
synopsis at least from 2012 2012 13 14
15 16 17 18 19 20 21. so if from
2012 to 2020 it's going to be 10 years
so every year you're going to have some
30 odd questions from these subjects so
it's it's turns to 300 to 400 questions
which is more than sufficient for you to
grab that
top one to uh in your service quota okay
right so I mean like I hope you can
manage the time if you are not able to
manage the time make sure the priority
should go accordingly so the first
priority
student is going to be pro-life happens
often students is going to be offline
papers the second checklist is going to
be the repeats from 2017 to 2021. the
third checklist is going to be your
WhatsApp activity fourth checklist is
marked questions and marker notes if you
are not able to do this directly jump
into PP books this is what you need to
focus on this is what you need to give
importance
and the most important
quality that is required for every one
of you is Trust
first of all you have to trust yourself
100 is secondly you have to trust your
mentor
right so the bond between the mentor and
the aspirant is very very very very
important the bond is very important for
you to be successful
yeah so you need to trust yourself first
of all you need to trust your friends
friends around you who are supporting
you you need to trust your family who is
supporting you okay so there were many
inspiring parents inspiring uh friends
co-ass parents brothers sisters husbands
nowadays we see husbands even even I can
say wives who are supporting their
husband to do MDS okay so taking a lap
of five years six years ten years 15
years there were students who has who
has more than 18 20 years also after
finishing videos after 20 years they
have restarted the preparation it sounds
very energetic very good to hear all
these stories okay and it's very
inspiring so this is what the energy we
always gain from you and this is how we
redistribute the energy so it's it's
something like an exchange of energy the
positive energy the Positive Vibes which
I strongly believe it's going to work
out well okay so let's work hard
and
do some Magics okay right so
so I'm always available for you okay I'm
on my helpline on my lifeline number so
you can contact me at any time okay so
right so this is all uh so as of now I'm
signing off Dr srikanth from Team MBS
