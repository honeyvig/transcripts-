um good afternoon everyone i'm dr
aishwarya
and i'm a neuropathologist hi everyone
this is dr madhuri from oral medicine
and radiology
actually i'm going to file with rapid
questions okay you're going to start or
let me start
i'll ask you a question all right okay
so um
this is a very common question and a
scenario that we see every day
in our dental clinic okay so imagine if
you had a female patient
okay who comes with you who has um how
should i put it
her eyes clear are whitish and her
tongue
is uh very white and depopulated
and she said that she had uh anemia in
the past
okay so what would be the first syndrome
that you could think of
okay we can think of uh plum about
plumber winston syndrome okay
so this glamour vinson syndrome can be
called as like patterson kelly syndrome
or
uh cyrophonic dysphagia also so you have
told about
iron deficiency on india right so the
main component of the syndrome will be
iron deficiency anemia
okay along with this iron deficiency
anemia you can see the
dysphagia also this dysphagia is because
of esophageal verbs
okay and one more important point is
about the chiropractor
so in those kind of patients we need to
go for a barium swallow
to detect the esophageal verbs okay okay
now i'm going to give it
clinical scenario okay so a male patient
he came to my clinic okay so he had a
diagnosis
with fibrous dysplasia earlier
okay and he also has a brown color
type of molecules in face and the trunk
okay
i'm like can you name the syndrome i
have another question so okay
how is the growth part of the child that
the patient has a growth so i
think uh
i would my diagnosis would mostly be
towards uh machine algorithm syndrome
okay because if you would have told me
that the developmental milestone of the
child was normal
i would prefer choosing syndrome but
since uh
you said it can you tell clearly about
the japanese improvement
so the main difference between uh jaffa
syndrome and
albertson syndrome is jackie syndrome
does not have
this any sort of endocrine disturbances
hence the growth the development
of precocious puberty is not uh seen in
this
whereas in case of mercury apart from
having
the most common bone involvement would
be fibrous dysplasia
and you also see uh this uh endoplanet
disturbances
[Music]
discoloration the second thing being
your endocrine disturbances
and the third being your fibrous
displacement system
okay so now i have a very interesting
question for you okay
now suppose if you have a diabetic
patient who comes to your
for a checkup and
this patient what would be the first
thing that would bounce off your head
thinking there's a syndrome associated
with the diabetes the
is having hypertension also yes okay
so i think this patient might complain
with the burning sensation also
because the most common syndrome
associated with this
diabetes and hypertension along with
oral liking planners
easier brinspan syndrome okay so ask
your patient whether he had the burning
sensation in the mouth
and also ask about the stress
of the patient so you can rule out this
greenspan syndrome okay okay
now i'll give you syndrome that is triad
syndrome
okay tell you two important components
you have to fill the third component
along it you have to make the same okay
and
the patient has the first component of
the syndrome is a double lip
okay and the second important component
is in non
uh toxic thyroid enlargement okay so
what is the third
component of the tract and so obviously
this is like a very
common thing for us in between
nothing but the drooping of the lips the
lower lid
the skin folds underneath it and um
along with the other two things that you
see the components is double lip which
is cartoonically for
present okay apartment you have the
third thing that is your non toxic
it is nothing but the enlargement of the
thyroid gland without impairing the
functionality hope you guys like this
session
and i had a very entertaining uh
colleague of mine
who actually asked such a question which
uh make you think
so let's continue this and you will be
seeing a lot more of us
soon
