hi everyone
hi everyone uh
hi everyone hope you're doing good
so now in this particular session I'm
planning to discuss A2 jet related stuff
related to your ortho okay what to be
done how to be done where to be done
what are the things that you need to
give utmost importance what things has
to be revised again and again and the
trend changes in order questions very
specifically and I'll be talking all
relate to Ortho for your neat and ICT
preparation
so first and foremost thing I want to
introduce my team okay the first comes
is Dr gauri Shankar uh who is well known
for his books and everything okay he has
more than 25 years experience in
handling the need MDS as well as inact
MDA students and he's the first one who
has started the MDS based coaching
Center in the entire country and he's an
author of dentist which has more than 24
to 25 years experience and of course the
dentist is the first need MDS based book
okay so we are privileged to have gauri
Shankar sir as an as a core team member
as well as as a person who is going to
handle the upcoming author subject and
next comes Dr Usha uh who has who has
six to seven years experience in
handling neat MDA students and who is
working with Team MDS conquer from past
six years and the university topper of
Indian University she is an Indian
University topper and followed by I'm
just going to handle the game plan and
the the integration of Ortho relate to
other subjects so okay I'm privileged to
have this golden team and of course you
you are going to have a best experience
in handling the author in the upcoming
few days
so next comes basically I want to focus
on uh I mean like the number of
questions that Ortho is going to carry
so according to neat uh need MDS
blueprint which is given by nbe people
Ortho is going to carry 14 okay but
there will be few concepts of Arthur
will be integrated to other subjects so
I'm going to add plus three so it's
going to turn around like 7 to 8 17 to
18 because Ortho is most often a Time
integrated to uh subjects like pedo okay
and it's more of an integrated to dental
materials because there will be 10
percentage of dental materials topics
related to Ortho Ortho will be related
to your oral surgery as an orthognathic
surgical process that's an apart from
this there are lots of other subjects
directly or indirectly related to uh
Ortho like for example like you talk
about embryology
okay so embryology is again related to
whatever the structures of Bones
movements uh all this like biomechanics
and everything like that they're more
often integrated here and there but it
is more exclusively related to a pedo
okay right pedo and DM are uh the first
and second priority according to me and
coming to ini CET in ICT almost have uh
the equal weight is uh equal weight is
for Arthur like maybe like 15 to 20 and
sometimes more than 20 because we don't
have a proper weightage system for
ironic because it has been handled by
multiple bodies uh in in handling the
question prep and preparing the question
paper so it varies it varies but
basically it's going to be around like
15 to 20 in an hour like 15 to 20 20 or
sometimes 20 plus so this is what
basically you need to handle and why I
am stressing Ortho author is totally
going to be in a unique subject among
the list of your eight clinical subjects
which are going to be in your pathway
and I hope you know that your neat MDS
paper is being divided into party and
Part B part A is going to for B for 100
marks and Part B is going to be for 140
and Part B will be focused more on the
your final year separates your eight
subjects and out of these eight subjects
definitely uh the unique subject is
going to be is definitely an unique
subject uh the reason why I'm adding a
word unique or uh to translating the
trend setting aspect of question papers
is more inclined towards Arthur is artha
is something which we don't practically
do anything uh on the patient at a UC
level whereas rest you say you take
enter you do something you take operator
you do something pedo you do oral
surgery you do prosto you do
okay whatever it is like any subjects
any any clinical subject you are going
to do something on the patient but also
is something which we don't do on the
patient okay that's the first important
thing so whatever you do in Ortho
whatever you read in order it's an
imaginary part so what happens in the
latest examinations like for example you
see the latest ionize ET or latest need
that is need 2022 latest paper or like
the upcoming 2023 papers so artha is
more of an incline towards a clinical
scenario they're just giving a clinical
scenario it's not a heavy Hi-Fi clinical
scenario but a basic common sense or uh
like the basic Common Sense related
clinical scenario which requires your
imagination to be kept in a practical
point of view so that requires more work
to be done for an ortho okay so among
all the clinical subjects I what you
need to work more towards Ortho and next
comes is the process because prosto
whatever we do is is just hardly a 10 10
percentage of process
so this is this is the level of a
clinical aspect at a user level so the
imaginary part will be more like so
subjects which are having imaginary part
more you need to work more you need to
imagine more you need to get that into a
practical imaginary part then you have
to read so that is the trickiest part of
Ortho followed by prose Ortho is going
to stand first according to me the next
comes with the process I promise you my
team my author team is going to make the
things cool compost simple
with their experience and with their
smartness so Arthur drift so what is the
drift of Arthur five years back to five
years now to the present day is uh
previously the questions are like an
open-end questions or something called
as a single liner single line questions
okay facial index normal value is what
facial index is given by okay so this
syndrome is going to have what what is
the treatment plan for this habit so
these are the something like or
according to this particular
classification what is something so
these are called as an open end or a
single line based question that does not
require any clinical knowledge if you
just know your Concepts and you can just
right away hit the right answer but when
you're coming to the prison scenario
most of the times they are linking with
the clinical scenario giving a
cephalometrics giving a radiograph and
ask giving a clinical photograph and
asking a clinical based question but
it's simple but you should know you
should have that clinical common sense
to judge these questions so that is the
drift of uh the questioning of Ortho so
that's what like whatever materials
which are available for us in digging
out and learning or so may not be
helpful uh in the same way in the same
pattern to handle a question in the
examination that is a toughest part that
Ortho or the questions are coming and
the students are facing that's what my
my plan like you need to learn those
things but you need to apply those
things that's what the second part where
our mentors will be focusing in the
upcoming few days so this is an outline
of Arthur okay so how many questions are
coming from inict how many questions are
coming from me decent weight is subject
which is unique so you need to work hard
you need to imagine more you need to
learn better and you need to take the
help of mentors there is a drift of
questioning five years back to the
present question papers lots of drifting
of the questions so for this you require
an application power and you require
some sort of Hardware from your side
when you're reading subjects like Ortho
and particularly prose the next subject
okay so now uh with my knowledge over uh
last 10 years so I have listed out few
important topics which has to be done
and of course we have prepared lots of
videos lots of content on these things
to make things easy and simple for you
okay so these are the list of topics
like growth and development etiology of
malocclusion development of dentition
growth rotations are frequently being
asked in inict related to PJ PGA people
they love to ask questions on growth
rotations look whenever the PGA people
are preparing a question paper so that
you can just predict these tricky growth
rotation based questions which are very
very difficult for a ug student to
understand and next comes the occlusion
classifications of occlusion these sub
topics that I get integrated to your
Pros though and a DA and Ortho
radiography related to Radiology
skeletal maturity indicators you're
familiar with subflow Matrix is one of
the time important thing and followed by
the study models model analysis
diagnosis part got the tooth movement
Basics anchor is retention relapse okay
preventive is important interceptive is
important removal Appliance important
fixed appliances are important
biomechanics is important myofunctional
appliances are important of course these
are the important topics that you need
to stress and this information is
collected from uh collector from the
questions which are given in the last
couple of you have a basic skeleton
which is done by most of the uh I mean
like most of the students or most of the
mentors but apart from the basic
skeleton I have added few more important
things which are frequently Asked in the
last five years which are uncovered or
which are being ignored or which are
being neglected in many many standard
McQ Books Okay so my focus is to cover
as much stuff as possible so this is
what the plan that we are coming out
with
so next comes uh I mean like I I don't
know the goal of a particular student
but I I know that you can stick onto
your basic books like what you have
referred uh during your ug level for
your basic reference like whenever you
want to refer something whenever you
want to understand something better it's
okay like because a few of you have done
your final year recently and few of you
are done you're finally a long back but
it's okay if you want to refer you can
refer whatever book you have done in
your final year that's okay no
objections okay and in most of the
situations you don't need to refer a
book because most of the content is
already uh being discussed or well
explained by the mentors with with lots
of ease and everything
on your regular video session so you
don't need to break your heads referring
books XYZ but my suggestion if you want
to really refer a book for a particular
topic and if you're focusing on ironic
okay so normal books that most of us
will do is like either Balaji or
textbook of author by babri Shankar said
so these are the books that we are
regularly refer at a usual level but if
you want to refer or understand
something you can go with those books
but if you are focusing on I and i c e t
if you're focusing on iron ICT then
definitely this book is the book should
be referred because they are very very
high yield points and it's it's a it's a
PC level book but of course we don't
have any other option okay there were so
many straight away questions from this
particular book in so many exams of I
and i c e t uh right so if you're
planning for in ICT so for Ortho to get
a good scores this book references
mandatory so wherever you feel like you
want to refer you can go back and check
this book and refer so next to solve an
McQ okay so I I like most of you you
know you can plan accordingly the basic
books whatever you're going but if you
want to be more organized okay I
recommend
I recommend any of these books to be
followed okay either dentist by Dr gauri
Shankar or either by either either
McKesson Ortho by sharonson okay so any
of these books are very very good the
books are very huge like for example
Sharon is a very huge book for an ortho
okay there are few people they are going
to do these books because it is more of
an integrated other subjects also but as
as I said like if it is a repeater yes
of course you have to read a number of
books but it is an intern uh as there is
a Time limitation it I strongly
recommend you to be perfect with at
least one single proper book like either
you can take dentist or either you can
take either you can take Dental pulse
okay Dental pulse I prefer like dentist
is going to be a better option for Ortho
because it is the main author of dentist
is Dr gauri sir and he is an
orthodontist which has a vast experience
and definitely I strongly recommend to
go with dentist as a better option than
the dental pulse keeping in mind about
the content content that optimized
content that is there at the dentist and
the next comes is like of course if you
want to finish the things fast of course
the pp book volume one has your ortho in
combination with Peter and I strongly
recommend you to uh read them read them
probably in the last two to three days
of the preparation because most of the
important memory based things tables
values to be done it's more often like a
short notes of some 50 odd pages that
has to be done that has to be revised
flow if you ask me what has to be
referenced to Arthur very frequent lag
and simply say PP book volume one you go
for Ortho revise the tables revise the
numbers revise the scientist names
whatever it is everything that is memory
based is clearly given in the book so
you can keep this book for revision not
for the first round of reading
okay you can keep this book for
reference
that is preferably if you are planning
for ionize heating or if you're simply
targeting your neat MDS okay you want to
make your preparation simple you can
just go back to your basic books like
whatever you have done that can be
either Balaji or that can be either
textbook of Ortho by governments or any
of these books are basic references
those are more than sufficient if you
want to be perfect uh I recommend
dentist
followed by DP okay it's it's completely
your wish like which is accessible which
is available for you you can decide
basing upon the dip both the books are
available I strongly recommend to go
ahead with the dentist okay whatever
book the contents will be almost same
that's what I regularly uh interact with
the students I interact with the authors
and everything like we regularly talk
the contents of the books will be same
okay it will be same whatever that is
there the DP whatever that is there in
the dentist Sharon whatever it is like
and the mode of teaching of the coaching
centers will always be the same there
always teach the same content but
approach of the content varies that can
be from the book or that can be from the
mentor or that can be from a particular
coaching Center so the contents we are
going to teach only we don't teach
something like extraordinary artwork
that's nothing called as extraordinary
we teach they teach or everyone they
teach others so similarly I'm talking
about books like if you have both go for
dentist as a first priority if you don't
have both like you can go for either
Dental pulse or dentist basing upon your
wish and there will be few topics if you
do from Sharon that could be
extraordinary but you check out the
availability of the book in your
particular College library or your study
areas or anything like we will talk
about that particularly uh on our
respective groups when we start the
proceedings so this is outline of the
books to be referred and I strongly
recommend any one of this
for interns particularly so rather than
digging out two books breaking your time
and uh like enable to complete the
revision and everything is equal to one
repeaters if you have more time you can
reference also as already discussed so
go ahead so coming to the checklist
so you have Smart videos
for most of the topics you have Smart
readers and they're well organized with
lots of diagrams and lots of imaginary
clinical based scenarios and everything
whatever that is possible the few
mentors like they have added mcqs also
so lots of stuff is there you need to
spend more quality of time in checking
out the smart videos okay so once you
are done with the smart videos I want
you to jump into the McQ solving okay so
McQ McQ solving okay so McQ solving I
want you to start the McQ solving either
you can take a book already discussed
what books to be done and uh preferably
we are going to provide the question
Bank also on the website
so I think the question Bank is open it
is not open for all the topics we are
slowly filling the question Bank the
recent update on the website apart from
your topic specific exam there is
something called as question Bank where
you can solve question by question
something like how you solve the
questions in DP how you solve the
questions in dentists how you solve the
questions in McQ book you can solve the
questions similarly in website also
there's something called as question
Bank option on the website which is
updated five days back
so I want you to solve the questions
like solve the questions understand the
concepts know the mistakes then I want
you to attend the evening activity
so every day we'll have an evening
activity okay okay uh evening activity
will not be there whenever there is a
prologue session or whenever it is
revision we don't have any evening
active Whenever there is an exam
Whenever there is a pro live session or
whenever there is a revision we don't
take an evening activity or else
regularly you will have 30 to 40 minutes
of activity the main mode of this
activity is to exchange the energy and
give some motivation every day so that
you're going to make your preparation
active Okay so this is going to be
handled by either gauri Shankar sir
evening activity then fourth comes is I
want you to give like after finishing
these things okay I want you to give
your topic specific exam on the next day
before you talk you start already you
want to give on the same day you can
give it a topic specific uh specific
exam will be there on Ortho folder after
take after clicking on the taking take
exam so you can give that author topic
specific examination so this these are
the four things which are mandatory
for anyone whether it's a repeater or
intern
or housewife mother Phoenician whatever
it is wherever you're from okay you're
part of conquer I want to make sure you
check out all these four things uh on on
the author so this is the mandatory
checklist that you have to do so apart
from this you'll have uh Pro live
classes Pro live classes of Ortho
preferably we are planning to have three
to four Pro live classes okay and the
schedule of Ortho uh will be posted on
your recipe so this is an outline of
Ortho what to be done how to be done
where to be done and uh XYZ stuff if you
have any doubts you can just
drop your doubts on your comment box so
that we are ready to help you out even
if you are a student of MDS conquer or
not we are here to help you out in all
the ways so make sure Arthur is unique
Ortho is tough Ortho is interesting so
when someone is unique someone is tough
someone is interesting so first thing
what we have to do we start loving the
people okay so then there will be more
comfortable then there will be more easy
see then they'll be more close to us so
I want everyone to love for the upcoming
14 to 14 15 days okay so it's going to
be interesting journey and let's enjoy
this particular part with the team MDS
conquer signing off srikant from Team
