hello everyone
i welcome you all to simply learn
today
we'll discuss the types of distribution
in statistics
but before we move ahead
let's have a brief introduction on what
is probability distribution
a probability distribution is a list of
all of the possible outcomes of a random
variable along with the corresponding
probability values
and it is used in many fields but we
rarely do explain what they are
so in this video we will discuss the
three main types of probability
distribution that is normal binomial and
poisson distribution
so let's move ahead
so what is normal distribution
normal distribution is a continuous
probability density that has a
probability density function which gives
us a symmetrical bell curve
now data can be distributed or spread
out in different ways but there are many
cases where the data tends to be around
a central value with no bias to the left
or right which means that it doesn't
show any particular spikes towards the
left or the right
and it gets close to a normal
distribution
half of the data will fall on the left
of the mean and the other half will fall
on the right
now let's take a look at a graph which
shows the height distribution in a class
as you can see the average height is in
the middle and the
data to the left of the average height
represents the short people and the data
to the right of it represents the taller
people
the y-axis shows us the likelihood of
any of these heights occurring the
average height has the most distribution
or it has the most number of cases in
the class and as the height decreases or
increases the number of people
who have that height also decreases
this kind of a distribution is called a
normal distribution where the average or
the mean is always the highest point
and any other point
after that or before that
is significantly lower
the resulting data gives us a bell curve
and as you can see there is no abrupt
bias or spike in the data anywhere
except for the average height
so this kind of a curve is called a bell
curve and it's usually seen in a normal
distribution
the reason we call this a normal
distribution is because the data is
normally distributed with the average
being the highest and all the other data
points having a lower likelihood
now we came across two terms
which are associated with normal
distribution continuous probability
density
and probability density function
what is continuous probability density
continuous probability density
is a probability distribution where the
random variable x can take any given
value
because there are infinite values that x
could assume the probability of x taking
on any specific value 0. for example
let's say you have a continuous
probability density for men's height
what is the probability that a man will
have the exact height of 70 inches
it is impossible to find this out
because the probability of one man
measuring exactly 70 inches is very low
it is more probable that he will measure
around 70.1 inches or maybe
69.97 inches and it doesn't stop there
the fact is that it's impossible to
exactly measure any variable that's on a
continuous scale and because of this
it's impossible to figure out the
probability of one exact measurement
which is occurring in a continuous
probability density
next we have the probability density
function it's nothing but a function or
an expression which is used to define
the range of values that a continuous
random variable can take an example of
this would be to gorge the risk and
reward of a stock
a probability density function is a
statistical measure which is used to
catch the likelihood of a discrete value
a discrete variable can be measured
exactly while a continuous variable can
have infinite values
however for both continuous as well as
discrete variables we can define a
function
which gives us the range of values
within which
these variables will fall
and that function is known as the
probability density function
now let's take a look at standard
deviation
what is standard deviation
standard deviation is used to measure
how the values in your data differ from
one another or how spread out your data
is
a standard deviation is a statistic that
measures dispersion of a data set
relative to its mean
the standard deviation is calculated as
a square root of variance by determining
each data point's deviation relative to
the mean if the data points are further
from the mean that means that there's a
higher deviation within the data set
and then
the data is said to be more spread out
this leads to a higher standard
deviation too
let's take an example of income in rural
and urban areas
in rural areas let's say such as farming
areas the income doesn't differ that
much more or less everyone earns the
same
because of this a bell curve has a very
low standard deviation and it has a very
narrow peak
however in urban areas the wealth
distribution
is very uneven some people can have very
high incomes and can be earning a lot
while other people can have very low
incomes the furthermore the data
distribution between these two income
points is going to be more spread out
because there are a lot more people
living there who work in various fields
and who have various incomes
because of this our standard deviation
is more spread out and a bell curve will
also have a wider peak
now how can we find the standard
deviation
standard deviation is obtained by
subtracting each data value from the
mean and finding the squared average of
these values
let's look at how we can do this with
the help of an example
these values correspond to the height of
various dogs
we can find the mean by finding the
average of all these values which is
nothing but adding all the values and
dividing it by the total number of
values the mean that we get is 394.
this means that the average height of a
dog is 394 millimeters
to find the standard deviation first we
need to subtract the height from the
mean this will tell us how far from the
mean our data points actually are
next we will square up all of these
differences and add them up and again
divide it by the total number of values
that we have this is called the
variance the variance that we get in
this case is 21704
finally when we find the square root of
this value we will get the standard
deviation the standard deviation here is
147
the standard deviation will tell us how
our data points differ from the average
and it gives us a basic value suggesting
how spread out our data is from the very
middle or from the mean so when we plot
these values this value 147 will mean
that a curve will have a width of 147
points around the mean
now what is the standard normal
distribution
the standard normal distribution
is a type of normal distribution that
has a mean of zero and a standard
deviation of one this means that the
normal distribution has its center at
zero and it has intervals which increase
by one all normal distributions like the
standard normal distribution
are unimodal and symmetrically
distributed with a bell-shaped curve
however a normal distribution can take
on any value as its mean and standard
deviation
in the standard normal distribution
however the mean and standard deviation
are always fixed
when you standardize a normal
distribution the mean becomes zero and
the standard deviation becomes one
this allows you to easily calculate the
probability of certain values occurring
in your distribution
or to compare data sets with different
mean and standard deviations the curve
shows a standard normal distribution as
you can see again the data is centered
at 0.
this does not mean that the data
necessarily starts at zero this means
that after standardizing this point is
where our mean will lie
in a standard normal distribution the
standard deviation is one so all the
data points will increase or decrease in
steps of 1.
let's better understand a standard
normal distribution with the help of an
example
again as you can see the data is
centered around 0 which is nothing but
the mean
let's again consider the weights of
students in class 8. the average weight
here is around 50 kgs and the data
increases and decreases in steps of 5.
the data over here in this curve is
evenly distributed along these steps
this is what a standard normal
distribution will look like
we already know that the mean of our
data is 50 and because the data is
increasing and decreasing in equal steps
we can just standardize it and take it
to mean
that the data is increasing and
decreasing in steps of one
this is what a standard normal
distribution look looks like and when
you have a data which looks like this
you can always standardize it and
convert it into a standard normal
distribution now standard normal
distribution has a couple of properties
which makes calculation comparatively
easy
the first one is that 68 of the values
fall within the first standard deviation
which means that 68
of all data values on this curve will
fall between the range of minus one to
one or the first
interval ranging from minus one to one
the second property is that 95
of the rest of the values are within the
second standard deviation or from the
second negative point to the
second positive point
and
finally 99.7
of the values fall within the third
standard deviation or from the third
negative point to the third positive
point
this makes calculations on standard
normal distribution fairly easy you can
compare scores on different
distributions with different means and
standard deviations
you can normalize scores for statistical
decision making using standard normal
distribution
you can find the probability of
observations in a distribution which
fall above or below a given value and
finally you can find the probability
that a mean significantly differs from a
population mean
now let's take a look at
z-score so what is a z-score a z-score
is used to tell us how far from the mean
our data point actually is
it is calculated using the mean and
standard deviation so it can be said
that the z-score is how many standard
deviations below the mean our data is
basically by using the z-score we can
get an approximate location of where our
data point lies
on the graph with regards to the mean
now the z score is given by subtracting
the data point from the mean and
dividing it by standard deviation
this can also be written as x minus mu
divided by sigma now any normal
distribution can be standardized by
converting its values into z scores the
z-score will tell you how many standard
deviation from the mean each values lie
while data points are referred to as x
and normal distribution they are called
z or z scores in the z distribution a
z-score is a standard score that will
tell you how many standard deviations
away from the mean an individual point
will lie
a positive z-score will mean that your
x-value is greater than the mean and a
negative z-score will mean that your x
value is less than the mean
a z score of 0 will mean that your x
value is equal to the mean
and again to standardize a value from a
normal distribution all we have to do is
convert it to a z score by subtracting
the mean from our individual value and
dividing it by the standard deviation
now let's see how we can find the z
score from data points with the help of
a solved example
let's do a case study
in this case study we'll be taking the
summary of daily travel time of a person
who's commuting to and from work
all these values are in minutes and
using these values we have to calculate
the mean the standard deviation and the
z-score
these values are as shown as we can see
there are 13 values in total let's start
by finding the mean
the mean is the average and it can be
gotten by adding all of these values and
dividing it by the total number of
values
this gives us a value of 38.6
the mean tells us the average of all our
data points which means on an average he
travels
for 38.6 minutes to reach work
next let's subtract the individual
values from our mean
and calculate the variance and standard
deviation
the values on the left give us the
values that we get after subtracting it
from the mean and the variance can be
calculated by squaring all of these
values adding up all of the squared
values and dividing it by the total
number of values
at the end of the day we get a variance
of 140.
to calculate the standard deviation all
we have to do is take a square root of
the variance
which gives us a value of 11.8
now the mean signifies the average of
our values and we already know this it
gives us the average time which is taken
to travel but the standard deviation
will tell us the average value of how
much our data points differ from the
mean
it tells us the deviation within our own
data and it tells us
how far away on an average a point is
from the mean
now the value that we get is 11.8 which
means that on an average
a single data point
is around 11.8 data points away from the
mean
now let's calculate the z-score
the z-score is given by subtracting
individual data points from the mean and
dividing it by the standard deviation
we know that we have a standard
deviation of 11.8 and a mean of 38.6
using these values we can calculate the
z scores for individual x values
now we know that a negative z score
means that our x value is lower than our
mean
but what does the number 1.06 mean
this means that the z-score for 26 is
1.06 standard deviations
away from the mean the negative symbol
here means that our x value is less than
the mean
and by how less
1.06 times the standard deviation now we
know that the negative value of a z
score means that
our x value is less than our mean but
what does the number 1.06 mean
this means
that the z-score is 1.06 times the
standard deviation less than the mean
the same thing can be said for the
z-score of 33. it is 0.47 times the
standard deviation
less
than the mean
the z-score of 65 is 2.23 times the
standard deviation
more than the mean that means it has to
be added to the mean
the reason that we know it's more than
the mean is because this has a positive
value
so this means that using z scores we can
know where our data points fall relative
to other points on the graph
the z score will tell us how far away
from the
mean a point is in steps of our standard
deviation
basics and terminology
the first one is outcome
whenever we do an experiment like
flipping a coin or rolling a dice we get
an outcome for example if we flip a coin
we get an outcome of heads or tails and
if we roll a die we get an outcome of 1
2 3 4 5 or 6.
random experiment
a random experiment is any well-defined
procedure that produces an observable
outcome that could not be perfectly
predicted in advance
a random experiment must be well defined
to eliminate any vagueness or surprise
it must produce a definite observable
outcome so that you know what happened
after the random experiment is run
random events
consider a simple example
let's say that we toss a coin up in the
air
what can happen when it gets back it
either gives a head or a tail
these two are known as outcome and the
occurrence of an outcome is an event
thus the event is the outcome of some
phenomenon
the last one is sample space
a sample space is a collection or a set
of possible outcomes of a random
experiment
the sample space is represented using
the symbol s
the subset of all possible outcomes of
an experiment is called events and a
sample space may contain a number of
outcomes that depends on the experiment
if it contains a finite number of
outcomes then it is known as a discrete
or finite sample spaces
now let's discuss what is random
variable
a random variable is a numerical
description of the outcome of a
statistical experiment
a random variable that may assume only a
finite number of values is said to be
discrete
one that may assume any value in some
interval on the real number line is said
to be continuous
let's see an example
let x be a random variable defined as
the sum of numbers when two dices are
ruled
x can assume the values 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 and 12.
notice there is no one here because the
sum of the two dice can never be one
now that we know the basics let's move
on to binomial distribution
the binomial distribution is used when
there are exactly two mutually exclusive
outcomes of a trial
these outcomes are appropriately labeled
success and failure
the binomial distribution is used to
obtain the probability of observing x
successes in n number of trials
with the probability of success on a
single trial denoted by p
the binomial distribution assumes that p
is fixed for all the trials
here is a real life example of a
binomial distribution
suppose you purchase a lottery ticket
then either you are going to win the
lottery or not in other words the
outcome will be either success or
failure that can be proved through
binomial distribution
there are four important conditions that
needs to be fulfilled for an experiment
to be a binomial experiment
the first one is there should be a fixed
number of entries carried out
the outcome of a given trial
is only two that is either a success or
a failure
the probability of success remains
constant from trial to trial it does not
changes from one trial to another
and the trials are independent the
outcome of a trial is not affected by
the outcome of any other trial
to calculate the binomial coefficient we
use the formula which is n c r into p to
the power r into 1 minus p
to the power n minus r
where r is the number of success in n
number of trials and p is the
probability of success 1 minus p denotes
the probability of a failure
now let's use this formula to solve an
example
suppose a die is tossed three times what
is the probability of no five turning up
one five and three fives turning out
to calculate the no five turning up here
r is equal to 0 and n is equal to 3
substituting the value in the formula we
have 3c0 into 1 by 6 to the power 0 into
5 by 6 to the power 3
where 1 by 6 is the probability of
success and 5 by 6 is the probability of
failure
calculating this equation will get the
value to be 0.5787
in a similar manner to calculate the
probability of 1 5 turning up we'll
replace r with 1 and n will be 3 so p x
1 will be equal to 3 c 1 into 1 by 6 to
the power 1 into 5 by 6 to the power 2
which will come out to be 0.347
and for 3 5 turning up we'll substitute
r equal to 3 and the formula will remain
the same and we'll get the value to be
0.0046
now that we are done with the concepts
of animal probability distribution here
is a problem for you to solve
post your answers in the comment section
and let us know
a poison distribution is a probability
distribution used in statistics to show
how many times an event is likely to
happen over a given period of time to
put it another way it's a count
distribution
poisson distribution are frequently used
to comprehend independent event at a
constant rate over a given interval of
time
the positive distribution was developed
by french mathematician simon dennis
poison in 1837
a poisson distribution is used in cases
where the chances of any individual
event being a success is very small
number of defective pencils per box of a
6000 pencil
the number of plane crashes in india in
one year
all the number of printing mistakes in
each page of a book
all of these examples can have use of
person distribution
the poisson distribution can be used to
calculate how likely it is that
something will happen x number of times
a random variable x has a poisson
distribution with parameter lambda and
the formula for that is e to the power
minus lambda
into lambda to the power x divided by x
factorial
where x can be the number of times the
event is happening
the value of e is taken as 2.7182
let's discuss some application of
poisson distribution
if you want to calculate the number of
deaths per day
or week due to rare disease in a
hospital you can use the poisson
distribution
in a similar manner the count of
bacteria per cc in blood or the number
of computers infected as virus per week
the number of mishandled baggage per
thousand passengers can also have an
application for poison distribution
let's discuss one example to see how you
can calculate a poisson distribution
suppose on an average a cancer kills
five people each year in india
what is the probability that one person
is killed this year
we'll assume all these events are
independent random events
so by the formula
we have x is equal to 1 because we have
to calculate the probability of one
percent that is kill this year
so p x equal to 1 will be equal to e to
the power -5 into 5 to the power 1
divided by 1 factorial which will come
out to be 0.033
which will be near to 3.3 percent
so
the probability that only one person in
skill this year due to cancer is 2.3
percent
now we have one question for you
do try to answer in the comment section
suppose the trains arrive at a railway
station with an average arrival rate of
4 trains per hour
what is the probability exactly 6
strains will arrive in a 2 hour period
