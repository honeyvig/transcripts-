yeah very good morning one and all so we
are at the toughest jewel of our
preparation okay
so considering all the modules and all
the revision pattern and everything so
right now we are at the toughest John
one is about approach towards the
subject my ideology of adding your
toughest Jonas one is ideology towards
the subject are approaching towards the
subject and second one is up to a
particular level the scoring in this
particular AI is very easy but once you
cross that threshold score scoring in
this area is also very very difficult
and this area unfortunately it's going
to decide your great ranks like if you
are planning to have a single digit or a
double digit or a rank below 100 this
John is very very important and you need
to cross that threshold score in this
zone which is going to play a very vital
role in the examination hall so whenever
you have tough things or whenever you
have tough days the main approach of an
individual is how you handle that how
you simplify that and how you approach
that so I'm just going to give a brief
idea like how you need to handle this
upcoming few days which are very very
important and I'm more specific about
the first for this ok so the first four
days are 27 28 29 and the 30th
ok so already your schedules and the
tasks and the things to be done were
clearly posted on the display pic of the
group
I'm not going to brief them but first of
all topics to be covering this four days
gentle farmer first one first important
one so you have one YouTube video of
gentle farmer covering all aspects okay
so there is no need of any discussion or
general pharmacology if you are done
with that 45 minutes of or to one hour
video which is very very important
covering all the aspects and the second
important aspect that you need to cover
in general for my is your dental pulse
so if you cover these two I feel that is
more than sufficient to handle general
pharmacology and this topic is done so
the next course is chemotherapy so
chemotherapy the first important thing
that you need to cover is your dental
pulse not well but it is monitored that
you need to finish it then you need to
go for worship time for the list out the
topics or the or the agents which are
really required to be focused in this
chemotherapy so these two things has to
be done mandatory at any cost the next
important thing that is listed is
infections it is already done in module
two but I want you guys to finish it in
general medicine and oral pathology that
is viral bacterial fungal things and
recently we have done microbiology to
where most of the aspects of this
infections were clearly covered okay so
it's it's like you need to recap you
need to revise the things which are
already done okay so that's all about
the chemotherapy general pharmacology
and infections and the next comes is
serious CNS and AMS so these things to
be covered in various subjects like you
need to focus on these topics in your
physiology general medicine and your
pharmacology for AMS and CVS we have
videos that are available on the YouTube
so you need to finish the YouTube videos
first and then you need to go ahead with
the dental pulse reading of all the
subjects that is physio medicine and
pharmacology and followed by you need to
attend discussions on the group so this
is all about the first three days that
is 27 28 29 and 30th hope things are
very clear pharmacology general form
ecology need to cover the YouTube video
first then you need to go ahead and
finish the rental buzz chemotherapy you
need to cover the dental pulse and you
need to follow the discussions that are
being taking all the group and you need
to cover few areas few agents of
chemotherapy is posh uptil then after
infections which is already done you
need to cover infections in general
medicine and you need to cover
infections in URL path oral medicine
that is biology bacterial gene my
ecology along with the microbiology that
is covered recently then after we need
to deal with the three systems that is
CBS CNN SNS and most of these are
available as a YouTube videos covering
almost all the aspects again you need to
go ahead with the gentle pulse in an
hour that is fast physiology gentleman
then followed by the pharmacology I'm
going to add few mnemonics and few
repeats and few multi-directional
revision from all the ways including
repeats few key factors that are that to
be noted down hope this is clear
all the best
the most important ingredient that is
really required right now is your
positiveness towards the subject and
your positiveness and positive attitude
towards the preparation and the second
most important thing is about building
your confidence levels as days
approaches as we know the days are
approaching roughly 80 days it therefore
you're examined I want you to be more
confident talk with the friends or the
talk with the people or talk with the
talk with the like beings for who are
going to increase your confidence levels
rather than talking with the negative
people and if you feel this particular
situation or a particular person or a
particular thing is going to install
some negativeness in you stay away from
them stay away from such situation stay
away from such people okay because your
confidence is the one driving force that
is really required right thank you on
