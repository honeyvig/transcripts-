relationship between the clinical and
histological features in periodontal
pocket
so before going into this uh interesting
aspect of
correlating the clinical and
histological futures which is one of the
favorite area when i used to prepare in
my final year
you have to make a note of one important
thing about the periodontal pocket
periodontal pockets are chronic
inflammatory lesions
so they are of chronic time they they
cannot be seen as an acute
time the chronic time and they always
undergoes
repair repair is something which is
always there in the periodontal pocket
and make a note periodontal pockets
never
have complete healing means one side
they will have destruction
and other side they will have
construction construction is
a body mechanism iris destruction is the
mechanism by the leftover bacteria which
are present in that area
so that is called as a combination of
both it means it always try to repair
but there is some sort of destruction so
there is no complete healing in the case
of
periodontal pocket right so the next
important aspect that you have to make a
note is about the correlation
between these okay so the clinical
future is
whenever you have a gingival wall of the
pocket
having various degree of bluish
red discoloration okay you'll have the
smooth
shiny surface which spits on pressure
and everything
so what correlated histological feature
you can appreciate is
the discoloration is basically due to
the stagnation of circulation means
blood statuses okay and if you see the
shiny and
shiny smooth entropy surface
okay of the epithelium and there is
edema the edema is the main reason for
the pitting on pressure
so you have pitting on pressure and
pitting on pressure is basically due to
the
edema or that particular area the next
one when you have a pink and firm
color gingival ball okay so the pink and
form ginger
alone gives an idea that it is a
fibrotic
change okay you'll have a fibrotic
change
and sometimes what happens is uh the
external appearance
of the external appearance of a healthy
and inner
inner wall of periodontal uh pocket
having a various degrees of degeneration
and also sometimes you'll have
ulceration
which can be seen as a red color the
next one is
bleeding so bleeding is basically due to
increasing in vascularity
okay increasing vascularity the primary
reason for the bleeding
and the second one is the internal
aspect of the pocket is generally
painful
okay when when it is painful the pain on
tactile is due to the
ulceration of the pocket that is the
reason and when you have pus
okay i mean like first we are going to
talk in detail so when you have pus
pass in the pockets is due to due to
giving an idea that
they have some sort of inflammation this
is how a clinical scenario is correlated
to the
histological aspect the next comes is
pus
and its relationship with the pocket so
make a note this is a very good
statement that is given in your currency
that is pus is a common future of
periodontal disease
but it is only a secondary sign
okay first is a second reason hope we
have discussed the
difference between the symptoms symptoms
are something which are given by the
patient
signs are something which are
appreciated by the physician right
so this is a secondary sign
and making out the nature of the
inflammatory changes in the pocket wall
so this bus is going to give the nature
of the
change in the pocket wall so it's going
to give the nature
of changes in the pocket wall so that is
the main
area where the bus is going to play a
very very
vital role so excessive excessive pass
okay so when you when you will have when
you have an excessive pass
okay then you can diagnosis it as a
shallow pocket
well you can diagnosis it as a shallow
pocket whereas in the case of deep
pockets
you have no pass or a very little bus
right these are the two important points
that you have to make about excessive
pulse
a shallow pocket whereas no pus or a
little plus you can diagnosis it as in a
deep pocket the next important area is
the mineral content of the exposed
cementum so already known that
whenever you have a gingival resistant
the cementum will get
exposed right so what is the changes of
mineral content in
exposed cementum the mineral content of
an exposed cementum
increases the first important point it
increases
so what are the parameters which
increases in this exposed cementum or in
the case of
root carriers exposed cementum is
nothing but it will dissolve and it'll
lead to root cares
so you will have increasing in the
calcium
you will have increasing in the
magnesium
you will have increasing in the
phosphorus you'll have increasing in the
fluoride content but make a note okay
but make a note the micro hardness of
this cementum remains
unchanged
remains same micro hardness remains
same whereas the calcium magnesium
phosphorus and fluoride contents
increases in the case of exposure
cementum
or root cares
the next this is again an interesting
area i feel like they can ask questions
over this
so they can give you a different areas
different areas or they can ask a
sequence based question
that is the first one is calculus
okay followed by you will have some sort
of attached
attached plaque and followed by
you will have a zone of unattached black
followed by you'll have a zone of
junctional epithelium
okay so junction epithelium this zone of
junctional epithelium
and uh in a normal sulcus the zone of
junctional epithelium
is going to be somewhere around 500
milliamp
whereas in the case of whereas in the
case of periodontal pocket so in the
periodontal pocket it is destroyed right
so whenever it is destroyed it is going
to be 100 mu mm
ah then you will have a semi destroyed
connective tissue that is called as
partially lysed connective tissue then
you will have an intact connective
tissue so this is a sequence so they can
ask you a sequence based question
or they can turn this diagram into a
diagram based question so please do
make a note of this particular area
the next question of course is this
most favorite question for most of you
in your final year that is the
difference between infra bony pocket
and the supra bony pocket
so i i i hope you can you can just
understand
uh by by reading the content okay they
can ask you like which of the following
statement is related to infra bony
pocket or which of the following
statement is related to supra bonus
they can simply ask you to uh identify
the difference between infra and supra
so please do make a note of this
okay it's completely self-explanatory
aspect
and the next comes is the clinical
future okay you can see
a good periodontal abscess so learn
something related to periodontal labs is
the first statement
an important statement of course
questions which were given in the
previous examinations
uh this is a very important area
periodontal pocket is also called
as lateral abs spiridontal abscess is
also called as later lapses because
it is present lateral side to the tooth
surface and it is also
called as
parietal abscess right so these are the
two statements that you have to make
so there is a difference between
gingival abscess and
periodontal abstracts periodontal
abscess is basically due to the
deepening of the
destruction that is an extension of the
periodontal pocket whereas gingival
absence is
due to the changes in the gingiva so
that's that is how you can differentiate
uh the periodontal abscess from that of
the
uh gingival abscess okay so don't get
confused
so these are the important things that
you have to make and what about these
two different types of periodontal and
gingival abscess
okay so i'm done for now signing off dr
